<strong>B.
User-Provided Information Through Plaid and Other Third Party Integrations</strong>
<br>
<p>Our Service may allow you to connect your third party accounts, including your financial accounts, to your Truebill account.
We use Plaid and other third party integrations to provide this functionality to you.
In order to connect your third party accounts to your Truebill account, you must expressly authorize such connection when first registering your Truebill account or at a later time through your account settings.
You may terminate this connection at any time through your account settings.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>When you connect your third party accounts to your Truebill account, you give Truebill and the third party integration the authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your information from the relevant bank or other entity that provides your accounts.

<p>‍<br>
</p>
<strong>C.
Automatically Collected Information</strong>
<br>
<p>When you use the Service or open one of our HTML emails, we (or our service providers or vendors) automatically collect certain information from your web browser and through your device by using different types of technology, including “cookies,” “log files,” "pixels," and other tracking technologies.
This automatically collected information includes:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Device Data</strong>, including data about device identifiers such as IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, and your device’s regional and language settings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Service Use Data</strong>, including data about the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Service, the pages you view on the Service, your actions on the Service, features you use, emails and advertisements you view, products and services you view and purchase, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Location Data</strong>, including imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level).<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>‍</p>
<p>The types of tracking technologies used include:&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cookies.
</strong>When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device.
We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service to personalize your experience, remember your preferences, and support security features.
Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service.
Persistent cookies can be removed.
Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.
Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pixels and JavaScript.
</strong>Pixels (also known as web beacons) are code<strong>
</strong>embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that send information about your use to a server.
There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contain JavaScript code).
When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to write or read cookies on your browser.
Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device.
We may incorporate pixels from separate entities that allow us to track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality.&nbsp.
&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Device Fingerprinting.
</strong>This is the process of analyzing and combining sets of data elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your browser and device.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>App Technologies.</strong> These technologies are included in our Apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.
For example, our Apps may include SDKs (e.g., the Facebook SDK), which is code that sends information about your use to a server.
These SDKs allow us to track our conversions, bring your advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your Google account.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>‍<br>
</p>
<p>For further information on how we use tracking technologies for analytics and advertising, and your rights and choices regarding them, see the “Analytics and Advertising” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections below.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong>

You may terminate this connection at any time through your account settings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Analytics and Advertising</strong>.
We share information with vendors and other parties for our analytics and advertising related purposes.
These parties may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.
For more information on advertising and analytics, see the “Analytics and Advertising” section below.&nbsp;</li>

When you voluntarily enter a promotion, we share information as set out in the official rules that govern the promotion as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list).
By entering a promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other entities to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.</li>
<li>

<p>‍<br>
</p>
<strong>Analytics and Advertising</strong>
<br>
<p>We use analytics services, such as Amplitude, to help us understand how users access and use the Service.
In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services.
For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service (including our Site, Apps, and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services.
Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>”).<br>
</p>
<p>We also use audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Service or are identified in one or more of our databases (“<strong>Matched Ads</strong>”).
This is done by us uploading a customer list to another party or incorporating a pixel or SDK from another party into our own Service, and the other party matching common factors between our data and their data or other datasets.
For instance, we incorporate the Facebook SDK on our Service and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>As indicated above, vendors and other parties may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.<br>
</p>
<p>For further information on the types of tracking technologies we use on the Service and your rights and choices regarding analytics, Interest-based Advertising, and Matched Ads, please see the “Information Collected Automatically” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections.</p>

<li>
<strong>In-Service Offers.
</strong>If you have a Truebill account, we may show you offers within your account or by email that are personalized to you based on information you have provided to us.<strong>

We may get a commission from the partner if you purchase a product or service after clicking on the offer.&nbsp;</li>
<li>

<strong>Cookies and Pixels.
</strong>Most browsers accept cookies by default.
You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies.
If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately.
Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do Not Track.
</strong>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit.
Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals.
Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals.&nbsp.
For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit https://www.allaboutdnt.com.</li>
<li>
<strong>App and Imprecise Location Technologies.

<strong>Google Analytics and Advertising.
</strong>Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb.
&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Interest-based Advertising.
</strong>The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads.
Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“<strong>DAA</strong>”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“<strong>NAI</strong>”).
To learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/choices.
(ii) for app targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
and (iii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile Device.
</strong>You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser, device, account, email address, and/or phone number from which you opt out.
It will not affect subsequent subscriptions (where applicable).
We are not responsible for any other entities’ effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of their statements regarding their opt out options or programs.</p>
