The trademarks, service marks, logos, product names and company names (the “Trademarks”) used and displayed on or through the Services are registered and unregistered trademarks or service marks of Confide and its licensors.
Nothing in the Services or in the Terms of Service shall be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use the Trademarks, without our prior written permission specific for each such use.
All goodwill generated from the use of the Trademarks inures to the benefit of Confide and its licensors, as applicable.</p>
<p>Elements of the Services are protected by trade dress, trademark, unfair competition, and other state and federal laws and may not be copied or imitated, in whole or in part, by any means, including but not limited to the use of framing or mirrors.</p>
<br> 16.

<p>Our designated agent under the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.

<br> 17.
GOVERNING LAW.
EQUITABLE RELIEF <p>
<b>Governing Law</b>.
The Terms of Service and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
<p>
<b>Equitable Relief</b>.
You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the Terms of Service.
We may, without waiving any other remedies under the Terms of Service, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above.
You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan for purposes of any such action by us.</p>
<br> 18.
DISPUTES.
ARBITRATION <p>
<b>Initial Dispute Resolution</b>.
You agree to use your best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question or disagreement directly through consultation with Confide’s customer support.
Please contact us before initiating any lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
<p>The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, or the Application shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association.
The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against Confide in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against Confide any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
By using the Services or the Application in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.
In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Confide (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court).
YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.
Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.
You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Confide (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York.
You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes and you irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury.
The Terms of Service, and any dispute between you and Confide, shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>

MISCELLANEOUS <p>
<b>Entire Agreement</b>.
Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, the Terms of Service, including our Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter.</p>
<p>
<b>Export Controls</b>.
The Services and the underlying information and technology are subject to US and international laws, restrictions and regulations that may govern the import, export, downloading and use of the Services.
You agree to comply with these laws, restrictions and regulations when downloading or using the Services</p>
<p>
<b>Severability</b>.
If any provision of the Terms of Service is deemed by a competent court or arbitrator to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court or arbitrator should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the applicable provision, and any unenforceable provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision.</p>
<p>
<b>Communications Decency Act Notice</b>.
Confide is a provider of “interactive computer services” as defined under the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C.
Section 230, and as such, our liability for defamation, libel, product disparagement, and other claims arising out of any communications sent by our users is limited as described therein.
We are not responsible for any communications of our users.
We neither warrant the accuracy of communications or exercise any editorial control over communications, nor do we assume any legal obligation for editorial control of communications or liability in connection with communications, including any responsibility or liability for investigating or verifying the accuracy of any communications.
In fact, as noted in our Privacy Policy, we do not (and cannot) read encrypted communications</p>
<p>
<b>Section Headings</b>.
The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import.</p>
<p>
<b>Force Majeure</b>.
Confide shall not be liable to you or others for failure to perform under the Terms of Service if the failure results, directly or indirectly, from government action or inaction, mechanical or electrical breakdown, war, civil unrest, natural disaster or other cause beyond its reasonable control.
If you are affected by an interruption of delay contemplated by this section, Confide will use its commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the interruption of delay if it is reasonably capable of being remedied.</p>
<p>
<b>Waiver</b>.
Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in the Terms of Service.
No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.</p>
<p>
<b>Binding Agreement</b>.
The Terms of Service shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties</p>
<p>
<b>Compliance with Applicable Laws</b>.
The Services are based in the U.S.
We make no claims concerning whether the Services may be used or are appropriate for use outside of the United States or for your particular industry, company, or intended use.
Your access to and use of the Services is solely at your own risk.
You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the applicable laws of your specific jurisdiction and industry</p>
<p>
<b>Ambiguous Terms</b>.
Any ambiguities in the Terms of Service will not be strictly construed against the drafter of the language concerned but will be resolved by applying the most reasonable interpretation under the circumstances, giving full consideration to the intentions of the parties at the time of contracting.
The Terms of Service will not be construed against any party by reason of its preparation.</p>
<br> 20.
ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY <p>Confide respects free and open discussion and dissemination of information.
When there are competing interests at issue, however, Confide reserves the right to take certain preventive or corrective actions.
In order to protect these competing interests, Confide has developed this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”), which supplements and explains certain terms in the Terms of Service and further defines your rights and obligations when utilizing the Services.
This AUP may be revised from time to time, without any obligation to notify you of the same.
Your use of the Services after changes to this AUP are made available through the Services shall constitute your acceptance of any new or additional terms.</p>
<p>When you obtain information via the Services, you must keep in mind that we cannot, and do not make any attempt to monitor, verify, warrant, or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information that you may acquire.
For this reason, you must exercise your best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Services, and also should be aware that some material may be offensive.
Because we cannot monitor or censor the Services, and will not attempt to do so, Confide shall not be responsible for injury to you that results from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive, or illegal communications</p>
<p>When you disseminate information via the Services, you must keep in mind that Confide does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information you may create.
When you place information on the Services, you have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech.
Also, because the information you create is carried over networks and may reach a large number of people, your communications may affect other users and may harm our goodwill, business reputation, and operations.
For these reasons, you violate this AUP and the Terms of Service when you engage in or facilitate the following prohibited activities:</p>
<p>
<b>Intellectual Property Violations</b>.
Using the Services to engage in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, or privacy or publicity rights held by individuals, corporations, or other entities.
We are required by law to remove or block access to user content upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement.
It is also our policy to terminate the privileges of users who violate copyright laws.</p>
<p>
<b>Obscene Speech or Materials</b>.
Using the Services to view, advertise, transmit, store, post, display, or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene speech or material.
We are required by law to notify law enforcement agencies when we become aware of the presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through the Services.</p>
<p>
<b>Defamatory or Abusive Language</b>.
Using the Services as a means to transmit or post defamatory, harassing, abusive, or threatening language.</p>
<p>
<b>Spamming</b>.
Using the Services to send unsolicited bulk and/or commercial messages (known as “spamming”).
Spamming is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward Confide, but also because it can overload our networks and disrupt service to our other users.
When a complaint is received, we have the discretion to determine from all of the evidence whether the recipients were from an “opt-in” email list.</p>
<p>
<b>Forging of Headers</b>.
Using the Services to forge or misrepresent message headers, whether in whole or in part, to mask the originator of the message.</p>
<p>
<b>Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks</b>.
Using the Services to access illegally or without authorization computers, accounts, or networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security measures of another individual’s system (often known as “hacking”).
Also, any activity that might be used as a precursor to an attempted system penetration (i.e.
port scan, stealth scan, or other information gathering activity).</p>
<p>
<b>Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, or Other Destructive Activities</b>.
Using the Services to distribute information regarding the creation of and sending Internet viruses, worms, trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mailbombing, or denial of service attacks.</p>
<p>
<b>Export Control Violations</b>.
Using the Services to export encryption software to points outside the United States.</p>
<p>
<b>Other Unlawful Uses</b>.
Using the Services for any unlawful purpose, including, without limitation, advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards, or pirating content.</p>
<p>
<b>Market Research</b>.
Using the Services to collect any market research for a competing business.</p>
<p>
<b>Interference</b>.
Taking any action that imposes or may impose (in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our technical infrastructure.
using automated means, including spiders, robots, crawlers, data mining tools, or the like to download or scrape data from the Website, except for Internet search engines (e.g., Google) and non-commercial public archives (e.g., archive.org) that comply with our robots.txt file.
or interfering with or attempting to interrupt the proper operation of the Services through the use of any virus, device, information collection or transmission mechanism, software or routine, or access or attempt to gain access to any data, files, or passwords related to the Services through hacking, password or data mining, or any other means.</p>
<p>
<b>Other Activities</b>.
Using the Services to engage in activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that Confide determines to be harmful to our users, operations, reputation, goodwill, or customer relations.</p>
<p>The responsibility for avoiding the harmful activities just described rests primarily with you.
We do not (and cannot) read or monitor the contents of the communications of our users to ensure that they comply with the Terms of Service, this AUP, or applicable law.
However, if we become aware of harmful activities, we may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to, removing information, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to Confide’s website, Application and/or Services, or taking any other action that we deem appropriate in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying your obligations as a responsible user of the Services.
Any complaints about a user’s violation of this AUP should be sent to support@getconfide.com.</p>
