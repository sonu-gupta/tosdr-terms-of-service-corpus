<p> Lifter Terms and Conditions </p>
<p> September 2019 </p>
<p> These terms and conditions are an agreement between Tidelift, Inc.
(“Tidelift”, “We”, or “Us”), a Delaware corporation, and the person or entity identified in the attached Lifter Information Form (“Lifter” or “You”).
</p>
<p> Tidelift wants to pay you to provide certain software maintenance, support, analysis, or other services to Tidelift and Tidelift’s Subscribers (the “Services”, as further defined below), and you want to provide such services.
</p>
<p> You and Tidelift therefore agree as follows: </p> 1&nbsp;Services 1.1&nbsp;What services will you provide while you’re a Lifter? <p> During the term of this agreement, you will provide the Services in accordance with this agreement.
Depending on the nature of the specific Service, Services may be provided to Tidelift through our software platform, or to the broader open source community through standard open source project maintenance tools.
More information on the Services we currently require Lifters to provide is in our documentation, currently available at tidelift.com/docs/lifting/tasks-overview.
</p> 1.2&nbsp;What may Tidelift require if the Services are not satisfactory? <p> If you do not satisfactorily provide the Services, Tidelift may, at its option and without limitation, (a) require you to immediately re-perform the applicable Service at no additional charge.
and/or (b) reduce the fees paid, or due to be paid, to you for the applicable Service in an amount commensurate with the cost to the Subscriber to cover the breach and/or the cost to Tidelift to assist its Subscriber with covering the breach.
</p> 2&nbsp;Payment 2.1&nbsp;How much will you be paid? <p> Unless otherwise specified in the attached Lifter Information Form, Tidelift will pay you for the Services as determined based on our then-current payment algorithm.
Factors that we may consider, at our sole discretion, may include usage of the Project by our Subscribers, level of maintenance performed, and overall number of Subscribers.
More information on the way we currently calculate payments is in our documentation, currently available here.
</p> 2.2&nbsp;How will you be paid? <p> Tidelift will pay you monthly, in United States dollars.
Payments will be made through our payments system, using the mechanisms specified when the payments account is created.
You are responsible for keeping any payment information updated.
More information on the way we currently make payments is in our documentation, currently available here.
</p> 3&nbsp;Licenses and Open Source 3.1&nbsp;Do you need to grant Tidelift any rights to the software? <p> The Services will consist in part of maintaining and updating open source software that is licensed and made available to the public by its copyright owners or licensees.
This agreement does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;attempt to license or assign such rights to Tidelift, and should not be construed to do so.
</p> 3.2&nbsp;Will you give Tidelift Subscribers a chance to fix their mistakes before suing them for violating the license on your open source code? <p> Before filing any legal proceeding or claim (other than a Defensive Action) against a Subscriber arising from termination of the Project’s license, you will extend to the Subscriber the following provisions regarding cure and reinstatement: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> As used in this section, the term ‘this License’ refers to the particular Project’s License being enforced, and ‘Defensive Action’ means a legal proceeding or claim that you bring against a Subscriber in response to a prior proceeding or claim initiated by the Subscriber.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> If Subscriber ceases all violation of this License, then Subscriber’s license from you is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until you explicitly and finally terminate Subscriber’s license, and (b) permanently, if you fail to notify Subscriber of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> Moreover, Subscriber’s license from you is reinstated permanently if you notify Subscriber of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time Subscriber has received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from you, and Subscriber cures the violation prior to 30 days after Subscriber’s receipt of the notice.
</p>
</blockquote> 3.3&nbsp;What promises do you make about your contributions to the software? <p> You confirm that the contributions you have made to the Project (i) were created in whole or in part by you, and you had the right to submit them under the open source license indicated by the Project.
or (ii) were based upon previous work that, to the best of your knowledge, was covered under an appropriate open source license, and you have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by you, under the same open source license (unless you are permitted by the Project to submit under a different license).
</p> 3.4&nbsp;What about other contributors to the software? <p> Tidelift acknowledges that Sections 3.2 and 3.3 do not govern other contributors to the Project, and that you have made no representations on their behalf.
</p> 4&nbsp;Feedback and Trademarks 4.1&nbsp;How can Tidelift use suggestions you make? <p> You may, but are not obligated to, provide comments, suggestions, feedback, or ideas about the Services (“Feedback”).
You hereby grant Tidelift a license to use or otherwise exploit the Feedback without limitations, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing in advance.
</p> 4.2&nbsp;How can we promote each other? <p> Tidelift may name you, and display any logos you may provide us, in places where we promote Lifters or Lifters’ projects, such as Tidelift.com.
You must only provide us with logos you have the right to provide us to use under these terms and conditions.
If you cannot provide us with such logos, you must notify us.
</p>
<p> You may name us, and display our logo, in places where the Project is promoted (such as its website), subject to any requirements we set out in our branding guidelines, currently available here.
</p>
<p> Each of us retains our own rights in its own trademarks and logos.
</p> 5&nbsp;Termination 5.1&nbsp;When can you terminate this agreement? <p> You may terminate this agreement, for any reason or no reason, with 30 or more days written notice to Tidelift.
</p> 5.2&nbsp;When can either of us terminate this agreement? <p> Either party may terminate this agreement immediately, without notice, if the other party (or any paid subcontractors, as identified to Tidelift under Section 7.1) materially defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under the agreement.
Material defaults may include: </p>
<ul>
<li>failure to complete tasks set out in the Tidelift software platform (including ineffective or inaccurate completion);</li>
<li>violations of the Lifter Code of Conduct, currently available here;</li>
<li>violation of applicable laws (including without limitation, laws governing intellectual property);</li>
<li>violations of sections of the Terms of Service that provide that Tidelift can immediately terminate a user’s account.
or</li>
<li>any attempts to manipulate or game compliance or scoring systems (including either those created by Tidelift or by host open source projects).</li>
</ul>
<p> For all other breaches of this Agreement, the non-breaching party will provide the allegedly breaching party with written notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure the breach.
If the allegedly breaching party does not cure the breach in a timely manner and to the non-breaching party's satisfaction, the non-breaching party can terminate this Agreement.
</p> 5.3&nbsp;What can you do if Tidelift terminates the agreement? <p> Your sole remedy for termination by Tidelift will be a payment pro-rated for any Services actually performed prior to the effective date of termination.
</p> 5.4&nbsp;What parts of the agreement will continue in effect if the agreement is terminated? <p> Upon termination or expiration of this agreement for any reason, Sections 1.2 (remedy for performance), 4.1 (use of suggestions), 5.3 (remedy for termination), 7 (Relationship and Delegation), 8 (Mutual Arbitration), 9 (Confidentiality), and 10 (Additional Legal Terms) will survive such termination or expiration.
</p> 6&nbsp;Updating the Agreement 6.1&nbsp;When can Tidelift update the Agreement? <p> Tidelift may update this agreement upon no less than 30 days prior notice to you, except that Section 9 (Arbitration) may be modified or terminated only by a writing accepted by both parties.
</p> 7&nbsp;Relationship and Delegation 7.1&nbsp;Can others perform the services for you? <p> Your obligations under this agreement may be performed by others, including paid subcontractors, in whole or in part.
However, if you subcontract your obligations under this agreement, you must identify the subcontractors to us by providing their Tidelift account information to us.

You are responsible for complying with your obligations to Tidelift under this Agreement, regardless of whether you have hired subcontractors to perform any of your obligations.
Such obligations include compliance with requirements at least as strict as those imposed by Sections 3.2, 3.3, 5.2, and 9.
</p> 7.3&nbsp;Can you engage in other related work? <p> Yes, you may engage in other work related to the Project, including paid consulting, service hosting, or solicitation of charitable donations.
</p> 7.4&nbsp;Are you a Tidelift employee? <p> No, you are not a Tidelift employee.

We do not intend for either party to be the agent, employee, or joint venturer of the other.

</p>
<p> you will determine the amount of time required to perform the Services, and will supply the software development tools and equipment necessary to perform the Services.

and </p>
<p> to the best of your knowledge, the Services you provide under this Agreement are different from any goods or services that Tidelift provides.

</p>

Both parties acknowledge that there are no bench or jury trials and no class actions or representative actions permitted under this Arbitration Agreement.
