<p>
<strong>Do we use 'cookies'?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes.
Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart.
They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.
We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.
You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings.

<strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
</p>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
Get more information here.
</p>
<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
<li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
</p>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
<p>
<strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
</p>
<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices should a data breach occur, we will notify the users via email within 7 business days</p>
<p>
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
<p>
<strong>CAN-SPAM Act</strong>
</p>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
<li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
<li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li>

<b>4.1 Primary Account Holder.</b>
Each user account will have one User who is designated as the Primary Account Holder.

a username and password) and/or the User that purchased the Nomorobo App via an authorized distributor.
Except where specifically stated within the Agreements, if you are the Primary Account Holder, your rights and obligations under the Agreements are exactly the same as any other User and any reference to "you" or "your" shall apply to all users, regardless of whether the user is the Primary Account Holder.

If you are the Primary Account Holder, your access to the paid service will start on the day that you tender payment for the paid service.
If you are not the Primary Account Holder, your access to the paid service will start on the day that the Primary Account Holder adds your number to his or her list of subscribed phone lines.
In either event, your access to the paid service ends at 11:59pm EST on the final day of the subscription period purchased by the Primary Account Holder (for example, a 3-month subscription purchased on January 15 will end at 11:59pm EST on March 14 for all phone lines subscribed through that account), unless you end the subscription earlier by either canceling your subscription pursuant to Subsection 4.6 or terminating the Agreements pursuant to Subsection 5.2.</p>

The Company has the sole and exclusive discretion to determine which renewal subscription is comparable to your prior subscription.
however, in the event that you are dissatisfied with the renewal option selected by the Company, you may alter the subscription during the cooling off period as discussed in Subsection 4.7.
If you have signed up for automatic renewal but the payment information you have provided to the Company is no longer current at the time of your subscription renewal, your subscription will not automatically renew, but instead will expire at the end of its term as if you had not selected automatic renewal or automatic payment.</p>

<p>
<b>Infringement of Intellectual Property.</b> If the claim relates to theft, infringement, or other misuse of a party's intellectual property, including infringement of a trademark or servicemark or copying or distributing the Protected Data, the claiming party need not rely on binding arbitration and need not attempt informal resolution, but instead may immediately seek relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Small Claims.</b> The claimant may seek resolution of any dispute in small claims court in Suffolk County, New York, provided that all claims between the parties fall within the jurisdiction of the small claims court and were not able to be resolved by the informal resolution procedure described in Paragraph 6.3(ii) below.

If you do not wish to continue to use the Nomorobo Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by following the procedures discussed in Subsections 4.6 or 5.2.</p>
<p>
You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review the Agreements periodically to maintain awareness of the most current terms of the Agreements.

<p>
<b>6.7 Severability.</b>

<p>
<b>6.9 Force Majeure.</b>
