<strong>Web Measurement and Customization</strong>
<p>We use web measurement and customization technologies, such as cookies, to help our website function better for visitors and to better understand how the public is using our website.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use <strong>session</strong> cookies to gather data for technical purposes, such as generating aggregated statistics through analytics tools about how our websites are used.
We also use session cookies in the following instances:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Visiting CPSC Pages on Third-Party Websites
<p>We maintain accounts on third-party websites, such as social media sites, as tools to better interact with the public.
Your activity on those third-party websites is governed by the security and privacy policies of those sites.
Users of third-party websites are often sharing information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the website.
These actors may use this information in a variety of ways.
You should review the privacy policies of third-party websites before using them and ensure that you understand how your information may be used.
You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party website to match your preferences.</p>
<p>CPSC uses the following third-party websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter (Privacy)</li>
<li>YouTube (Privacy)</li>
<li>Flickr (Privacy)</li>
<li>Google+ (Privacy)</li>
<li>Slideshare (Privacy)</li>
<li>Storify (Privacy)</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the services on these third-party sites, anonymous usage statistics that do not contain PII are made available to users to understand the amount of traffic and use of the content.
Designated CPSC staff reviews this data to help improve our efforts on these websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Third-Party Applications on CPSC Websites
<p>CPSC’s websites use some third-party applications to enhance visitor accessibility of information and to maintain website security.
No PII will become available to the CPSC as a result of your use of any of these applications.</p>
<p>CPSC uses the following third-party applications on its websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-Tail Ad Solutions Inc’s JW Video Player (Privacy)</li>
<li>ClearSpring Technologies Inc.’s AddThis Sharing Tool (Privacy): Clearspring will have access to PII only if you explicitly provide it with this information, such as asking the company to send an e-mail on your behalf.
In this instance, Clearspring will use the e-mail addresses to deliver that message.
Clearspring will not share this information with anyone, including CPSC, and the information will be removed automatically from its site after a short period.</li>
<li>Yahoo’s® Flickr Embedded Slide Show (Privacy)</li>
<li>Slideshare Embedded Slide Show (Privacy)</li>
<li>Adobe Flash Player: This tool is in use on SaferProducts.gov to give an individual the option of uploading supporting documents or photos associated with a Report of Harm.
If you upload a file that contains PII, that PII will become available to CPSC staff.
Only authorized CPSC personnel will have access to this information and may utilize it in investigations and other legally-authorized agency activities.
This PII will not be shared outside of the agency, unless you provide explicit consent to share your name and contact information with the manufacturer or private labeler that you identified in your Report.
The CPSC’s secure Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System maintains this PII for an indefinite period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Links Policy
<p>CPSC recognizes that an open Internet policy, with respect to the dissemination of information via its website, is an ideal way to deliver safety information to the widest possible audience.</p>
<p>In accomplishing its safety mission, CPSC also recognizes the importance of the global marketplace and, therefore, does not preclude links from international sites.</p>
Links IN: Other Organizations' Links To CPSC's Website
<p>CPSC welcomes links to any part of its websites from all who wish to do so.
However, no link may present or display a product or activity in a way that states or implies CPSC endorsement.</p>
Links OUT: CPSC's Links To Other Organizations
<p>CPSC's websites have links to other government sites, business websites that are required to post recall information, CPSC pages on social media websites, and nongovernmental websites that support the agency’s mission and that do not contradict CPSC policies or regulations.
CPSC will not consider requests to "out-link" to private, commercial or other non-government websites.</p>
<p>From time to time, CPSC may decide on its own, not based on any request, to out-link to a non-Federal website.
This would be an agency decision made based on two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The link would clearly support the agency's mission of preventing deaths and injuries from consumer products and</li>
<li>It is clearly determined that the link would not contain information that contradicts CPSC policies or regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPSC does not control links to other government or business websites or their privacy policies and cannot attest to the accuracy of the information they contain.
You may wish to review the privacy policies of any external sites linked to via the CPSC site as their information collection practices may differ from ours.
Linking to external sites does not constitute an endorsement of the sites or the information they contain by CPSC or any of its employees.</p>
<p>Such a link may be short- or long-term, at the discretion of the Commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Privacy Policy
<p>We will not collect personal information about any visitor to this site unless it is voluntarily given to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Legal</strong>
<p>All materials on the site are presented by the CPSC for general informational purposes only.
These materials do not, and are not intended to, constitute legal advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Privacy Impact Assessments
<p>CPSC is responsible for ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of the information it collects on members of the public, business partners, and its own employees.
These people have a right to expect CPSC will collect, maintain, use and disseminate identifiable personal information only as authorized by law and as necessary to carry out agency responsibilities.</p>
<p>Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)&nbsp;are performed on computer systems and applications to evaluate any risks these systems may pose to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Personally Identifiable Information
<p>We do not attempt to identify individual users of the website.
If you identify yourself by sending an e-mail to CPSC, filling out a form on a CPSC website or submitting a comment to CPSC, any personal information that you provide is used only to respond to your message.
It will not be disclosed outside of the agency without explicit permission.</p>
<p>If you join one of the CPSC's email subscription lists, your email address will be used for that purpose only and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.
If you submit a report of harm through SaferProducts.gov, via the CPSC Hotline, or by fax or postal mail, the report will be processed and placed on SaferProducts.gov if it meets the&nbsp;minimum requirements for publication.
Your name and contact information will never appear on SaferProducts.gov.
You will be given the option of allowing CPSC to provide your name and contact information to the manufacturer or private labeler that you identified in your report.
By law, we can provide this information to the manufacturer only if you give us written permission to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Systems of Records
<p>The Privacy Act requires agencies to publish in the Federal Register notices of new or substantially altered&nbsp;systems of records, that is, systems from which personal information, confidential or not, is retrieved by personal name or identifier.</p>
<p>CPSC reviews each system of record notice biennially to ensure it accurately describes the system of records.
All systems containing PII are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that holdings are accurate, relevant, timely and complete and necessary for the proper performance of a documented agency function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Security
<p>To ensure the security of the site and to ensure that the service remains available to all users, this government security system employs software programs to monitor network traffic so we can identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>
<p>Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited.
Such attempts may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.</p>
