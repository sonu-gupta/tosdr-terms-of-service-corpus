<li>Why do we use your personal information? Why do we use your personal information? <p>We use your personal information in order to provide and improve our Services, to comply with legal obligations and to advertise our Services and to keep our Services safe and secure.
Please find below how we use your personal information specifically and on what legal grounds we base the use of your personal information.</p> Activities &amp.
purposes <ol>
<li>
<strong>Service</strong>: the most important reason for using your personal information is, of course, to offer you our Services as mentioned in our Terms of Service, for example to create or visualize your Content or share your ideas and to let you access and use your Content across different devices.</li>
<li>
<strong>Support</strong>: we provide a wide range of support services to help you out whenever you’re in need, for instance when you need technical assistance.
If it’s needed to offer support, the Support-team can, on your request, access your Content in order to help you out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Account &amp.
billing</strong>: creating and upholding your personal account for example to facilitate your address book and to enable you to access your Content across different devices, facilitating payment of your subscription fee and perform accounting, auditing &amp.
billing activities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Safety, integrity &amp.
security</strong>: WeTransfer follows up on abuse reports, NTD/DMCA reports, fraud investigations and could investigate your compliance with our of our Terms of Services and/or API Terms of Use.
Furthermore, we detect &amp.
block Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAI).
Detection of CSAI leads to automated decisions whether such Content is potential CSAI.
Cases of potential CSAI will be reported directly to law enforcement agencies.
Furthermore, we protect ourselves against fraud and other illegal activities.
In all these cases we withhold the right to preserve your Content and share it, together with other identifying information, with law enforcement agencies.
Finally, we could use your personal information for internal control to safeguard our and your safety, integrity and security.
For instance, in case of any suspicion of violations of our Terms of Services or the API Terms of Use.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improvement &amp.
development</strong>: we evaluate the use of our Services to improve our Services, fix bugs, develop new products and services.
We do this either by market research (for instance by sending out surveys) or by performing analyses (for example by tracking and bringing together your personal information across our Services or across your mobile devices).
We do this in order to understand how our user base as a whole interacts with our Services, but also to review the effect of our advertisements and to improve those Services and advertisements accordingly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing, advertisement &amp.
communication</strong>: we use your personal information for marketing and (interest based) advertising for instance by using SDKs or cookies, as well as communication.
Think updates on new Services, but also personalised advertisements of WeTransfer or our partners, which we can serve on our or third party websites.
In order to find the right audience for these advertisements we will look at certain segments of people.
For instance, people who use similar Services as ours, people who share the same characteristics as our current users or people within a certain geo-location, such as the Amsterdam area.
In order to connect with our target audience, we might use sequential messaging, which is basically a form of storytelling: each time you interact with our Services on a different device, you may receive a slightly different ad in a different form, but the ads are part of the same story.
Moreover, based on the way you interact with our Services through your devices, we might promote one of our (other) Services or features.
Finally, we enable you to engage in any (personalised) actions, promotions or events we offer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Legal</strong>: in so far as necessary, we might use your personal information to defend WeTransfer in legal proceedings in relation to or as a result of your use of our Services, following a court order, abiding by any law, regulation or governmental request, cooperating with law enforcement, cooperating in fraud investigations of third parties, safeguarding national security, defense, public security, and to uphold our Terms of Services.</li>

<p>
<strong>Personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>WeTransfer retains your personal information as long as its necessary to provide our Services to you (e.g.
upholding your user account), to conduct our business activities and fulfill our legitimate interests, such as providing safe and secure services, to fix bugs and to reach out to you, to comply with applicable laws (e.g.
retaining financial information for 7 years for tax purposes) and legal requests and to resolve (legal) disputes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Files you transfer</strong>
</p>
<p>When using WeTransfer File Sharing your Content will be deleted after 7 days, unless you have a Pro account in which case your transfer data is stored by default for 28 days or until the expiry date you set manually.
After this period, a file is automatically deleted from our servers.
The personal information that accompanies your transfer is kept for a maximum of 12 months.
Such personal information is only accessible to very few people within WeTransfer, those that need it to perform their job, for example to provide you with support.
When data is older than 12 months, we scrub it from the database, pseudonymise or anonymise it for analysis.
Pseudonomising your personal information means that we do not use your email address or IP address for analytical purposes, but create a random pseudonym for both and use that pseudonym instead.
That way we don’t have to handle directly identifiable personal information, which is privacy-friendly.</p>
