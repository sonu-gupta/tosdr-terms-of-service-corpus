Welcome to Keybase
<p>We offer a range of products and services, including this website, mobile and desktop apps for messaging and file sharing, encrypted Git and a cryptocurrency wallet (these Terms and our Privacy Policy will refer to these and all the other services and products we offer as our Services).
These Terms cover your use of our Services, so please read them carefully.</p>
Our Business Model and Approach to Privacy
<p>Our mission is to help you protect your privacy and your data.
Eventually, we plan to offer a paid service for corporate teams, but for now Keybase is free for everyone.
You can read more about our business model and our approach to privacy here.</p>
Note: When you publicly announce some of your account information, you can’t delete or alter it
<p>We use a public blockchain to protect our users from misbehaving servers.
Because of that, you can’t delete your publicly announced account information and account activity once you post it.</p>
Your Content
<p>Our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive both encrypted and unencrypted content.
You retain ownership of your rights in that content.
In other words, if it’s yours, it stays yours.</p>
<p>We only have limited rights to use your content so that we can provide and improve our Services.
In legal terms (sorry, but we have to say it this way): you give us rights to your content to the extent necessary to operate, promote, and improve our Services, and to develop new ones.
We don’t have (and can’t) access your encrypted content and these rights you’re granting us doesn’t change that fact.</p>
Content from Our Users
<p>Much of the content available in the Services isn’t from Keybase.
This content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that makes it available.
To the extent content is unencrypted, we may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law.
But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.</p>
Minimum Age
<p>Our Services are not directed to children, and you may not use our Services if you are under the age of 13.
You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>
Your Promise to Us When You Use Our Services
<p>You agree that you will not misuse the Services.
For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using methods we don’t provide to you.
You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations.
We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies, including our Acceptable Use Policy, or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>

Arbitration
<p>These Arbitration and Class Action Waiver sections includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding).
Please read them carefully.
You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</p>
<p>You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Keybase, you will first contact Keybase and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.</p>
Arbitration Agreement
<p>After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of Keybase’s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Keybase or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration.
This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Keybase.
However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Keybase for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases.
If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below.</p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration.
Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator.
Court review of an arbitration award is limited.
Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
You agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Keybase are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Keybase, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 28th Floor - NY, NY 10004.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used.
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>
<p>The number of arbitrators will be one.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and New York law will apply.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.
However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below.</p>
<p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Keybase and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@keybase.io within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service.</p>
Class Action Waiver
<p>Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”).
The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum.
If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration.
Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</p>
<p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Keybase each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in New York, New York.</p>
Miscellaneous Legal Terms
<p>When we refer to “Keybase” and “we” or “us” we mean Keybase, Inc., a Delaware corporation.</p>
<p>If we need to provide notice to you, we will do so via your Keybase account or the email address we have on file for you.</p>
<p>If a court holds that we cannot enforce a part of these Terms as written, you and we will replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms will remain in effect.
This is the entire contract between you and us regarding the Service.
It supersedes any prior contract or oral or written statements regarding your use of the Service.</p>
<p>You may not assign these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Service.
We may assign our rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>

These Terms are solely for your and our benefit.
It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors.</p>
<p>You must bring any claim related to these Terms or the Service within one year of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a longer time to file claims.
If it isn’t filed in time, the claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p>The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws rules.</p>
<p>The failure of you or Keybase to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of your right or Keybase’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance.
rather, the same will remain in full force and effect.</p>
