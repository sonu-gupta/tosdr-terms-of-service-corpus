         <p>If you use the&nbsp;LFX&nbsp;platform and services, please note that such use is subject to the&nbsp;LFX Platform Use Agreement&nbsp;and the other documents referenced therein, rather than the Terms of Use set forth below.</p>
<p>By using Linux Foundation websites you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t violate anyone’s intellectual property and/or post anyone else’s copyrighted or confidential material you don’t have permission to use.</li>
<li>Don’t post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, etc.</li>
<li>Don’t post spam.</li>
<li>Too many metalinks and tags are not accepted.
If you try to boost your SEO, that’s an abuse of the system.</li>
<li>Don’t post just to sell something.
Sure, talk up your project, but don’t mention how to buy it every single time.</li>
<li>Don’t launch into personal attacks.
You’re not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.</li>
<li>Tone down the foul language.
You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing.
In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.</li>
</ul>

If you don’t agree to these terms, don’t use this website.
Violation of the terms in this document may result in the removal of the content and a warning from the site’s administrators.
