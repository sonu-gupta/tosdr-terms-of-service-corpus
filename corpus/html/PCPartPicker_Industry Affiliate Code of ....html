        
<p>Industry affiliates are authorized representatives from manufacturers, retailers or other companies within the industry.
PCPartPicker welcomes and encourages industry affiliates to interact with our community, including answering product information questions, providing support or general conversation.
However, please be mindful that such interactions will be viewed by the community as representing the affiliated company and should be used in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>An industry affiliate account is subject to the same site posting guidelines and Terms of Use.
Additionally, the following guidelines should be followed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Any account that intends to promote their company or products must make clear their affiliation with the company.
An industry affiliate account is encouraged to request company-specific “flair” to appear next to their account name to help make this more obvious to the community.
This can be requested via the contact page.</li>
<li>Product announcements or advertisements are not allowed.
If you have a new product you would like added to the PCPartPicker database, please reach out directly to our support staff or through our contact page.</li>
<li>Industry affiliates may not recommend their own products or services to users who have not previously expressed interest.
For example, if a user is asking about BRAND X, an industry affiliate of BRAND Y should not engage in trying to convince the user to switch to their product.</li>
</ul>
