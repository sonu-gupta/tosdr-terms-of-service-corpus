COMMERCIAL E-MAIL:
<p>This company will never send an unsolicited e-mail message.
We maintain a very serious position on this matter.
Also, we do not allow the distribution of unsolicited commercial e-mail (sometimes called junk e-mail or spam) by third parties to its members.
If there are attempts to send unsolicited e-mail to anyone in this domain from other accounts in this domain or from over the Internet, it is our policy to take appropriate action to see that such solicitations are not sent though this system again.</p>
<p>It is a violation of our terms of service to send unsolicited advertising and promotional material through our system, or to give a return address of this domain or system.</p>
<p>It is the policy of this company to charge a flat rate fee for message storage &amp.
transmission for any unsolicited commercial mailings of $100.00 per message received.
Bills left unpaid after 30 days will be forwarded to applicable service providers and assessed a 50% late fee.
After 60 days, unpaid bills will be referred to applicable credit reporting and collection agencies.
A second unsolicited commercial e-mail through this domain will also result in action under the terms of applicable U.S.
law, including Title 47, Sec.227(b)(1)(C) of the U.S.
Code, as follows: “It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States to use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.” A “telephone facsimile machine” is defined in Sec.227(a)(2)(B) as: “equipment which has the capacity to transcribe text or images (or both) from an electronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto paper.” Under this definition, an e-mail account, modem, computer and printer together constitute a fax machine.</p>
<p>Our company specifically does not authorize the use of its proprietary computers, servers, routers and computer network (the “network”) to accept, transmit or distribute unsolicited bulk e-mail sent from the Internet to our members.
It is also a violation of policy, and the law, to send or cause to be sent to, or through, the network Internet email that makes use of or contains invalid or forged headers, invalid or non-existent domain names or other means of deceptive addressing.
We consider such email to be counterfeit, and any attempt to send or cause such counterfeit email to be sent to, or through, our network is unauthorized.
Moreover, any email relayed from a third party’s mail servers without the permission of that third party, or any email that hides or obscures, or attempts to hide or obscure, the source of an email also constitutes an unauthorized use of our network.
Email sent or caused to be sent to our network that violates our Terms of Service is also unauthorized.
Nor do we authorize the harvesting or collection of screen or account names from the our network for the purpose of sending unsolicited email.</p>
<p>Our customers may send a single e-mail message to a maximum of 100 recipients in one mailing, not to exceed 500 recipients within a one hour period.
All single e-mails sent to over 100 addressees will not be delivered.
No notice will be given to you in this case.
If you send e-mails to more than 500 recipients within a one hour period, your ability to send ANY e-mail messages is suspended.
We reserve the right to take all legal and technical steps available to prevent unsolicited bulk email or other unauthorized email from entering, utilizing or remaining within our network.
Such action may include, without limitation, the use of filters or other network devices, immediate termination of service, and prosecution of offenders through criminal or civil proceedings.
Nothing in this policy shall be construed to grant any right to transmit or send email to, or through, our network, and in no event shall any failure by us to enforce this policy constitute a waiver of our rights.</p>
<p>Unauthorized use of our network in connection with the transmission of unsolicited bulk email, including the transmission of counterfeit email, may result in civil and criminal penalties against the sender, including those provided by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C.
§ 1030 et seq.).
and various state laws, including the Virginia Computer Crimes Act (Va.
Code Ann.
§ 18.2-152.2 et seq.) (amended effective July 1, 1999.)</p>
<p>VIRTBIZ, in its sole discretion, may terminate service without warning for any customer who is found to send unsolicited commercial email.
In no case shall we be held liable for any loss of income, business interruption, or other damages that may be caused by such termination of service and remain protected by our published Terms of Service (TOS), Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) in addition to the United States of America “Can Spam Act of 2003” which states in part (b) “ISP HELD HARMLESS FOR GOOD FAITH PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT- An ISP is not liable, under any Federal or State civil or criminal law, for any action it takes in good faith to block the transmission or receipt of unsolicited commercial e-mail.”</p>
DATA INTEGRITY/BACKUPS:
<p>
<strong>Shared Hosting</strong>: Our shared hosting servers are backed up on a nightly basis in order to provide continuity for disaster recovery purposes.&nbsp.
As these backups are automated and overwrite previous backups, we cannot guarantee the backup will contain the exact desired content (website files, emails, database records) for every customer.
&nbsp.
To this end, VIRTBIZ offers backup provisions through the hosting control panel (ie: cPanel, BlueOnyx, Plesk) that customers are encouraged to take advantage of.&nbsp.
Backups can be stored on the hosting server itself as well as downloaded for local storage (ie: a “safety copy”).</p>
<p>
<strong>Dedicated Hosting</strong>: VIRTBIZ does not provide any sort of backup solution by default for dedicated or VPS servers.
It is expected that the customer has a working competency with regard to data integrity and it is the customer responsibility to maintain a backup strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp.
VIRTBIZ may be able to offer support for customer backups, both on-site and off-site.&nbsp.
Dedicated hosting customers can contact their account representative for assistance and consultation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Colocation</strong>:&nbsp.
Due to the nature of varied colocation use cases, no backup solution is provided for colocation users.&nbsp.
It is expected that the customer has a working competency with regard to data integrity and it is the customer responsibility to maintain a backup strategy.&nbsp.
IRTBIZ may be able to offer support for customer backups, both on-site and off-site.&nbsp.
Colocation hosting customers can contact their account representative for assistance and consultation.</p>

Additionally, VIRTBIZ shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations due to any cause beyond its reasonable control.&nbsp.
