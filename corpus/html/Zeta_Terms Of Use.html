<p>
<b>SECURITY</b>
</p>
<p>While we use industry-standard precautions to protect confidential information on our systems and provide suitable security, we cannot guarantee that information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions will be free from delay, interruption, interception, or error.
We cannot guarantee or warrant that any part of the website or our apps, including any links to third-party content, are free of viruses or other harmful code.
It is your responsibility to take appropriate precautions, such as through the use of an anti-virus software package, to protect your computer hardware and software.</p>
<p>
<b>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>ACCESS VIA MOBILE DEVICES AND MINIMUM DEVICE REQUIREMENTS</b>
</p>
<p>You may be able to access and browse our website and our mobile apps via its interactive features through a compatible mobile device.
In order to do so, you must have a wireless subscription with a participating carrier or have other network access.
For our mobile apps, your mobile device must also meet certain minimum device requirements.
These requirements can be found on the Apple or Google Play store when you download the mobile apps.
You are solely responsible for all service fees and charges from your carrier or network provider, as well as any necessary equipment or software requirements, associated with accessing our website and any of its interactive features through your mobile device.</p>
<p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.
You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions.
The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Zeta Help Inc.</p>
<p>Zeta is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
<p>The Zeta app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service.
It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Zeta app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Zeta Help Inc.
will not take responsibility for.
Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Zeta Help Inc.
cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.
As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
region or country) without turning off data roaming.
If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, Zeta Help Inc.
cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e.
You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Zeta Help Inc.
cannot accept responsibility.</p>
<p>With respect to Zeta Help Inc.’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
Zeta Help Inc.
accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
</p>
<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app.
The app is currently available on Android &amp.
iOS – the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
Zeta Help Inc.
does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp.
iOS version that you have installed on your device.
However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end.
(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
<p>
</p>

</p>
<p>In order to use Zeta’s services, you must provide and verify your email and cellular phone number (or other text message address) to us, and you must expressly consent to receive text messages or emails relating to the Services at that number or address.
By providing us with a telephone number for a cellular phone or other wireless device, you agree to receive autodialed and pre-recorded, non-marketing, service-related text messages from or on behalf of Zeta at the phone number provided.
You further consent to receiving autodialed and pre-recorded text messages from or on behalf of Zeta at the number provided for marketing or promotional purposes.

After you text “STOP” to us, we will send you a text to confirm that you have been unsubscribed.
After this, you will no longer receive text messages from us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are responsible for any messaging or data fees you may be charged by your wireless carrier for receiving SMS notifications.</p>

</p>
<p>In order to participate in the Referral Program, you must accept and agree to our Terms of Use, including these Referral Terms and our Privacy Policy, and have and maintain a Zeta Account in good standing.</p>
<p>
<b>Earning Referral Rewards.
</b>When you register for a Zeta Account or from time to time thereafter, we will provide you with a hyperlink, text link, badge, button, or other code via email, text message, social media platform, or other format that contains a unique referral ID associated with your Zeta Account (a "Referral Link").
Subject to these Referral Terms, within 30 days of the completion of the Sign-Up Process by each Qualifying Referral using your Referral Link, we will send you the specified referral reward ("Referral Reward"), less any taxes or other amounts that we are required by law to withhold, to your email on file.
Please refer to the Website for the current Referral Reward.
All Referral rewards will be paid in U.S.
Dollars.
For purposes of these Referral Terms, a "Qualifying Referral" means a couple that (a) does not currently have, and has never had, a Zeta Account.
(b) has not initiated the Sign-Up Process prior to clicking on your Referral Link.
and (c) uses your Referral Link to complete the Sign-Up Process, and "Sign-Up Process" means the successful registration for a Zeta Account pursuant to our Terms of Use, including, but not limited to, linking of certain bank account and identification information.
We will determine, in our sole discretion, whether a Qualifying Referral completes the Sign-Up Process using your Referral Link in accordance with these Referral Terms and whether you are eligible to receive a Referral Reward.</p>
<p>
<b>Restrictions and Limitations.</b> We reserve the right to investigate any suspicious or inappropriate activity relating to the Referral Program.
Notwithstanding any provision of these Referral Terms, we are not obligated to pay any Referral Rewards if we determine, in our sole discretion, that (a) the Sign-Up Process completed by a Qualifying Referral is not a bona fide transaction, including, without limitation, if you use a Referral link to register for more than one Zeta Account.
or (b) you have engaged in any fraudulent or deceitful behavior in connection with the Referral Program, including, without limitation, if you, directly or indirectly, offer any person a financial or other incentive to complete the Sign-Up Process using your Referral Link or attempt to redirect traffic from, or divert Referral Rewards from, any other participant in the Referral Program.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to delay payment of any Referral Rewards while we investigate your participation in the Referral Program or any use of your Referral Links.</p>
<p>
<b>Non-Exclusive.</b> The Referral Program is non-exclusive.
You acknowledge and agree that we may, at any time, solicit customer referrals via any method in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>
<b>Termination or Suspension of Referral Program.</b> You may stop participating in the Referral Program at any time by contacting us at support@askzeta.com and providing sufficient information for us to verify your identity.
We may, in our sole discretion, suspend, limit, or terminate the Referral Program and terminate these Referral Terms and Conditions for any reason at any time by providing notice to you (including notice via email at the email address we have for you in our records).
Termination of the Referral Program and these Referral Terms will not automatically result in the termination of our Terms of Use or your Zeta Account, unless otherwise specified by us.
However, termination of our Terms of Use or closure of your Zeta Account will result in the automatic termination of your participation in the Referral Program and termination of these Referral Terms.
Upon termination of these Referral Terms, you must immediately cease all use of Referral Links, and Referral Rewards earned but unpaid as of the date of termination will remain payable, unless we terminate these Referral Terms for your breach of these Referral Terms or our Terms of Use.
Provisions of these Referral Terms that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Referral Terms will survive termination of these Referral Terms.</p>

If you revoke this debit authorization, but you do so less than 3 banking days before the next scheduled debit date, we may nonetheless attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel that scheduled debit transaction.
However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so.</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b>
</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OPERATING OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE WHERE SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM: (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES, OR (ii) ANY PURCHASE OF A THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE BASED ON INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE ZETA SERVICES, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF A COUPON.

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 21 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>INDEMNIFICATION</b>
</p>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Zeta and its Board of Managers, officers, advisors, partners and personnel from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses arising out of or in any way attributable to any breach of these Terms of Use by you.
</p>
<p>
<b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>
</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
You agree that any dispute between you and Zeta arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Governing Law.
</b>Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Agreement and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.</p>
<p>
<b>Informal Dispute Resolution.</b> We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.
Before filing a claim against Zeta, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting support@askzeta.com.
We will try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Zeta may bring a formal proceeding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>We Both Agree To Arbitrate</b>.
You and Zeta agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.</p>
<p>
<b>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</b> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting support@askzeta.com within 30 days of first accepting this Agreement and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>
<b>Arbitration Procedures</b>.
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect.
Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location we agree to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Arbitration Fees.</b> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, Zeta will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</b> Either you or Zeta may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California, or any United States county where you live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>No Class Actions.</b> You may only resolve Disputes with Zeta on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under our agreement.
(i) Judicial Forum for Disputes.
Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Zeta agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California.
Both you and Zeta consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.
We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Limitation on Claims</b>.
Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>GENERAL</b>
</p>
<p>This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Zeta regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may only be amended by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties.
You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.
We may assign this Agreement or any of our rights or obligations under this Agreement at any time without notice.
The failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
In the event that any part of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>
