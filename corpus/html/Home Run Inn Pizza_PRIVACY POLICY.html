<li>

You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

The following exceptions may apply, and we may deny your request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information;</li>
<li>Take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you;</li>
<li>Perform our contract with you;</li>
<li>Detect security incidents or protect against malicious or illegal activity;</li>
<li>Comply with any other relevant California or federal law;</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<u>Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</u>.
You have the right to direct us not to sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt out”).
The law defines “sale” more broadly than you may believe.
“<u>Sale</u>” covers the transfer of Personal Information to any third party in exchange for valuable consumer information.
We do not transfer your information to third parties in exchange for money, but we may transfer Personal Information to third parties to operate our business.
To exercise the right to opt-out, you or your authorized representative may submit a request to us by filling out the California Consumer Privacy Act Opt-Out Form.
Once you make an opt-out request, we are required by law to wait at least 12 months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales, but you may change your mind and opt-in by emailing us.
Customers who opt-in may opt-out of future sales at any time.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some exceptions to opting out.
We can transfer data to a service provider even if you opt out.
A service provider is a business that agrees not to use your information for any purpose other than providing the services specified in our contract, like a business partner that manages our data security.
We can also transfer your information to a third party if it is necessary to process an order or other transaction to which you have agreed and directed us to complete.
Collecting information and using that information ourselves for internal, reasonable business activity is not a sale.
If you opt-out, we may still collect and process your Personal Information for our internal purposes.
Opt-out also applies only to Personal Information.
information that has been anonymized and aggregated is no longer Personal Information and opting out will not limit our ability to transfer this kind of data to third parties.</p>
<p>There are also reasonable technical limitations on opting out.
Where we can reasonably determine that information relates to you, and you submit a verifiable consumer request to opt-out of data sales, we will not “sell” it to third parties.
However, if we are unable to determine that information relates to you, it will not be covered by an opt-out request.</p>
<p>Opting out is not unsubscribing from marketing messages from us.
Please follow the unsubscribe link in any email communications from Home Run Inn to unsubscribe to email communications.</p>

<strong>Your Nevada Privacy Rights</strong>
