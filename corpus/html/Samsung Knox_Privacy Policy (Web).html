<strong>Cookies, Beacons and Similar Technologies</strong>
</p>
<p>We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Business Services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Business Services.</p>
<p>
<em>Cookies</em>
</p>
<p>Cookies are small files that store information on your device.
They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions.
Cookies serve many useful purposes.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.</li>
<li>Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Business Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages.
By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the Business Services and provide you with a better experience.</li>
<li>Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access the MSS Service.</li>
<li>Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Business Services and other websites and apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use a web browser to access the Business Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent.

<p>
<em>Other Local Storage</em>
</p>
<p>We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Business Services.
These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.
However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.

<p>
<em>Beacons</em>
</p>
<p>We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server.
Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device.
We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Business Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
By accessing and using our Business Services, you consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on your devices.
