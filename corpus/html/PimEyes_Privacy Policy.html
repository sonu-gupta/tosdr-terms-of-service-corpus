<strong>data on payments for services:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to provide Users with secure online payments, PimEyes uses the services of an authorized external entity, which is responsible for the sale of the PimEyes service as a so-called merchant of records (more on payment methods for services can be found in the Terms and Conditions of Use).
This entity, indicated for the Site, processes the User's personal data in its own name and for its own purposes - in order to implement the payment process.
The abovementioned entity discloses to PimEyes information about the status of payment, i.e., whether the payment made by the User using the given email address was successful or not, as well as information about the country from which the payment was made.
PimEyes processes this data to register payment for the service and, as a result, to perform the service,</p>

<p>The payment servicing entity also provides PimEyes with User identification data, i.e., name and surname.
The indicated personal data of the User may be processed by PimEyes for establishing, exercising or defending of legal claims and for billing purposes;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>
<strong>data collected in PimEyes' index:</strong>
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>PimEyes, like any Internet search engine, performs a service for the User, using PimEyes’ index.
„Fingerprints” of faces found on the Internet are indexed only for the purpose of further searches.
When searching the Internet for the purpose described above, PimEyes never looks for a specific person, it only indexes pictures available on the Internet and the information about the websites where they were found.
PimEyes does not establish the identity of persons whose photos are indexed (who are hereinafter referred to as "unidentified entities" in this Policy).</p>
<p>PimEyes processes the indexed data for the purposes of creating of an index based on publicly available sources, in order to provide the service in the future.</p>
<p>While presenting the search results PimEyes downloads and displays images from external websites.
This process is done as a secure on-the-fly process commonly known as a proxy.
Images are stored only temporarily and are deleted immediately after being displayed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>data necessary to exercise the Users’ rights related to the processing of personal information:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>PimEyes allows Users to exercise the specific rights related to the processing of personal information like a right to opt-out to have any and all of data removed from the PimEyes system.
The exercise of these specific rights is possible only by providing by the User respectively a photo of the User, an anonymized scan of identification document, an email address, and a telephone number.
The aforementioned data are processed for the purpose of responding to a request, also when the obligation to establish the request procedure results directly from the law provisions (compliance with a legal obligation to which PimEyes is subject) as well as for the purposes connected with establishing, exercising or defending of legal claims.</p> PERSONAL DATA RECEIVED FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN THE DATA SUBJECT <p>In some cases, PimEyes can obtain personal data not directly from the data subject but from another entity, which would be a controller of such data.
It may happen in the cases described above, i.e., when PimEyes receives the contact details of persons acting in the name of or on behalf of the PimEyes’s a client/contractor or potential client/contractor and when PimEyes receives the Users' data from the payment servicing entity.</p>
<p>In the case of data of unidentified entities, processed in the PimEyes’s index referred to in point 4 above, the data comes from publicly available sources.
When collecting such data, PimEyes respects the special rules of each website visited by PimEyesBot web robots and downloads data only from the sites whose robots.txt allows it.</p>
<p>PimEyes displays images from external websites and is not responsible for the content presented on them.
Nonetheless, PimEyes makes every effort to eliminate explicit or pornographic content or have it blurred.</p> VOLUNTARY DATA PROVIDING <p>Providing personal data is voluntary, however if the User does not provide all the required data, it may result in the inability to use PimEyes services.</p>
<p>Before using the service, the User is asked to give his/her consent for processing the given data.
The consent is always voluntary.
PimEyes also allows Users to withdraw their consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
The consent can be withdrawn by sending relevant information using this contact form.</p> DOES PimEyes SHARE PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES? <p>As a rule - PimEyes does not disclose personal data to anyone.
PimEyes entrusts personal data to entities whose services are used in connection with data processing, e.g., IT service providers, accounting services - to the extent necessary for the proper performance of these services.</p>
<p>The service providers PimEyes chooses, guarantee appropriate data security measures.</p>
<p>PimEyes shares the User’s data with third parties in order to perform the service they commissioned us, e.g., to fulfill the User’s order to send by PimEyes a DMCA or GDPR request on the User’s behalf to the website administrator who has been using their photo.</p>
<p>PimEyes may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with PimEyes’ business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.</p> HOW LONG USERS PERSONAL DATA WILL BE STORED? <p>As a rule, personal data will be stored for the duration of the service and after its completion - for the period necessary to establish, exercise or defend of legal claims and for compliance with a legal obligation to which PimEyes is subject (e.g., invoice issue and storage).
However, in some cases, PimEyes may store data for a shorter period:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the case of data processing solely to respond to the User’s question - personal data will be deleted (along with correspondence/email sent via the contact form) within 12 months of the response/last contact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of (and if) data processing based on the consent - data will be processed no longer than until such consent is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Removing data from the User’s account shall mean that the User withdraws their consent to the processing of the data collected there for each purpose for which the consent was given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Face images along with the "fingerprint" of face of unregistered Users are stored for 48 hours from the moment the User sends the photo in order to process the search query.
Data of unidentified entities is stored for 2 years.</p>
</li>

Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about the User’s means of connection to the Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information.</p> WEB BROWSER COOKIES <p>The Site may use "cookies" to enhance the User experience.
User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them.
Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert them when cookies are being sent.
If they do so, some parts of the Site may not function properly.</p> GOOGLE SERVICES <p>The Site uses Google Analytics - a web service that analyzes the website traffic based on information from “cookies”.
After receiving the data, Google prepares for PimEyes reports on activity on the SIte, evaluates the use of the Site by the Users, as well as provides PimEyes with additional services regarding the Site and Internet usage.
Google Analytics helps PimEyes to constantly improve the Site to provide the services that better match User’s expectations and needs.
Each User can disable the Google Analytics service by downloading the Google plugin available here.</p>
<p>PimEyes uses Google’s reCAPTCHA system – an advanced risk analysis engine that enables PimEyes to distinguish between human and automated access to the Site.
The reCAPTCHA system on the User's side usually consists in rewriting letters or numbers or indicating the appropriate images.</p>
<p>More information about Google Analytics and reCAPTCHA, including the processing of User’s data, is available in the Google Privacy Policy and Google Terms of Service, which apply to both Google services.</p> HOW PimEyes USES COLLECTED INFORMATION <p>PimEyes collects and uses User’s non-personal information for the following purposes:</p>

PimEyes has implemented all possible technical measures to block all data that can be reasonably linked with Illinois or Illinois residents (“<strong>Illinois Data</strong>”), both at the stage of collecting data from publicly available sources as well as when provided by the data subjects or from a source other than the data subject.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, any data subject to whom the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“<strong>BIPA</strong>”) applies, is entitled to exercise the opt-out right to have any and all of their data removed from the PimEyes system.

<p>c) a right to request the deletion of Personal information,</p>

The time period to provide the required information may be extended once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, provided the Consumer is provided notice of the extension within the first 45-day period.
A time period for PimEyes to respond to any Verified Consumer Request may be extended by up to 90 additional days where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.
