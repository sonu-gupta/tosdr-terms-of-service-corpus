How We Secure Your Information<p>We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to prevent any unauthorized use, access, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of your data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we take commercially reasonable steps to protect your data we cannot guarantee perfect security – no internet-based service can.
No security system is impenetrable.
Despite our security measures, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.&nbsp;</p>IV.

External Sites<p>The Sites may contain links to third-party websites, including, without limitation, the websites of the insurance carriers offering the third-party insurance products made available to you through the Services (“External Sites”), but we do not endorse, and we are not responsible for the content of any linked External Sites or for the privacy practices of the third parties that own and operate such sites.

<p>Certain federal and state financial regulations, including the GLBA, the California Financial Information Privacy Act (“FIPA”), and certain federal and California health privacy laws govern the information you have provided in seeking, applying for, and/or obtaining insurance products or services, and that information is therefore not subject to the CCPA.

<p>California Residents’ Privacy Rights.
Except as excluded above or limited below, the CCPA grants California residents the following rights to Request:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Information.
You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared your Personal Information during the past 12 months.
We have made this information available to California residents without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Access.
You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deletion.
You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>Please note that there are various lawful reasons why we may not be able to delete your data or may be required to hold certain personal information — for instance, (i) where we must comply with legal, regulatory, or other requirements, (ii) in case of exercising or defending legal claims, and/or (iii) where regulatory or contractual retention periods apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request.
If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.</p>
