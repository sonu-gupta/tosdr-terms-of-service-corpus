</ul>Terms of use<p>Patreon is a membership platform that enables creators to be paid by their fans.
One of our core behaviors is to put creators first, and these terms attempt to do that.
We know that most people skim through terms of use because they're boring, but we have done everything we can to make this easy to get through.
Above every section we’ll summarize the most important parts, but these summaries are not legally binding, so please look at the full version of the text if you have questions.</p>

<p>
</p>All about being a creatorTo summarize: A creator is someone who creates a membership page on Patreon to engage with patrons who have purchased memberships from Patreon to support the creator’s creations.
There are a lot of details below involving payments, fees, taxes and restrictions that you should read in full if you are a creator.<p>
</p>
<p>Membership</p>
<p>To become a creator, simply launch your page to start your membership.
When you join Patreon, you become part of the Patreon community.
You can use creator tools that Patreon provides, showcase your creations, provide merchandise to patrons through Patreon’s Merch service, and receive recurring revenue from your page.
Memberships are for your most passionate fans.
On Patreon, you can provide your patrons something exciting that gives them unique benefits they want, like additional access, merchandise, exclusivity, and engaging experiences.
In turn, you will receive loyal support from your patrons, and recurring revenue from memberships that patrons have purchased from Patreon.</p>
<p>Payments</p>
<p>As a creator you make your membership available on Patreon, and we provide membership to your patrons on a subscription basis.
We also handle payments issues such as fraud, chargebacks and resolution of payments disputes.</p>
<p>We try to provide timely access to your funds, but you may occasionally experience delays in accessing your funds.
We may also block or hold payments for violations of our policies or for compliance reasons, including collecting tax reporting information.
When payments are delayed or blocked we try to communicate the reason to you promptly.
If you have questions about a payments block, please reach out to us.
In order to protect creators, we may block patrons’ payments if we believe them to be fraudulent.</p>
<p>Sometimes activities like refunds can put your account balance into the negative.
If your balance becomes negative then we reserve the right to recover those funds from future payments.</p>
<p>Fees</p>
<p>As a creator there are two fees associated with your membership on Patreon.
The first is the platform fee, which varies depending on the level of service you select.
The second is the payment processing fee, which is dependent on the currency selected by the creator.</p>
<ul>
<li>The payment processing fee in US Dollars is 2.9% plus $0.30 per successful pledge for pledges over $3, and 5% fee plus $0.10 per successful pledge for pledges of $3 or less.PayPal payments from non-US patrons have an additional 1% fee.
Founding creators have a legacy platform fee and the legacy payment processing rate.
The legacy payment processing rate varies depending on a number of factors, including the membership subscription amount, card type and number of other memberships joined by a patron.</li>
<li>The payment processing fee in Euro is 3.4% plus €0.35 per successful pledge for pledges over €3, and 5% fee plus €0.15 per successful pledge for pledges of €3 or less.</li>
<li>The payment processing fee in British Pounds is 3.4% plus £0.35 per successful pledge for pledges over £3, and 5% fee plus £0.15 per successful pledge for pledges of £3 or less.</li>
</ul>You can see how much processing fees are for any membership subscription on your creator dashboard.<p>
</p>
<p>Depending on your patrons’ locations, some banks may charge your patron a foreign transaction fee for their membership subscription.
Patreon does not control this charge, but it is typically around 3.0% .</p>
<p>Tax</p>
<p>We collect tax identification information and report this to tax authorities as legally required.
You are responsible for reporting any income or withholding taxes which may be due as a result of payments received.
You can learn more in our Tax Help Center.</p>
<p>We are additionally responsible for a number of transactional taxes across the world.
These include but are not limited to VAT on payments for electronically supplied services to patrons in the EU, GST as an operator of an electronic distribution platform (EDP) within Australia, and state sales tax as a result of ‘marketplace laws’ within the United States.
For the purpose of electronically-supplied services, creators make a supply of those services to us, and then we supply them to the patron.
To learn more about how we handle transaction taxes, please check our VAT guide.</p>
<p>In locales where Patreon is required to collect transaction tax from patrons, pledges processed from patrons will reflect the tier or custom pledge amount plus the applicable tax.
Applicable tax will not be taken from a pledge, but rather will be charged in addition to the pledge.
Once settled, the tax amount will be automatically deducted for remittance to the applicable taxing authority.
A record of the transaction tax portion of the pledge will be available on your earnings details page.</p>
<p>As a creator on our site, it is your responsibility to provide accurate information when you are engaging with the sales tax weighting tool and, generally, when listing benefits transferred within your tiers.
</p>
<p>Restrictions</p>
<p>We don’t allow creations and benefits that violate our policies.
You can learn more by visiting our Community Guidelines and Benefit Guidelines.
A summary of those rules is that we don’t allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illegal creations or benefits.</li>
<li>Creations or benefits that are abusive towards other people.</li>
<li>Creations or benefits that use others' intellectual property, unless you have written permission to use it, or your use is protected by fair use.</li>
<li>Creations or benefits with real people engaging in sexual acts.</li>
<li>Benefits that involve raffles or prizes based on chance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>If your fans include people under the age of 18, then please remind them that they need permission to join your membership, and those under the age of 13 cannot use Patreon.
We are not required to allow any particular person or group of persons to be your patron.</p>
<p>As a creator you are also responsible for keeping patron data safe.
You can see what is required in our Data Processing Agreement.</p>
<p>An account is tied to your creative output and cannot be sold or transferred for use by another creator.</p>
<p>
</p>All about being a patronTo summarize: A patron is someone who purchases memberships from Patreon to support their favorite creators’ creations.
Through a paid membership on Patreon, patrons directly interact with creators they support, using tools supplied by Patreon, and through our platform have the opportunity to engage with a greater community of patrons and creators.<p>
</p>
<p>As a patron, you’re joining Patreon to be part of an exciting movement to support a creator’s membership while you get special benefits, like access to your creator, merchandise (when offered), exclusivity, and engaging experiences with the creator and patron community.
In exchange, you pay Patreon for membership programs, on a subscription basis, to access and support creators you like.
To become a patron, simply create an account, add your preferred payment method, and join a membership program on Patreon to start supporting your creator!</p>
<p>There are three types of membership subscriptions.
One is a monthly subscription where you pay per month.
The second is a per creation subscription where you pay based on the number of creations a creator posts in that month.
You can set a limit on the number of creations you pay for in a single month under the per subscription model.
The third membership option is an annual membership, where you pay for a year of access up front, at a discounted rate.
Not all offerings allow for all three subscription types.
Your options will be presented to you in the payment flow.</p>
<p>The timing and amount of each membership subscription depends on the type of membership agreement you enter into, and the creator you support.
You can see the details as you join, as well as in the receipt sent to you after each successful payment.
You can view all your active membership subscriptions and billing history on your membership page.</p>
<p>You may cancel your membership payments at any time.
Annual memberships may be cancelled, or increased, but not lowered.
Terminating or lowering the tier support of membership will go into effect in the subsequent (not current) payment term, except for annual memberships which can be terminated or increased but not lowered.
Increasing your payment to a higher tier level in an annual membership will go into effect in the current payment term.
When you increase your payment for an annual membership during the term, you will get a credit for any payment already made in that term.</p>
<p>For monthly or per creation payments, canceling your support may result in your loss of access to a creator’s patron-only posts and benefits.</p>
<p>These include when you cancel your membership subscription, your payment method fails, the creator blocks you, or the creator deletes their account.
We are not required to allow you to be a patron of any particular creator.</p>
<p>Creators’ memberships vary and we have limited control over the quality and specific offerings.
We attempt to screen for fraudulent creator pages, but cannot guarantee the identity of creators or the validity of any claims they make.
We appreciate your help reporting suspicious creator pages so we can keep Patreon safe.</p>
<p>If you are located in the jurisdiction in which Patreon is required to charge and collect tax (e.g.
VAT or, sales tax), then this tax is added to the total charge.
Except in limited circumstances, this tax is shown when you set up the initial membership subscription.
Patreon remits all tax collected to the applicable taxing authority.
As tax is largely dependant on your location, you are responsible for keeping your address complete and up to date.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, some banks may charge you a foreign transaction fee for your membership subscription.
Patreon does not control this charge, but it is typically around 3% .
Please contact your bank for more information.</p>
<p>
<b>Refunds</b>.
Our policy is No Refunds, though we will allow for some exceptions where refunds are granted in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>
</p>Patreon’s roleTo summarize: We proactively look at some pages and posts on Patreon and review reported pages to identify potential violations of our guidelines.<p>
</p>
<p>We proactively look at some pages and posts on Patreon to make sure creators follow our Community Guidelines and Benefit Guidelines.
We also investigate reports of potential violations.
These investigations may take a while to resolve and may include looking at what is supported by funds received through Patreon.</p>
<p>In most situations we will work with creators to resolve any potential violations and allow the creator to continue using Patreon.
Terminating accounts is not an action we take lightly and is done in only the most extreme cases.</p>
<p>Patreon reserves the right to remove a creator or patron from participating in annual memberships.
Removal of the creator or patron from participation in annual memberships will prohibit the creator from accepting new annual payments, and prohibit the patron from making new annual payments, but will not result in an automatic removal of the creator or patron from the platform, unless there is an independent basis for their removal from the platform.</p>

You can learn how to report them here.</p>

We can also cancel any membership subscriptions and remove any descriptions, posts or benefits at our discretion.</p>
