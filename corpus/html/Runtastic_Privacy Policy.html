<u>Sharing of personal data with other users.</u> The use of certain features of our Products includes the sharing of personal data with other users.
These features would not work without such data sharing, i.e.
it is necessary to fulfill our user agreement with you.
Using the following features includes sharing of personal data with, i.e.
making personal data visible to other users:<br>Your Runtastic profile and Followers - We distinguish between “private profiles” and “public profiles” where all profiles are private by default and only become public on your request.
As long as your profile is a “private profile”, other users will see your name, your profile picture, your background image, your biography text, your country of residence and the common followers you have with the user visiting your profile.
Moreover, all users will see the number of Followers you have and the amount of people you follow.<br>
</li> When your profile is a “private profile”, other users can send you a request to become your Followers.
Once you accept this request, all information, which according to your privacy settings, you share with Followers, will become visible for those users, your Followers.
<br> Once you make your profile a “public profile”, your profile is fully visible to all other users of our Products by default unless for certain data, like GPS maps for example, you determine otherwise in the privacy settings.
This means by making your profile a public profile, all privacy settings are set to “everybody” and all other Runtastic users can access your AR info, activity records and details, statistics and the connections you have without even following you.
In case you don’t want to have certain data publicly available, you need to change the corresponding privacy setting accordingly.
In any case other users, except blocked users, might follow a public profile without a need to request.
<br>News Feed - Our Products allow viewing and sharing information, including through posts, likes, and comments in the so-called News Feed.
Certain actions, such as tracking an activity, starting a training plan or upgrading to Premium Membership, will be automatically posted in the News Feed.
By default setting, only you and your Followers will be able to see such information in their News Feed.
You can modify the visibility anytime in your privacy settings.<br>Leaderboard - If you track an activity, you will automatically join a weekly/monthly Leaderboard of accumulated distance, or duration among the people you follow.
This means, once you are followed by someone, you will be part of their Leaderboard.
You can opt out of this at any time in your privacy settings.<br>Challenges - We offer participation in competitions with a specific goal in a defined timeframe (“Challenges”).
There are different challenges available for registered users to join, potentially with the possibility to win prices.
You can compare your ranking/success with all users who are part of the same challenge.
First name, last name, profile picture and activity information (e.g.
total distance, total duration) are visible to all participating users.<br>Groups and Communities - Every user can join and create groups and can invite other users to these groups.
Users can also be invited to communities.
Within a group or community, you can interact with other members and compare your rankings.
First name, last name, profile picture and activity information (e.g.
total distance, total duration) are visible to all users within a specific group or community you joined.<br>LIVE Tracking - The Products include a "LIVE Tracking" feature, which enables your Followers in our Products to see the activity information, including heart rates, of your current sports activity.
LIVE Tracking can either be completely activated or completely deactivated.
LIVE Tracking is deactivated by default and can be activated at your own discretion.
Once activated, it stays activated for new activities, unless you turn it off again.
By activating the feature, you accept the responsibility for such activation at your own risk.
If you do not want to give other people access to your current position/localization, LIVE Tracking should not be activated.<br>

<u>Your Rights.</u> Pursuant CCPA, California consumers have the right to request access to the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them in the last 12 months.
You may also request additional details about our processing practices, including the categories of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources of such collection, the business or commercial purpose for collecting personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we share your personal information and the categories of personal information we have disclosed about you in the preceding 12 months.
This corresponds with the <strong>Right to Information and Access</strong> as listed in the Privacy Policy and can be enforced accordingly.
<br>

This corresponds with the <strong>Right to Erasure</strong> as listed in the Privacy Policy and can be enforced accordingly.
<br> Moreover, you have the right to opt out of sales of personal information and to receive equal service and price and not be discriminated against even if you exercise any of your CCPA rights.

drawing or cartoon).
