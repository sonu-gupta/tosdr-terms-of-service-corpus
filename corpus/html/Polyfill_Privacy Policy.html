<p> This Site and the Service are referred to together as “<em>Polyfill.io</em>”.
</p>
<p> We collect and use information in different ways for the Site and the Service.
This Privacy Policy sets out details of these different ways in which we collect and use information.
</p> What information do we collect from the Service? # <p> The Service is a hosted instance of software known as Polyfill Service.
Polyfill Service provides snippets of code, called “polyfills”, that allows websites operated by FT and by others to provide a consistent experience across different browsers.
When you load a web page which uses Polyfill Service, your browser will download any polyfills required in order to present the web page successfully in your browser.
</p>
<p>In order to provide the polyfills, the Service receives from your browser certain technical information including:</p>
<ul>
<li>browser details;</li>
<li>connection details (such as your IP address which can identify your approximate location and/or name of your ISP).
</li>
<li>the URL of the web page which has made the request to the Service.
</li>
</ul>
<p> We use that information to determine which polyfills are required by your browser.
We then retain only the following information: </p>
<ul>
<li>the domain of the web page which has made the request to the Service;</li>
<li>the user agent string for your browser;</li>
<li>the set of polyfills that were requested by the web page.</li>
</ul>
