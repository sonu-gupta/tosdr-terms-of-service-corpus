<p>The list below describes briefly the content of the web site and how you use the content or the web site as a whole.
This list is not all-inclusive and may change with the changes being reflected on this page.</p>
<ul>
<li>The content of the web site is developed for the RGB space.
This means color representation is primarily in hexadecimal and RGB codes.</li>
<li>How the color appears on your computer screen depends on several factors including, but not limited to, screen brightness, contrast ratio, gamma settings, light source/s in the surrounding environment etc.</li>
<li>CMYK color values/codes on the web site are auto-calculated from the hexadecimal (or RGB) value/code using well-known formulae.
These CMYK values may differ from the actual CMYK codes/values used in printing processes and technologies.</li>
<li>Color codes, values and names used by color systems and companies such as Pantone®, RAL etc., unless stated otherwise, are closest translations of the hexadecimal and RGB codes.</li>
<li>Colors developed by paint companies do not translate well to the RGB space.
Please check the color cards/fan decks of those companies for the actual interpretation of the color.</li>
<li>Color names used on the web site may not be the correct interpretations of the color.
Colors and color schemes are subjective.</li>
