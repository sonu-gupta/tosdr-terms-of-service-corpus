<strong>IV.
VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL ITEMS</strong>
</p>
<p>While using the Services, you may have the opportunity to visit online and in-game stores where you can obtain and use Nexon’s virtual currency and digital, in-game items (including early access to games still in production, as may be offered from time to time).
Nexon also may make points available to you in connection with your use of the Services.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL CONTENTS, INCLUDING VIRTUAL CONTENTS EXCHANGED FOR PREPAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS, ARE REGARDED AS GOODS OR SERVICES, AND ARE NOT PREPAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS.
Virtual currency and points have no “real-world” value but may be exchanged for in-game items.
Items from such stores are not purchased by you, but rather are licensed to you under these Terms.
REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY, YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE ITEMS OBTAINED WITH VIRTUAL CURRENCY.</p>
<p>Any prices, quotations and descriptions made or referred to on our Services do not constitute an offer and may be withdrawn or revised at any time before Nexon’s express acceptance of your order.
To the extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to pay all charges, fees, and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone else using your account or resulting from use of the Services on your device at the price(s) in effect when such charges occurred.
Nexon may change the pricing for the Services at any time consistent with applicable law.
Nexon reserves the right to notify you of any mistakes in product descriptions or errors in pricing prior to product dispatch.
If that happens, and you choose to continue with fulfilment of the order, you acknowledge that the product or service will be provided in accordance with such revised description or corrected price.</p>
<p>Different payment methods, such as credit card, direct debit, PayPal, Karma Koin, etc., may be available to you when obtaining virtual currency through the Services.
When you use third-party payment and billing providers, such as PayPal, that provider’s additional terms, conditions, and costs, apply.
It is your obligation to pay all federal, state, and local taxes associated with the receipt or use of the virtual items which you purchase from Nexon.</p>
<p>Certain minimums may apply to purchases of virtual currency, and certain maximums may apply depending on your transaction method.
Nexon reserves the right to change the maximum and minimum amounts applicable to virtual currency purchases at any time without notice, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEXON WILL NOT OFFER REFUNDS FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR DIGITAL, IN-GAME ITEMS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT, THESE TERMS, OR THE SERVICES, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
FOR RESIDENTS OF THE EEA OR OF THE UNITED KINGDOM ONLY: YOU AGREE TO IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE THE DIGITAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VIRTUAL CURRENCY, DIGITAL IN-GAME ITEMS AND ANY OTHER VIRTUAL CONTENTS, AND TO WAIVE YOUR CANCELLATION AND REFUND RIGHT ONCE THE DOWNLOAD OR STREAMING OF THE DIGITAL PRODUCT HAS BEGUN.
If an account is permanently banned, all content licenses and virtual currency balances associated with the suspended account are forfeited.
Nexon will have no obligation or responsibility to and will not reimburse you for any virtual currency, points, items, or experience lost due to your violation of these Terms.</p>
<p>Items may expire.
Each item that you obtain using virtual currency or points will be included in your account until the earlier of the item’s expiration date, termination or expiration of your account, these Terms, or the Services.
Price and availability of items are subject to change without notice, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your account if for any reason a charge you authorize us to make to your credit card or SMS/phone billing cannot be processed or is returned to us unpaid or refunded and, if such event occurs, you shall immediately remit to us payment for such charge through the use of another credit card or other payment mechanism.
We are not responsible or liable for any credit card or bank-related charges or fees related to any of your transactions.
We reserve the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any item or to refuse to provide you with any item.
You may be required to verify your transaction information prior to our acceptance thereof.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these Terms, the laws in your country may apply to the purchase of virtual goods and services supplied by Nexon to you and you may have rights or remedies as set out in such laws that apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in these Terms.</p>
<p>As for the Services provided in Japan, only virtual contents or in-game items that are shown as Prepaid Payment Instruments on the websites titled “Representation in accordance with the Payment Services Act in Japan” or “Prepaid Payment Instruments” shall be deemed as “Prepaid Payment Instruments” under the Payment Services Act in Japan.
All other virtual contents or in-game items to be exchanged for by such “Prepaid Payment Instruments” are considered to be goods or services delivered in the game and are not considered as “Prepaid Payment Instruments” under the Payment Services Act.
Unless otherwise provided for under the said Act, any “Prepaid Payment Instruments” shall not be refunded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.

No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p>
<p>Arbitration Procedures.
Any arbitration will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (“JAMS”) under the applicable Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the Dispute is filed.
If JAMS is unavailable or unable to conduct an arbitration of the Dispute, an alternative arbitration service provider will be mutually agreed upon by both parties.
You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS rules.
In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p>
<p>Arbitrator’s Jurisdiction.
The arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.</p>
<p>Arbitration Fees.
Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee.
If we file, we pay.
If you file, you pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules.
All other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law.
Each party will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</p>
<p>Location of Arbitration.
You agree that the arbitration will occur in the following location:</p>

<p>Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year.
To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in small claims court or in an arbitration proceeding.
The one-year period begins when the Dispute or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.
If a Dispute isn’t filed within one year, it’s permanently barred.</p>
<p>Temporary Injunctive Relief.
Before the appointment of an arbitrator, either party may seek temporary injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without waiving its right to arbitration.</p>
<p>If this agreement to arbitrate is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the parties agree to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law that any Dispute relating to your use of the Services or these Terms shall be commenced and heard in accordance with Section IX.</p>
