<br>
</p> What is CNOT? <p>CNOT is an educational resource on quantum computing.</p>
<br> The aims of this website are to: <ul>
<li>Guide the user through relevant topics in a sensible order</li>
<li>Be a reference for the necessary background and prerequisite material</li>
<li>Be an additional resource for learning about quantum computing</li>
<li>Give the user the knowledge to read and understand material beyond the scope of this website</li>
</ul>
<br> Why? <p>Quantum Computing has only really been around since the ‘80s, but it already promises efficient solutions to many of the problems conventional computers struggle with.
</p>
<p>While quantum computing requires a decent background in maths, a lot of theoretical quantum computing ideas should be accessible to anyone doing an undergraduate mathematics, physics or computing course.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, quantum physics is quite unintuitive, and quantum computing is very interdisciplinary which can create hurdles when a new student tries to tackle it.
For example, a computer scientist is unlikely to have come across Dirac notation, which most quantum computing literature uses, and a physicist is unlikely to have learnt about the different classes of computing problems that quantum computing is so useful at solving.
</p>
<p> The main purpose of this website is to guide a new learner through the main topics in a sensible order, and to provide a reference for all the relevant background &amp.
prerequisite material needed to understand modern quantum computing literature.
The idea is that a student can use this website to decide “what to learn next”, and refer back to this website if they come across something they are unfamiliar with.
