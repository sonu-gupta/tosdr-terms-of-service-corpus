<p>We may share your Personal Information in the following situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Sharing Lists:</b> Our Services allow you to share your lists with other users of the Services, and send your lists by email, SMS, or other messaging system.
Please be aware that any Personal Information you include in such lists will be made available to the recipients that you choose.
You do so at your own risk.
Even if you subsequently remove this information from our Services, the recipients may have stored or copied this information.</li>
<li>
<b>Service Providers:</b> We contract with other companies and individuals to perform certain services on our behalf.
To the extent these third parties have a legitimate need to access your Personal Information in order to complete their work, we will ensure they are contractually obligated to use this information only for the contracted work and for no other purpose.</li>
<li>
<b>Business Transfers:</b> Information essential to our Services, including your Personal Information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, or similar event in which your Personal Information is transferred to one or more third parties as part of our business assets.</li>
<li>
<b>Investigations:</b> We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that doing so is legally required, or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Services and other users of our Services.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, we may provide non-personally identifiable information (i.e.
<em>not</em> your Personal Information) relating to your location, items on your lists, your interactions with our Services, your mobile device and other identifiers, mobile device model, IP address, etc.
to our third party advertising partners (for example, Google, Apple, Yahoo!) in order to (i) retrieve and display targeted advertisements to you in connection with your use of our Services, and (ii) analyze the information for commercial purposes.</p> How We Protect Your Information <p>We use various security measures to help protect your information from accidental loss, disclosure, and misuse.
These measures include review of our system logs, off-site backups, data encryption, and security software.
However, no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective.
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect.
You transmit information and use our Services at your own risk.</p> Where Your Information Is Stored <p>Our servers are located, and your information is stored, in the United States of America.
If you choose to use our Services from outside the U.S.A., then please be aware that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of your country and into the U.S.A.
for storage and processing.
By providing your Personal Information to us through your use of our Services, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S.A.
You should be aware that the privacy and data security laws of the U.S.A.
may in some cases provide fewer protections than those of your own country.</p> General Data Protection Regulation <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation intended to protect the data and privacy of individuals in the European Union.
We process your “personal data” as defined by the GDPR (i.e., data that can be traced back to you as an individual), and we are therefore required to justify why we are lawfully permitted to process this data.
Simply put, we collect and process the data that you give us (your email address, your shopping lists, your recipes) in order to provide you with a multi-user shopping list app.
Doing so is the core purpose of our Services.
We therefore have a “legitimate interest” (as defined by the GDPR) in processing this data (see Article&nbsp;6, paragraph&nbsp;1(f)).
We do not process personal data that is incidental to the Services (such as your demographic data).
Please feel free to contact us if you have questions about our GDPR compliance.</p> Changes To This Privacy Policy <p>If we make a material change to this privacy policy, we will notify you by email or within the OurGroceries apps so that you may review the new terms and decide whether to continue using the Services.
We encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and share information.</p> Contacting Us <p>If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy, please contact us at privacy@ourgroceries.com.</p>
