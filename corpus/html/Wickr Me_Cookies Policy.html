<strong>Why We Use Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>As a privacy-focused company, Wickr has built and operated its platform as a ‘zero-knowledge’ system to ensure that our users have full control and ownership of their communications.
This means that Wickr as a company is built private-by-design from its very start to provide secure its communications service, and does not collect or monetize your content.</p>
<p>Your trust is important to us and we tirelessly work on improving our services and raising awareness about our products, which are designed to ensure our users’ security and privacy.
To accomplish these goals, we use cookies that enable us to learn how our website visitors navigate our content and how web users interact with our marketing materials so we can understand how to improve our website and our content so we can continue building privacy and collaboration-enhancing features accessible to all users.
We may also use cookies to recommend content that might interest you based on your past interactions with us.
We make every reasonable effort to: a) minimize the information we collect to operate the service, b) limit the amount of time we keep it and c) enable our users to proactively minimize the data they store on their devices to ensure its privacy and security.</p>

Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.
Pixel tags, which are small blocks of code installed in or on a webpage, also provide us with insight about our users’ preferences.
