<li>
<strong>Unlimited Voice and Data Plans.</strong>Your Mint Mobile Service is provided by Mint Mobile, LLC, including its affiliates, assigns and agents (“Mint Mobile,” “we,” “us” or “our”).
Mint Mobile reserves the right to periodically review usage levels of unlimited minute and unlimited data Mint Mobile Service plans (“Unlimited Plans”) to ensure that you are not using an Unlimited Plan in violation of this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) and if such an abuse or violation is discovered to terminate or adjust the plan as appropriate.
You agree to use the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan for traditional voice calls between two individuals of a duration comparable to that of the average individual customer presently utilizing a Mint Mobile Unlimited Plan and will not employ methods, devices or procedures to take advantage of your Unlimited Plan by using the plan excessively or for means not intended by Mint Mobile.
Excessive use of the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan is defined by Mint Mobile as use that materially exceeds the average call volume or duration used by all other Mint Mobile customers that have purchased an Unlimited Plan.
Mint Mobile may terminate your Service or change your Service plan if, in its sole discretion, Mint Mobile determines that your use of the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan violates this prohibition or is otherwise “unreasonable” or results in abuse of the Unlimited Plan.</li>
<li>
<strong>International Long Distance Service.</strong>If you have purchased an Unlimited Plan, Mint Mobile may limit the number of unique international phone numbers your phone will be allowed to call to 20 unique international phone numbers per 30-day Service term.
based on the international destinations covered by your plan.
In such event, the 20 unique international numbers count will automatically reset when your next 30-day Service term begins, unless you purchase a new Unlimited Plan prior to the start of your next Service term.
Please visit the Mint Mobile website to learn more about the specific features and offerings of our international plans.
All international long distance services included in our Service plans are handled by PLD, LLC (“PLD”) and are delineated on your invoices separately from the services provided by Mint Mobile.
PLD is not affiliated with Mint Mobile.</li>
