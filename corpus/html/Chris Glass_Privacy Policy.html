<strong>I do not store or collect your personal data.
</strong>
</p>
<p>In fact, I don’t even use analytics.
That said, the server inherently has logs of traffic on this site, I guess.
But I don’t look at those logs or even know where to find them.
</p>
<p>The less I know about such things, the more time I can focus on how my friends and family are doing, make sure my cat is happy, and figure out what’s for dinner.</p>
<p>The only information I receive is if you leave a comment or a send a note through my contact page.</p>
<p>I do not do any tracking, but I have been known to embed videos on posts.
I’m trying to strip those out.
So if you see video that you can play on a page and feel like letting me know, please do! I will turn it into an explicit link so folks can make the choice.</p>
