<em>This Privacy Policy was last updated: November, 24, 2020</em>
</p> INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION <p>IdenTrust is a Certification Authority (a CA) that is recognized and relied upon by the major browser manufacturers to issue Digital Certificates (also known as PKI certificates and X.509 certificates).
These certificates are used by individuals to authenticate their identity to others, and/or to encrypt sensitive data including financial transactions so they can be transferred over the Internet.
Digital Certificates are also used by computers to encrypt data exchanged between web hosts and Internet users.</p>
<p>As a CA, when IdenTrust issues a Digital Certificate, others are assured that the certificate holder is who he or she claims to be, and that information encrypted by the certificate is safe from outside viewing or intrusion.</p>
<p>Whenever an individual provides information about himself or herself to apply for a Digital Certificate, this information is called “Personal Information” and the person is called a “Data Subject.”</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that IdenTrust processes from Digital Certificate applicants and holders and describes how IdenTrust collects and uses Personal Data.
It also describes how IdenTrust gathers, processes, and protects it.
It also describes your rights to obtain a copy of the Personal Information we have about you, and other rights that will be described later.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> In addition to issuing Digital Certificates directly to individuals under certain US government programs, IdenTrust processes certificate data for other institutions such as banks.
If you obtain a Digital Certificate through a bank or other organization, that organization’s policies for handling Personal Information are in force, and you should contact that organization with any questions.</p>
<p>If you apply for a Digital Certificate directly through the IdenTrust website, then the following IdenTrust Privacy Policy provisions apply.</p>
<p>
