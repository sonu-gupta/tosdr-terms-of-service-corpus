- Privacy Statement
Last Updated: January 8, 2021 Introduction
<p>Your privacy is very important to Align Technology, Inc.
and its affiliates (“Align”, "we", "us" and "our").
This Privacy Statement explains how we collect, protect, use and share your Personal Information (i.e., information that identifies, relates to, or could be reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular identified or identifiable natural person or household).</p>
<p>Align designs, manufacturers and markets the Invisalign<sup>®</sup> system and iTero<sup>®</sup> intra-oral scanners and OrthoCAD services and the My Invisalign app, which enables users to track and share progress whilst undergoing Invisalign treatment by uploading images, sharing stories, creating appointment reminders and receiving notifications (the "App").
