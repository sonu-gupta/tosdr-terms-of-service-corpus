<strong>Personal Information That We Collect</strong>

By using our Services, you consent to the terms of this privacy policy.
We also may provide in-time notice or obtain consent for certain practices.
For example, we may obtain consent using standard permissions available on your device that apply to the Mentor App.</p>
<p>eDriving only collects your personal information if you have provided your consent in your capacity as a private individual using one or more of eDriving’s Services, or in your capacity as an employee of a company who is providing you access to one or more of eDriving’s Services:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Location, travel and route information: </strong>When you are on a driving trip, the App gathers location and route information in the form of GPS signals.&nbsp.
This is NOT shared with your organization.</li>
<li>
<strong>Phone usage and activity: </strong>The App measures general phone activity, including when the screen is on, texting, phone calls and phone movement.
The App does NOT record any individually identifying usage or activity information, such as key strokes, content of phone calls, contacts, photographs (unless uploaded by the driver) or which other applications are running.</li>

<p>
<strong>My Work Team Circles</strong>
</p>
<p>If your organization has opted to use Mentor My Work Team Circles, your immediate team will see your 7-day rolling FICO Safe Driving Score and summary of events (shown only as red, amber, green – not the number of events).&nbsp.
The circle automatically includes all team members, as directed by the Data Controller.&nbsp.
If you wish to stop sharing summary information with your colleagues, you can set this by going to ‘Edit’ at the top right of the screen and switch sharing to ‘off’.&nbsp.
Thereafter, only your manager will see your scores.</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy protection reminder for shift-based drivers </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>The Mentor DSP/DDP app only records driver activity after the driver selects “Begin Route” at the beginning of their shift and until they select “End Route” after the Post Trip DVCR at the end of their shift.
The app does NOT record data, including driving activities and location, at any other time.</li>
<li>If you FORGET to complete your Post-trip DVCR at the end of your route, you will be automatically logged out of the Mentor DSP/DDP app at midnight, which will automatically end any on-going trip scoring – until then, you could be scored while driving off duty!</li>
