         Copyright Policy <p>This policy describes how we at Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc., the company behind meta.discourse.org, respond to claims that materials user have submitted to our service infringe copyright.
In short, we follow the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA.</p> What’s the DMCA? <p>The DMCA is a United States federal law that sets up a formal process for reports of copyright infringement by our users, called takedown notices.
It also sets up a process for disputing takedown notices by sending counter notices.
The law protects us from liability for infringement by our users when we follow these steps.
It also makes those who abuse the takedown and dispute processes liable for damage they cause.</p> How does it work? <p>Many online service providers like us handle great numbers of takedown notices and counter notices.
Often, the whole process takes place online, with the help of automated tools.
However, the legal claims and documents involved remain very serious.
Please approach the process accordingly.</p> Should I send a takedown notice? <p>If you aren’t absolutely sure both that you own copyright, and that material on our site infringes, speak to an attorney before sending a DMCA takedown notice.
Knowing, material misrepresentations about infringement in a takedown notice can make you liable to us, the person that you allege is infringing, copyright owners, and licensees, all for significant damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees.
A lawyer can help you decide if you should file a takedown notice, and if so, help you prepare it correctly.
We can’t.</p> How do I send a takedown notice? <p>Send takedown notices to our agent.
