<p>In some countries we prompt parents to sign in to YouTube Kids with their Google Account to create a profile for their child, enable additional parental controls, customization preferences for their child and use their YouTube Premium membership in the app.
If a parent chooses not to sign in with their Google Account, the app can be used in a signed out state, as described above.</p>
<p>If you sign in to YouTube Kids with your Google Account, the app will collect your Google Account information, such as email address and password, and, as applicable, will collect profile information for any profiles you create for your child as well as your parental controls and &nbsp;customization preferences.
The profile information will include your child’s name or nickname, their age, and their month of birth if you choose to provide it.
The app will collect customization preferences such as videos blocked from the app, videos you may allow in the app, and channels to which they may subscribe.
The app also collects the child’s app activity data including watch and search history specific to each child, as described above.</p>

You can pause the collection of watch and search history or clear the watch and search history in the parental settings section of the app.
When you create a profile for your child, you can pause and clear watch and search history for each child profile.
While history is paused, the app will not use new video views or search terms to recommend content.
&nbsp;When watch and search history are cleared, the app resets Recommended and Watch it again videos.
Finally, you can always uninstall and reinstall the app on a device to reset the app-specific identifiers used to collect watch and search history, but if you have enabled profiles, watch and search history will remain linked to each profile until you specifically delete the history.</p>
