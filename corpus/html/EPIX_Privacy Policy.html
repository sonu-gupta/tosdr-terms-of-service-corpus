Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.The Applications and/or third parties may use “cookies”, “web beacons”, Flash local shared objects and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Other Information automatically as you browse and use the Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services.
“Cookies” are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences, and/or user activity.
“Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses.
Flash local shared objects (“LSOs”) (sometimes known as Flash cookies) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Applications (such as your visits to the Application’s webpages or Application, type of browser used, device type and model, system language, Wi-Fi status, device motion parameters, carrier, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications, or interactive services.
Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on these Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform, and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Applications (“Identifier”).
For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple.
Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your User ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by Network or third parties.3.2.1.

We may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.
We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in Section 4.2 “Other Information Collected By Us” under “How Is Collected Information Used” below.
For example, we use Tracking Technologies to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Applications by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing, and other content, and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.3.2.2.

These Applications may also use third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third parties (collectively, “Third Party Service Providers”) to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (“Customized Advertising”) and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Applications, assist in our marketing and advertising to other users or potential users, and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Applications.
Customized Advertising enables us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services you have visited.Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see “Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers” section below and “More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies” section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and interactive services when you use the Applications.Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Applications, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Applications in order for the Applications to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Applications, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Applications.

Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies that are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.See the “More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies” section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Applications and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.Please note that if you exercise the opt-out above, that only applies to the use of the data for Customized Advertising and we may still use the data for other purposes described in Section 4.2 “How is Collected Information Used” above, such as for video playhead tracking and to optimize your video experience.5.2.3.
More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies.
With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options:5.2.3.1.
More Information About Cookie Controls.
For the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer 11</li>
<li>Chrome</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
</ul>If your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:<ul>
<li>Delete existing browser cookies through the “Internet Options”, “Settings”, Preferences”, “Options”, or similar menu selection in your browser’s menu or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.</li>
<li>Disable browser cookies through the same browser controls, which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted.
Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature.
(See the “help” section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices.</li>
<li>If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.</li>
<li>Choose to have the Device you use to access the Applications warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set.
(You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Applications.
Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.</li>
<li>Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser’s support features.</li>
</ul>The above options may cover browser cookies set by the Applications, browser cookies not set by the Applications (sometimes called third party cookies), and/or both types of browser cookies.Many tools discussed above are “Internet browser cookie based”.
This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.
For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser, after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to reestablish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described above, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.The tools are “Internet browser and Device-specific” or “Device-specific”.
Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices and platforms.5.2.3.2.
Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.
Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications, or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.
For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.5.2.3.3.
You will still receive advertisements.
Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers’, Advertisers’ or the Applications’ Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.
If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Applications and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Applications to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the “Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” section.5.2.3.4.
Limitations Regarding Web Beacons.
Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.5.2.3.5.
How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies).
Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.

Mobile Platforms.
Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers, or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based.
We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.5.2.3.8.
