<small>Last Updated: Feb 23, 2021</small>
</p>
<p>Fellow Insights, Inc.
(“Fellow”) takes your privacy very seriously.
We have created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to outline how we collect, use and disclose Personal Data from Users of our website and web-application (the “Platform”), located at <b>https://fellow.app</b> (“Site”) and our Slack and MS Teams Bots (the “Bots”) and the related services described in our Terms of Use (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
<p>Please review the following text to understand our protocol with regards to Personal Data and how we treat it.
By visiting <b>https://fellow.app</b> or installing our Bot, you are providing your acceptance and consent to practices outlined here.</p>
Background Information
<p>When we refer to “Users”, we are referring to both individual users (“Individual Users”) and Organizational users that hold an Account on the Site or have installed our Bots.
The Services allow Users the opportunity to track and take notes on 1:1s and other meetings, exchange feedback, track goals/priorities and other items as they relate to working together.
In the event that an Organization purchases a subscription to the Services, they will have access to aggregate reporting relating to usage of the Services by Users and other related analytics associated with their Organization.
By default, Organizations will not have access to the content of Notes or Feedback Messages of Users who create this content.
If an Organization’s policies require access to this data, then Fellow will comply.
It is your responsibility to read and understand your Organization’s internal privacy policies.</p>
Definitions
<p>Terms utilized in this Privacy Policy have meanings as defined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Notes” refers to any content written in relation to interactions that Users have with other Users (whether in a 1:1 or group setting).</li>
<li>“Feedback Messages” include the related messages that are exchanged by Users in the process of requesting or giving feedback.</li>
<li>“Organization” refers to the entity that entered into a subscription agreement with Fellow and that you provided to us when you created an Account with Fellow (or that we otherwise retrieve during the signup process).
The Organization will generally be your employer, or a subsection of your employer (i.e.
department).</li>
<li>“Personal Data” means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession), and any information about the individual associated with that information.</li>
<li>“Work Network” is the group of employees, contractors or other authorized Users at your Organization.</li>

</p>
Children under 13
<p>Fellow does not knowingly offer its Services to children who are under 13 years of age.
If we become aware of usage of its services by individuals in this age group, we will attempt to delete all related information immediately.

</p>
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance
<p>For residents of the European Economic Area, Fellow generally processes Personal Data in order to fulfill contracts we have with the Organizations that are our customers and Users, as well as to pursue our legitimate business interests as set out in this Privacy Policy.
Otherwise, Fellow will obtain consent from an Individual User in respect of processing of Personal Data.</p>
<p>When we process data on behalf of Organizations under an agreement with that Organization, Fellow is acting as the “data processor” and the Organization is the “data controller”.</p>
<p>Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) have certain data protection rights under applicable laws (including under the GDPR), including the right to request access to, obtain, correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your personal data.
Individual Users who wish to exercise these rights, should contact Fellow using the contact information.
In circumstances where Fellow is a data processor and the Organization is the data controller, Individuals may be required to contact the Organization to avail themselves of such rights.</p>
<p>Information collected from Users will be processed by us and some of our affiliate services and service providers (“Sub-Processors”).
A list of our current Sub-Processors is available <b>here</b>.
We will take reasonably necessary steps, including contractual measures and other legal requirements, to ensure that your Personal Data is dealt with the same level of caution and care as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Data transferred from the European Economic Area to Fellow or a Sub-Processor shall be in accordance with approved international transfer mechanisms under applicable law.</p>
Security
<p>We take security seriously and use appropriate technical measures corresponding to the types of Personal Data we store, and the risks associated with processing such data.
In the event of a data breach we will contact those affected as well as any applicable regulators as required by law.
You can learn more about Fellow’s security and compliance practices <b>here</b>.&nbsp;</p>
Types of Data We Collect
<p>When using our Services, we collect information from you – some of which is considered “Personal Data” and can be used to identify you, and some of which is “Anonymous Data” which is not linked to any identifiable individual.
In the following sections, we will outline the details of what we collect and how:</p>
Information You Provide
<p>When you sign up, we create an account for you on our servers (“Account”) to access our Services.
We will store information such as your first name, last name, job title, department and email address.</p>
<p>Fellow’s primary objective is to help you manage your work relationships through the logging of discussions, feedback, goals/priorities and more with others that you work with (whether individually or in groups).
Fellow also offers smart suggestions on what actions you may want to take in order to optimize these relationships (for example, “you should ask for feedback from someone in particular”).
In order to provide such suggestions, we need to compute a “work-graph” that will give us insights into the people that you work with and how often you work with them.
In order to offer these Services, we require access to the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slack (applicable if you or your organization have installed our Slack bot): Information about the users in your Slack account and the individuals you interact with most often.
In particular, if Slack is connected: Slack Avatars, Slack Team Names, Slack Channel Membership, Communications within the @Fellow bot and metadata derived from such communications and OAuth&nbsp.
Tokens.
We do NOT request access to the content of your direct messages (“DMs”) or the content of your private channels.</li>
<li>Microsoft Teams (applicable if you or your organization have installed our MS Teams bot): Information about the users in your Teams account and the individuals you interact with most often.
In particular, if Microsoft Teams is connected: Avatars, Team Names, Team Memberships, Communications within the @Fellow bot and metadata derived from such communications and OAuth Tokens.
We do NOT request access to the content of your chat messages (“DMs”) or the content of your private channels.</li>
<li>Calendar (applicable if you connect your calendar): We access data about the events that you participate in such as organizer, title, attendees and optional attendees (names and emails), date, time, duration, calendar resources (meeting rooms) and recurrence of events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you sign up, we may ask you more information including your job title, department, who your manager is and whether you have a 1on1 with this manager and which calendar event this corresponds to.
We also provide the opportunity for you to invite other individuals into the platform so that you may collaborate with them (in order to invite others, we may ask you for some further information about those Users including their name, email address and reporting relationship with you).</p>
<p>The main interactions with Fellow will be both through our Bots and on our Platform.
Users on the system will be able to collaborate on notes in relation to 1:1 and group meetings, goals/priorities and request feedback from one another and provide feedback to each other.
The content created by these Users will be stored and accessible through the Services.
This information is by default only accessible to Users who were part of the interactions and is not accessible by managers of the company (unless those that were part of the feedback interactions explicitly share such feedback with others such as managers).
Metadata about the interactions (such as stats on usage) will be available to managers.
The only exception to this rule will be if the policies of the Organization require us to share this information upon request from the Organization.</p>
Information Collected through Systems
Servers
<p>Our servers (hosted by Amazon Web Services) collect information including the type of browser and O/S you use, your IP Address, domain name and the timing / duration of your visit to our Site.
This information is collected to make our Services more useful to you.</p>
Logs
<p>We record some information from your interactions with our Services automatically in our logs.
This data includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
This information is used to analyze trends and usage patterns all in an effort to better tailor our Services to your needs.</p>
Cookies
<p>Fellow and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track Users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience.
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server.
Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page.
For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or register for the Services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Fellow Services when you visit.
Fellow keeps track of the pages you visit within Fellow, in order to determine what portion of the Fellow Services is the most popular or most used.
This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the Fellow Services to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
Pixel Tags
<p>We use “Clear Gifs” also known as “Pixel Tags” similar to cookies to track the usage of our Services by Users.
These “Clear Gifs” are effectively transparent images that allow us to glean some information about said usage.
An example common use case is to use this technology to understand the open-rate of emails that we send to you.
Ultimately, like cookies, we use this tool as another method to customize our offerings for our customers.</p>
Analytics Software and Advertising Platforms
<p>We use some analytics services from third party vendors such as Google Analytics in order to analyze usage of our Services.
These services utilize information that they retrieve from cookies on our Web Application or other information that we send them directly to provide us with aggregated analytics that we can use to perform our analysis.
These analytics services will have their own privacy policies and terms of use.
By using our Services, you are agreeing to the processing of this data by such analytics services.</p>
<p>We participate in network advertising programs that display advertising about our services on other unaffiliated websites.
We use third party social media platforms (e.g.
Facebook, Linkedin, etc.) to show you customized social media ads and interest-based ads.</p>
Information Collected from Others
<p>By connecting to Slack and Calendar as mentioned earlier in this document, we will be able to determine who works with whom with your organization so as to offer you smart suggestions on how to improve your working relationships with people in your network.</p>
<p>Our MS Teams bot is enabled by the Microsoft Bot Framework.
The Microsoft Bot Framework is a set of web-services that enable intelligent services and connections using conversation channels you authorize.
As a service provider, Microsoft will transmit content you provide to our bot/service in order to enable the service.
For more information about Microsoft privacy policies please see their privacy statement here: <b>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839</b>.
In addition, your interactions with this bot/service are also subject to the conversational channel’s applicable terms of use, privacy and data collection policies.
To report abuse when using a bot that uses the Microsoft Bot Framework to Microsoft, please visit the Microsoft Bot Framework website at https://www.botframework.com and use the “Report Abuse” link in the menu to contact Microsoft.</p>
Information Collected from Your Organization
<p>If your Organization becomes a customer of ours, we will create accounts for your usage of our Services.
We may obtain from your Organization information about you such as your name, email address, title, department and reporting relationships.</p>
Prospective Customers
<p>We collect names, email addresses and other business contact information about individuals who represent our customers as well as individuals who we consider to be prospective customers and business partners (“Prospects”).
We use the information to contact Prospects with information about Fellow products and services.</p>
