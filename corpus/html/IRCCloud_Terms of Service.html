Fees <p>The fees for the Paid Service are available at irccloud.com/pricing&nbsp;(the
“Fees”).</p>
<p>On signing up to the Paid Service, you sign up with our payment
provider&nbsp;and you will pay us the Fees in advance of each payment cycle starting

rights and remedies available to us we may, without responsibility to you,
suspend or temporarily disable all or part of your access to the Service and we
shall be under no obligation to provide any or all of the Service while the
Fees concerned remain unpaid.</p>
<p>All amounts and Fees stated or referred to
in these Terms of Service:</p>
<ul>
<li>are payable in the currency you select;</li>
<li>are exclusive of value added tax (if applicable) unless otherwise expressly
stated which shall be paid at the same time as payment of the Fees.</li>

increase, you may cancel or downgrade your Account.</p> 11.

reasonable endeavours to provide a level of support that is appropriate to the
nature of any issues requiring support during normal business hours (UK
time).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet and technology,
the Service is (save as provided above) provided on an “as
available” and “as is” basis.
This means that we are unable to promise that
your use of the Service will be uninterrupted, without delays, error-free or
meet your expectations and we do not give any commitment relating to the
performance or availability of the Service in these Terms of Service and, to
the extent we are able to do so, we exclude any commitments that may be implied
by law.</p>

Service, our responsibility to you will never be more than the amount you have
paid us for the use of the Service in the 12 months prior to the claim
arising.</p>
<p>In every case, we will never be responsible for any loss or
damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.</p> 12.
Canceling your Account <p>If you fail to pay any sum due to us and such sum remains outstanding for a
further fourteen (14) days following notice requiring such sum to be paid we
may cancel or downgrade your Account immediately by notice and without
responsibility to you.</p>
<p>Either we or
you may cancel your Account where either of us breaches this Terms of Service
in a serious way.</p>
<p>On cancellation for
any reason all licences granted shall immediately end and your right to access
and use the Service will end</p> 13.

Capitalised terms

elsewhere in these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>We are your Processor in respect of Personal Data in communications which you
make using the Service, and you instruct us to Process the Personal Data for the
purpose of providing the Service.
This clause 13 applies in respect of such

<ul>
<li>Process the Personal Data in accordance with all applicable data
protection laws and regulations;</li>
<li>Process the Personal Data only in accordance with your documented
instructions;</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>respect the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 28 for
any engagement of any third parties who Process Personal Data in the course of

engagement.
Subject to clause 11, we shall be liable for the acts and omissions
of our sub-processors, and we shall ensure that the sub-processor contract (as

authorised to Process the Personal Data have committed themselves to
confidentiality;</li>
<li>take all measures required pursuant to Article 32;</li>

Regulation;</li>
<li>provide you, at your cost and on written request, with reasonable assistance
in ensuring compliance with your obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36,
taking into account the nature of Processing and the information available to
us;</li>
<li>at your choice, delete or return all the Personal Data to you after the end
of the provision of the Services, and delete existing copies unless Union or
Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data;</li>

<li>notify you without undue delay if we become aware of a Personal Data
Breach.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may transfer, publish, disclose, divulge or otherwise permit access to
Personal Data by recipients (including sub-processors) in jurisdictions outside
of the European Economic Area.
Where the third country in question is not the
subject of an adequacy decision, we shall comply with Article 46 in respect of
this Processing.</p> 14.
Resolving disputes
<p>If you have a dispute with us relating to the Service, in the first instance
please contact us at team@irccloud.com&nbsp;and we will attempt to resolve the
dispute informally.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that IRCCloud has not been
able to resolve a dispute informally, we will discuss and agree with you the
most effective way of resolving our dispute.</p> 15.
Changes to the Service
<p>We are constantly updating and improving the Service to try and find ways to
provide you with new and innovative features and services.
Improvements and
updates are also made to reflect changing technologies, tastes, behaviours and
the way people use the Internet and the Service.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we
may need to update, reset, stop offering and/or supporting a particular part of
the Service, or feature relating to the Service (“changes to the Service”).
These changes to the Service may affect features that you use.</p>
<p>You agree
that a key characteristic of the Service is that changes to the Service will
take place over time and this is an important basis on which we grant you
access to the Service.
Once we have made changes to the Service, your continued
use of the Service will show that you have accepted any changes to the Service.
You are always free to stop using the Service or cancel or downgrade your
Account in the settings feature of the Service.</p>
<p>We will try, where
possible and reasonable, to contact you to let you know about any significant
changes to the Service.</p> 16.
Changes to the documents
<p>We may revise these Terms of Service from time to time but the most current
version will always be at: irccloud.com/terms</p>
<p>Your continued use of
the Service after these Terms of Service has been amended will be considered as
your acceptance of the amended Terms of Service.
We will notify you of any
material changes to these Terms of Service and give you at least 30 days
notice.</p> 17.
Documents that apply to our relationship with you
<p>The current version of the Terms of Service contains the only terms and
conditions that apply to our relationship with you.
Older versions of the Terms
of Service will no longer apply to our relationship and will be completely
replaced by the current version.</p>
<p>We intend to rely on these Terms of
Service as setting out the written terms of our agreement with you for the
provision of the Service.
If part of the Terms of Service cannot be enforced
then the remainder of the Terms of Service will still apply to our
relationship.</p>
<p>If you do not comply with these Terms of Service and we do
not take action immediately, this does not mean we have given up any right we
have and we may still take action in the future.</p> 18.
Law
<p>As we are based in England, English law will apply to all disputes and the
interpretation of these Terms of Service.
The English courts will have
non-exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising from or related to your use
of the Service although this does not affect any rights you have as a
consumer.</p> 19.
Contact, feedback and complaints <p>If you need to contact us in relation to these Terms of Service or any other
document mentioned in them, please email us at team@irccloud.com.</p>
<p>We value hearing from our users, and are always interested in learning about ways
we can improve the Service.
By providing your feedback you agree that you are
giving up any rights you have in your feedback so that we may use and allow
others to use it without any restriction and without any payment to you.</p>
