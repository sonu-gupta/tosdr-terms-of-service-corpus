<strong>What lawful bases do we rely on for processing?</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to process your personal data, we must have a lawful reason for doing so.
GDPR sets out six lawful bases under which organisations can collect, use and store personal data.
We rely on four of the lawful bases:</p>
<p>Necessary for the performance of a contract<br>
If you are our customer, for example a subscriber of a magazine or an attendee at one of our events, we will process your personal data on the basis that it is necessary for us to provide our products and services to you.</p>
<p>Consent<br>
In some instances we rely on your specific consent to process your personal information.
This is where you have actively agreed and ‘opted-in’, for example to receive marketing communications from us, and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
<p>Compliance with laws<br>
We may have to process and share your personal data in order to comply with our legal obligations, or to protect our rights or the rights of others.
For example, we are required to collect certain information from you when processing your subscription payment for tax or financial reporting reasons.</p>
<p>Legitimate interests<br>
In some situations we rely on our legitimate business interests in order to collect and use your personal data.
In these situations, we have conducted a balancing test to carefully consider the impact of the processing on your interests, rights and freedoms.
We will only undertake the processing if we are satisfied there is no negative impact on you.
We rely on Legitimate Interests for the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing, maintaining, improving and developing our products and services;</li>
<li>sending direct marketing communications about our products and services to customers;</li>
<li>sending marketing communications related to the products and services of carefully selected companies in a business-to-business context;</li>
<li>managing suppression and unsubscribe requests;</li>
<li>
<p>researching publicly available business contact details;</p>
</li>
<li>managing certain aspects of our events;</li>
<li>analysing the use of our products and services;</li>
<li>using analytics to identify usage trends and determining the effectiveness of campaigns;</li>
<li>allowing you to comment on on our sites;</li>
<li>dealing with queries and complaints;</li>
<li>personalising your experience on our sites;</li>
<li>identifying fraudulent behaviour and ensuring our websites and systems are secure.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you object to our reliance on Legitimate Interests for any purpose please contact our DPO.</p>

We are not responsible for the privacy policy or practices of any such third party.

Your personal data may be transferred to a country outside the EEA if, for example, a supplier or service is based outside the EEA.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely, including ensuring the location has been granted ‘adequacy status’ by the European Commission, or using our agreement with the supplier contains model contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, or ensuring the company we are transferring the data to is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>

<p>
<strong>Security</strong>
</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting the personal data we hold.
In accordance with GDPR, we adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to help prevent unauthorised access to your information and ensure data is held securely.
We also require any third parties to whom we may transfer personal data to have appropriate security measures in place.
We ask third parties to complete Data Security Questionnaires so we can be sure they are a safe place for your data.</p>
<p>
<strong>Protecting children’s privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>Our products and services are for a general audience and not aimed at children.
However, we recognise that some of our publications, for example in our Knowledge and Gaming portfolios, may appeal to a younger audience.
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of sixteen or send any marketing communications to children.
If we are running a competition which might be of interest to children, our competition rules specify that a parent or guardian must consent to entry.
If, in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children in connection with our products and services, we will do so in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations including, without limitation, obtaining parental consent where necessary.
The Internet offers children wonderful educational and entertainment resources.
Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience.
We encourage you to visit https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/safetycenter/families/start/ for more information about keeping your family safe online.
If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned that we may be processing personal data related to your child, please contact our DPO.</p>

We must then do so unless we believe we have a legitimate overriding reason to continue processing your personal data.</p>
<p>Direct marketing<br>
You have the right to stop the use of your personal data for direct marketing activity through all channels, or selected channels.

If you wish to exercise any of your rights please contact the Data Protection Officer:<br>
By post: Future Publishing Limited, Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.
or<br>
By email: DPO@futurenet.com.</p>

If you have authorised a third party to submit a request on your behalf, we will ask them to prove they have your permission to act.
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
If this is case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>No fee usually required<br>
You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the rights), however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
If we choose not to action your request we will explain to you the reasons for our refusal.</p>

<strong>Important Information for California Residents</strong>
</p>
<p>This section applies only to California residents.&nbsp.
It describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.&nbsp.
For purposes of this section, “<b>Personal Information</b>” has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<b>CCPA</b>”) but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Your California privacy rights.
</b>
<br>
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.
However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Information.</b>&nbsp.
You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:
<ul>
<li>The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</li>
<li>Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.</li>
<li>Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Access</b>.&nbsp.
You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<b>Deletion.&nbsp.
</b>You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</li>
<li>
<b>Opt-out of sales</b>.&nbsp.
If we sell your Personal Information, you can opt-out.
In addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
We share your Personal Information with third parties in the following circumstances, which California law classifies as a “sale” of your Personal Information:
<ul>
<li>supplying your data to third parties with your express consent (e.g.
where you opt in to receive third party marketing or where you have requested to be contacted by a third party);</li>
<li>supplying your data to list brokers (but only where you have consented to be contacted by third parties);</li>
<li>&nbsp;supplying attendee data to third parties who provide services in connection with our events, and sending your data to suppliers of certain products and services (where you have consented to hear from such third parties);&nbsp;</li>
<li>like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads, content and services to you.&nbsp.
California law classifies our use of these services as a “sale” of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services.
This is because we allow them to collect information from our website users (e.g., online identifiers and browsing activity) so they can help serve ads, content and services&nbsp.
more likely to interest you.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Opt-in.&nbsp.
</b>If we know that you are younger than 16 years old, we will ask for your permission (or if you are younger than 13 years old, your parent’s or guardian’s permission) to sell your Personal Information before we do so.</li>
<li>
<b>Nondiscrimination.</b>&nbsp.
You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.
This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you services.
increasing the price/rate of services.
decreasing service quality.
or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>How to exercise your right to information, access, deletion or your right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information</b>
<br>
You may exercise your California privacy rights by submitting a request form or emailing dpo@futurenet.com quoting ‘California Privacy Rights’ in the subject header.</p>
<p>We will need to confirm your identity and California residency to process your requests to exercise your information, access or deletion rights.&nbsp.
We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.<br>
