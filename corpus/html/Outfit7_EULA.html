(f) all arbitration submissions, communications, and proceedings shall be made or conducted in English.
and (g) with the exception of clause (d) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the AAA Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.</p>

(b) the arbitration shall be held in London, England, or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by You and Outfit7.
(c) the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the ICC Rules of Arbitration and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.
(d) all arbitration submissions, communications, and proceedings shall be made or conducted in English.
and (e) if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the ICC Rules of Arbitration, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.</p>
