<p>Initial Dispute Resolution.
We are available by email at support@unroll.me to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Service, these Terms of Service or our relationship with each other.
Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.
Each of you and us agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
<p>Agreement to Binding Arbitration.
If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the initial dispute resolution process above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.
All disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, including, without limitation, the relationship between you and any of our agents or employees, and/or your use of the Service, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense.
The parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms of Service shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures.
If you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S.
Dollars ($250.00), we will pay the additional cost.
If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.
We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration, other than costs incurred by you for legal counsel, travel and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses not constituting fees or amounts payable to JAMS.
You will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration.</p>
<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
<p>Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver.
You and us each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in our respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and us each expressly waive our respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the agreement to binding arbitration set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>Exception - Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Exception – California Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) Action.
Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a court of law for a claim arising under California’s Private Attorneys General Act.</p>
<p>30 Day Right to Opt-Out.You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the “Agreement to Binding Arbitration” and “Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver” provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at support@unroll.me.
The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections.
If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</p>
<p>Exclusive Venue for Litigation.
To the extent that the “Agreement to Binding Arbitration” provision does not apply or if you have opted out of arbitration, the parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in New York County, New York (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside).
The parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in New York County, New York for any litigation other than small claims court actions.</p>Waiver and Severability<p>No waiver of these Terms of Service by the Company shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.</p>Entire Agreement<p>The Terms constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Unroll.Me with respect to the Service and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Service.</p>Your Comments and Concerns<p>This Service is operated by Unroll.Me Inc.</p>
