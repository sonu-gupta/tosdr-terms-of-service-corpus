We will only use your personal data for our purposes in a manner permitted by relevant data protection legislation, which may include:</p>

<p>By “legitimate interests”, we mean our interests in managing the Website and our relationship with you.
We will make sure that we take into account any potential impact that such use may have on you.
Our legitimate interests will not automatically override your interests and we won’t use your information if we feel that your interests override ours (unless, of course, you provide your consent or we have a contractual or legal obligation to use your information in that way).

<p>
<b>How else will we use your information?</b>
</p>
<p>We may also use your information (including personal data) for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to help us make the Website and other related content available to you (please see the "Will we share your information with anyone else?" section below for more information);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to make the Website more relevant for you and our other visitors.
This includes sometimes requesting personal data from you to help us run and develop our site and associated functions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to send you our newsletter if you have signed up to receive it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to carry out occasional surveys to analyse our user base, ultimately we want to ensure that the Website provides everything that you, our audience is looking for;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to check whether you are eligible for a competition and to contact you if you win;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to comply with the law.
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as we feel is necessary to prevent illegal activity or to protect our interests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>How long do we keep hold of the information?</b>
</p>
<p>There are certain reasons that we have to keep hold of some of your information (including personal data).
We will only keep your information for as long as we need it.
How long we keep it depends very much on the type of information we are holding and the purpose for which we need it (as well as complying with our legal obligations).
For example if you have registered to receive the newsletter, we will keep your information while you are a subscriber to the newsletter so that we are able to provide that service to you, and then delete it after you have unsubscribed.</p>
<p>You can request that we delete your personal data at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>Will we share your information with anyone else?</b>
</p>
<p>We may share your information only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we are required to do so to comply with a contractual obligation or legal requirement or with the directions of the courts or other authorities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we feel it is reasonably necessary to prevent illegal activity or to protect our interests;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we feel that other Virgin entities’ products and services may interest you.
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it helps our trusted third party service providers to provide and improve our service to you or to carry out surveys and user analysis to understand your needs and preferences.
If you subscribe to the Virgin.com newsletter via Virgin.com Limited, we will also share your information with its newsletter supplier,<i>
</i>Mailchimp<i>
</i>who securely host emails and act as a supplier to distribute that newsletter.
Mailchimp will provide this service for Virgin.com Limited.
If you subscribe to the Virgin.com newsletter via Virgin Red (as described in 'What information do we collect if you sign up for our newsletter?' above), <b>Sendgrid</b> will provide those hosting and distribution services for Virgin Red Limited.
We contractually require these service providers to keep your personal data safe and secure.
These trusted third parties would only be permitted to use your personal data for the purposes we specify.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share some broader statistics and customer profiling information with third parties and other Virgin entities - but we'll keep it anonymous, so you won't be identifiable from that data.</p>
<p>We will never rent or sell our users’ details to any other organisation or individual.</p>
<p>
<b>How will we make sure our site is secure?</b>
</p>
<p>We follow strict security procedures to manage how your personal data is stored and used, and who sees it, and to help stop any unauthorised person getting hold of it.
All personal data you register with the Website will be located behind a firewall.
We take security extremely seriously but as no system is 100% secure, we can't completely guarantee the protection of your personal data, any more than any other organisation can.
So we can't accept any liability for the loss, theft or misuse of the personal data which you've registered on the Website if there is a security breach.
</p>
<p>
<b>Will we transfer any personal data outside the UK and/or the EU?</b>
</p>
<p>Countries outside the UK and the European Union (EU) may have a lower standard of protection for personal data than that required by UK and EU data protection laws.
The information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored, outside the UK an/or the EU (including for example in the United States) and may also be processed by people operating outside the UK and/or the EU who work for us or one of our suppliers.
If we need to transfer your data to a company based outside the UK and/or EU (e.g.
if our hosting company is based in the US), we'll take steps to make sure your personal data is handled in line with applicable laws.
If you would like any more details on this please get in contact with us (using the details set out in the “Talk to us” section below).</p>
