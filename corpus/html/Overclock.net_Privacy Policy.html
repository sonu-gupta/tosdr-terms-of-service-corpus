This information may be used to determine how many visitors visit our Site or certain areas of our Site, how long they remain on our Site, whether they use the hyperlinks we provide or respond to advertising and to tailor our advertisements to you.
We may share this information with partners who referred you to our Site, and with advertising partners, who may use the information to optimize the traffic they send to us and for delivering targeted ads to you when you visit other websites.</p>
<p>We, our service providers and third-party advertising partners collect information about Site visitors using cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels and Adobe Flash).
We use these technologies to remember your preferences and facilitate your navigation of our Site.
We and our service providers and third-party advertising partners also use these technologies to track your activities on our Site and other websites, including the websites and web pages that you visited, the ads or content that you clicked on, any items you may have purchased and the search terms you used, in order to deliver tailored advertising to you.
We may also share a unique identifier linked to you (such as a hashed or encrypted version of your email address or telephone number) with advertising partners so that you may be served with tailored advertising on our websites or other third party websites.

<p>Most modern web browsers provide the option to send a “do not track” signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
At this time, there is no generally accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.
Our third party partners, such as web analytics companies and third party ad networks, collect information about your online activities over time and across the Sites and other online properties.
These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to “do not track” settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor “do not track” settings.</p> 4.

For example, if you provide us with your contact information, such as an e-mail address, for the purposes of signing up for information, newsletters, contests, or marketing offers from a third party, or for receiving business offers or service quotes from a third party, we may share your personal information for that purpose.
Once shared, your personal information will be subject to the privacy policy of that third party.</p> Business Transactions <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with the proposed or actual financing, securitization, insuring, merger, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of VerticalScope Inc.
or our business or assets.
These third parties may use the information for the purposes of evaluating and/or completing the proposed transaction and thereafter as a successor of our interests.</p> Other <p>We may disclose your personal information in other circumstances where permitted or required by law or other legal process.

<p>We maintain personal information on our servers (or those of our service providers).
Certain accounts you create on our Sites are password protected.
If you create an account on the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any activity that occurs using your account credentials, whether or not you authorized such activity.
Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.
