<p>3.3 In these terms, references to “log in details” or “account” include your log in details and account for any social network or platform that you may allow our Services to interact with.</p>
<p>3.4 We will be entitled to assume that anyone logging into your account using your log in details is either you or someone logging in with your permission.
If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result.</p>
<p>3.5 We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorised person accessing your account and/or using our Services and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorised use, whether fraudulently or otherwise.</p>

In such an event, you may no longer be able to access and/or use any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (as defined below) associated with that account and no refund will be offered to you in relation to the same.</p>
<p>3.7 You understand that if you delete your account, or if we delete your account in accordance with these terms, you may lose access to any data previously associated with your account (including, without limitation, your progress through our Games and/or the level or score you have reached in our Games and any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods associated with your account).</p>
<p>3.8 YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN ANY ACCOUNT THAT YOU CREATE USING ANY OF OUR SERVICES.
WE MAY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE ANY OF THESE ACCOUNTS AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU.</p>

<p>
</p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Goods and Virtual Money<p>
</p>
<p>4.1 Our Games may include virtual currencies such as gold bars and gems (“Virtual Money"), items or services for use with our Games (“Virtual Goods") or paid subscriptions for Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (“Subscriptions”).
To benefit from or use the Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods in our Games you may first have to reach a certain level or progress to a certain point.
You agree that once purchased Virtual Money, Virtual Goods and/or Subscriptions have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else.
You agree that Virtual Money, Virtual Goods and/or Subscriptions are not transferrable to anyone else and you will not transfer or attempt to transfer any Virtual Money, Virtual Goods and/or Subscriptions to anyone else.
</p>
<p>4.2 You do not own Virtual Goods, Virtual Money and/or Subscriptions but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable licence to use them - any balance of Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money does not reflect any stored value.</p>
<p>4.3 You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods are final, that we will not refund any transaction once it has been made and that an active Subscription cannot be cancelled during the Subscription period.
Prices for all Virtual Money, Virtual Goods and Subscriptions exclude all applicable taxes and telecommunication charges, unless otherwise indicated.
To the extent required by law, you agree to pay any such applicable taxes and telecommunication charges in line with applicable law.
If you live in the European Union you have certain rights to withdraw from distance purchases.
however, please note that when you purchase a licence to use Virtual Goods or Virtual Money from us, you acknowledge and agree that we will begin the provision of the Virtual Goods or Virtual Money to you promptly once your purchase is complete and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point.
For the purposes of this paragraph 4.3, a "purchase" is complete at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money are successfully credited to your account on our servers.</p>
<p>4.4 If you do not connect your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or a King account, we will not be able to restore any Virtual Money or other data associated with your Game play to a different device if you lose that device or it is damaged.
Accordingly, on a device which is not connected in this way:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<br>
<li>any risk of loss of Virtual Money which you purchase from us is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.3 above;</li>
<br>
<li>any risk of loss of Virtual Money that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Virtual Money is successfully credited to your account on our servers.
and</li>
<br>
<li>any risk of loss of other data associated with your Game play (including, without limitation, your progress through the Game, or the level or score you have reached in our Games) is transferred to you immediately at the time such Game play data is generated.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<p>4.5 The data associated with Virtual Goods, whether purchased by you using Virtual Money or otherwise credited or awarded to you, is stored locally on your device and so is not synced between different devices even if you have connected your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or King account.
Accordingly, any risk of loss of this data is transferred to you (i) in the case of Virtual Goods which you purchase from us, upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.3 above.
and/or (ii) in other cases, (including Subscriptions) at the time the Virtual Goods are credited or awarded to you.</p>
<p>4.6 If you live in the European Union, we will provide you with a VAT invoice where we are required to do so by law or where requested by you.
You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format.</p>
<p>4.7 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Money, Virtual Goods and/or Subscriptions without any liability to you at any time, but if you have an active Subscription such changes will only take effect following the end of the then-current Subscription period, at which date your Subscription will automatically terminate.</p>
<p>4.8 We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods, Virtual Money and/or Subscriptions offered through the Services at any time, but if you have an active Subscription such changes will only take effect following the end of the then-current Subscription period, at which date your Subscription will automatically terminate.
We may limit the total amount of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods that may be held in your account in the aggregate.
You are only allowed to obtain Virtual Money and Virtual Goods from us or our authorized partners through the Services, and not in any other way.</p>
<p>4.9 Depending on your platform, any Virtual Goods, Virtual Money or Subscriptions purchased may be subject to your platform provider's terms of service and user agreement.
Usage rights for each purchase may differ from item to item.
If you are unsure about usage rights you should check with your platform or our customer support team before making a purchase.
Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-game store has the same age rating as the game.</p>
<p>4.10 Without limiting paragraphs 3.7, 4.4 or 7.1 if we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these terms you may lose any Virtual Money, and Virtual Goods and/or active Subscriptions (see paragraph 4.12) that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.
If you have an active Subscription at the date of termination it will not auto-renew at the end of the then-current Subscription period.</p>
<p>4.11 The charge for any individual item you can purchase via our Website shall be as stated on our Website at the time you place the order, except in the case of obvious error.
The charge is inclusive of all sales taxes and other charges.
Depending on which bank you use, additional charges may be issued by your bank.
we have no control over this and accept no liability in relation to the same.
If you are unsure whether you will be subject to such additional charges then you should check with your bank before making a purchase via our Website.
We accept payment via our payment processing partners by credit card, debit card, carrier billing and Paypal only.
Our payment processing partners may have their own terms and conditions and you should ensure you are in agreement with these prior to making any payment.
If your transaction with our payment processing partners is not successful then your purchase will not be fulfilled.
Upon the completion of a successful payment transaction then your purchase will be fulfilled to you as soon as possible - we will endeavour to fulfil your order immediately at the point of purchase.</p>
<p>
</p>Subscriptions<br>
<br>4.12 Payment for a Subscription will be charged to your account at the point of purchase and for renewals will be taken within the 24 hours prior to the expiry of the then-current Subscription period.
Your Subscription will automatically renew on a monthly-basis unless you turn off auto-renew via your platform settings at least 24 hours before the end of the then-current Subscription period.
Your Subscription is linked to your platform account and cannot be transferred between platform accounts.
You agree that sales by us to you of Subscriptions are final and that cancellation is not permitted during an active Subscription period.<p>

</p>21 For residents in the United States-- BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:<p>
</p>
<p>21.1 The BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions in this paragraph 21 apply to all Disputes between you and King and/or King’s parents, subsidiaries and Affiliates relating to the Games and Services.
Paragraph 21 also applies to any Dispute between you and any King Affiliates, each of which is an intended third-party beneficiary of paragraph 21.
For the purposes of paragraph 21, “Affiliate” shall mean any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with King, where ‘control’ means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of such entity’s capital or equivalent voting rights and “Dispute” shall include any dispute, claim, controversy or action between you and King (or any King Affiliates) arising out of or relating to this agreement, the Services, or any other transaction involving you and King, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis.</p>
<p>21.2 Initial Dispute Resolution: If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Services, our customer support team can be reached through our King Community portal (http://community.king.com).
Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
<p>21.3 Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph 21.2, then You and King agree that all Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration according to this agreement.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.
Under this agreement, binding arbitration shall be administered by JAMS, a nationally recognized arbitration authority, under its procedures then in effect for consumer related disputes, but excluding any rules that permit joinder or class actions in arbitration (for more detail on procedure, see paragraph 21.5 below).
You and King understand and agree that (a) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this paragraph 21, (b) this agreement memorialises a transaction in interstate commerce, and (c) this paragraph 21 shall survive termination of this agreement.</p>
<p>21.4 Arbitration Procedure: If you or King commences arbitration, the arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect when the arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class or representative basis (the “JAMS Rules”), available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this agreement.
All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and must follow applicable law.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable.
Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is excluded from arbitration under paragraph 21.6.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
In some instances, the costs of arbitration can exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
The arbitrator’s award is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.
Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in Los Angeles, California, at your option.
Instructions for initiating an arbitration are available at the JAMS website and toll-free number referenced above.</p>
<p>21.5 Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>21.6 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Services under these terms.
Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>21.7 30 Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the "Binding Arbitration," "Location," and "Class Action Waiver" paragraphs above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: King.com Ltd Aragon Business Centre Level 4, Dragonara Road, St Julian’s STJ3140, Malta, Attn: King Legal.
The notice must be sent within 30 days of the earlier of your first download of the applicable Game or commencing use of our Services (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the earliest of the date on which you first download the applicable Game or access or commence use the applicable Service).
otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.
If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</p>
<p>21.8 Changes to this paragraph: We will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this paragraph.
Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>
