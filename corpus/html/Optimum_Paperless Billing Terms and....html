</i> Paperless Billing Terms and Conditions <ol>
<li>By enrolling in paperless billing ("Paperless Billing"), you have selected to receive your Optimum bill and associated notices, including potentially service-impacting notices, electronically.
If you request to only receive your bill electronically, you understand and agree that you will no longer receive a paper statement, and Optimum will send electronic notifications that your billing statement is available online to the electronic method you elect to receive account updates and notices, or to the e-mail address you provided during enrollment by default.
Other notices, disclosures or contracts entered outside of the billing cycle may be sent to you directly to your selected method of electronic communication, or to e-mail by default.
By agreeing to Paperless Billing, you are confirming to Optimum that you are able to access all information provided to you in electronic form.
If you have more than one account with us, you will need to select a statement and notice delivery method for each account.</li>

While your Paperless Billing service is being activated, it is your responsibility to keep your accounts current and contact Optimum if you do not receive your bill notice.
You agree that you are responsible for maintaining a valid method of electronic communications, including a valid e-mail address and agree to notify us of any change in your method of electronic communications and e-mail address.</li>

<li>Each bill, together with any legal notices on the bill (including any change(s) in terms) about your Account, will remain available online for a period of up to twelve months.
Inserts included with your bill but not printed on the bill will remain available for up to three months.
You may print these statements or download them to your own system.</li>
