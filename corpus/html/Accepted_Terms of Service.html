<p>This agreement is between Accepted.com, LLC ("Accepted") and its clients who have purchased services from Accepted.
Unless the context requires otherwise, Accepted and/or its assigns shall be referred to as "us, we, or our" and the client&nbsp;shall be referred to as "you or your." &nbsp;</p>
<p>1) You acknowledge that you are the applicant, will write all essays and application materials, and are responsible for all aspects of the essays, resumes, and/or other documents.

In no event will Accepted, its officers, directors, employees, consultants, and representatives be held liable for any damages of any kind, including without limitation compensatory, direct, indirect, or consequential damages, loss of income or data, loss of or damage to property, and claims of third parties arising from any clients' rejection from any undergraduate, graduate, or professional program of any kind.
Accepted disclaims any and all implied or express warranties, including but not limited to, the essays', resumes', or letters' fitness for a particular purpose and your fitness for any job or undergraduate, graduate or professional program.</p>
<p>5) All services are prepaid.&nbsp;Accepted will not provide services unless you have first paid for the services and agreed to our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>6) Accepted’s services can be divided into three categories, i.e., hourly plans and the following two types of flat-rate packages: “One-Year-Application-Cycle Packages” and “Multi-Year Packages.”&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>“Multi-Year Packages,” i.e., The&nbsp;Pre-Med Consulting Package&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Complete College Application Package.</li>
<li>“One-Year-Application-Cycle Packages,” i.e.,&nbsp;all other flat-rate packages, including but not limited to individual and multiple application packages,&nbsp;AMCAS, MD/PHD, masters, and Ph.D.
packages, essay packages, resume packages, and interview packages.
<strong>One Year-Application-Cycle Packages must be used in the application cycle of purchase</strong>.&nbsp;Use of these packages after the application cycle of purchase will result in additional charges.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>7) You understand and agree to our refund policy, which is as follows:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Accepted does not issue refunds for work already performed.</strong>
</li>
<li>We charge a non-refundable one-hour, one-time minimum.</li>
<li>From date of purchase, you have up to one year to request a refund for unused services.
Accepted will not process refunds that are requested more than one year after the date of purchase.
If you are paying via a payment plan, the "date of purchase" is the date of the first payment.</li>
<li>If you purchase an hourly plan and request a refund within one year following the date of purchase,&nbsp;Accepted will calculate your refund as follows: The Amount Paid – [Non-Discounted, Current Hourly Rate * Time].
“Time” is the time your consultant(s) provided services for you.
Time will be at least one hour.</li>
<li>If you purchase one or more flat-rate packages and request a refund within one year following the date of purchase, Accepted will calculate your refund as follows: 95% of {The Amount Paid – [Non-Discounted, Current Hourly Rate * Estimated Time]}.
Please note that Accepted consultants do not track their time on essay or school packages so “Estimated Time” will be an estimate, and the first applications always take the most time.
Estimated Time will always be at least one hour.</li>
<li>If we need to process a refund via any means other than the credit card or Paypal account with which you paid, Accepted will deduct from the refund a processing fee of $75.</li>
</ol>
<p>8)&nbsp.
Service Expiration: Unless you purchased a Multi-Year Package,&nbsp;all work must be completed within two years of purchase or you lose the unused portion of the services that you purchased.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10)&nbsp;While we are happy to explain our services to parents or other potential payors, Accepted does not work with parents, siblings, or other applicant&nbsp;proxies.

<p>11) Accepted reserves the right to refuse service to anyone.</p>
<p>12) Any and all disputes arising under this agreement and not resolved through negotiation shall be resolved through binding arbitration according to the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
