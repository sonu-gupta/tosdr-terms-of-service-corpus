</p>
<p>When you visit any Elastic online property, we may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
We use the following types of cookies: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Strictly Necessary:</strong> These cookies are essential for our websites and their features to work and for us to provide services that depend on our websites and these features (e.g., to remember cookie permission settings, session logins, etc.).</li>
<li>
<strong>Convenience and Personalization:</strong> These cookies enable us to remember the choices you make on our properties (such as your preferred language or your region) and alter or suggest content that matches your navigation patterns on our properties.</li>
<li>
<strong>Performance and Analysis:</strong> These cookies collect aggregated, anonymous, statistical-type information that we use to measure, optimize, and improve the content, quality, and performance of our websites.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising and Retargeting:</strong> These cookies are set by Elastic or by our advertising services to provide you with relevant advertising content.
These also allow us to collect data related to the page you visited and your activities there.
Cookies may also be used when you share information using a social media feature on our website or with services made available via our website.
The social media network may record your activities, which may be linked to targeted advertising.
Those companies' privacy policies will govern how they use the information.</li>
</ul>Other Automatic Data Collection Tools<p>
</p>Web Beacons<p>We may use and permit select third parties to use web beacons (usually in combination with cookies) to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with an email or other communications to measure performance and to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>A web beacon (also known as a web bug or clear GIFs) is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1-pixel x 1-pixel) that can be embedded in online content, pictures, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a specific email message, determine the date and time when you viewed the beacon and the IP address of your device.
For instance, we may include web beacons on our websites and in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether our messages have been opened or acted upon and whether our mailing tools are working correctly.</p>Embedded Web Links<p>Emails from us often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the web, after redirection through our servers.
The redirection system allows us to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our communications and marketing initiatives.
In emails, such web links may also allow us to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and information about this interaction may be connected to your personal identity.</p>Your Options to Control our Use of Cookies/Automatic Data Collection Tools<p>If you do not want to allow cookies or only want to enable the use of certain cookies, please refer to your browser settings.
You can also use your browser settings to withdraw your consent to our use of cookies and delete cookies that have already been set.
