<p>Welcome to Spike.
The following User Terms and Conditions (the “<strong>Terms</strong>“) explain how you can use the Spike mobile apps, websites (including&nbsp;spikenow.com), services and software (collectively “<strong>Spike</strong>“), provided to you by Chatflow Ltd.
(“<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>“).</p>
<p>Please read and get acquainted with these Terms before you get started.
They apply to any users who access Spike (“<strong>users</strong>“), including you.
By using Spike you agree to be bound by all of these Terms and to other terms regarding the collection and use of your information, which are set in our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you are using Spike on behalf of a group or organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that group or organization and represent that you have the authority to do so (and in that case, “<strong>you</strong>” refers to that group or organization).</p>

<strong>1.
What is Spike</strong>
<p>Spike is an application that helps you manage your email from different email providers, using your cellular phone, mobile device or personal computer.
Currently, Spike can interact with a wide range of email providers (and we’re working on expanding the selection), but not all of them.</p>
<p>When you add your email accounts, you authorize Spike to securely access your messages and contacts.
Spike may securely store your email address and password in order to provide you with the service or use authentication methods to avoid storing your password, for email providers that support it.</p>
<p>We store your messages, securely and temporarily, on our servers, in order to let us give you fast access to the messages most important to you (such as new emails) and provide you with access to the full Spike functionalities.
It is important to understand that messages may be deleted from our servers after a few days.
Spike will not be liable for any emails deleted due to the passage of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>2.
