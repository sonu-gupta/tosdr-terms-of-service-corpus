What information do we collect from you?
<p>The information that we save and process comes from various sources.
For example, the online seller in whose shop you have made purchases provides us with information about you and your order.
If necessary, we may obtain further information about you from third parties such as information agencies.
In addition, you naturally share information with us directly when you communicate with us or use our customer portal.
In general, we may collect and process the following information concerning you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Personal and contact information.</strong> Name, title, date of birth, street, house number, postcode, city, email address, telephone number.</li>
<li>
<strong>Payment information.</strong> Billing information, bank account.</li>
<li>
<strong>Information about goods/services.</strong> Information about products you order such as shopping cart and order history.</li>

<strong>Financial information.</strong> Scores shares by information agencies.</li>

<strong>Historical information.</strong> Information about your previous purchases with BillPay and payment history.</li>
<li>
<strong>Device-related information.</strong> For example, the internet protocol address (IP address).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the payment methods “on account” and “direct debit” of BillPay are selected, we will hold the payment claim.
If you select certain payment methods, in particular “PayLater/Ratenkauf”, Klarna Bank AB German Branch, Chausseestraße 117, 10115 Berlin (hereinafter “Klarna”) will be the holder of the claim (Klarna payment method).
In this case, BillPay will be responsible for settling the payment and the associated data processing for Klarna as a technical service provider.
You can find out whether the payment method you have chosen is a Klarna payment method by referring to the general terms and conditions regarding payments methods.
Information collected will generally only be used for the purposes of payment settlement and in this regard, to fulfil a contractual obligation with us.
The individual processing steps are described below.</p>
How do we use your information?
<p>Payment settlement, payment reminders and debt collection</p>
<p>As the holder of the payment claim of your contractual obligation with the seller (e.g.
purchase), we are equally entitled to collect information about you which is required to enforce this payment obligation.
This also includes the processing of information for the purpose of payment reminders and debt collections.
For this purpose, your information may also be shared with third-parties whom we engage.
The legal basis for the processing of data in this respect is the need to fulfil the contractual payment obligation.</p>
<p>If you have selected an instalment plan via BillPay, your information will be sent to the partner company GiroSolution AG, Hauptstraße 27, 88699 Frickingen, and processed, saved and used by the latter in order to enable the first instalment payment.
The legal basis for the processing of data in this respect is the need to fulfil the contractual payment obligation.</p>
<p>Credit investigation</p>
<p>If you select BillPay payment methods, BillPay will check, taking into account any possible default risks, if your wish can be fulfilled or if another payment method can be offered with the agreement of the seller.
For this purpose, BillPay will conduct its own identity and credit investigation after confirming the desired payment method.
The legal basis for the processing of data in this respect is the need to fulfil the contractual payment obligation.</p>
<p>As part of this identity and credit investigation, the seller will share your information (last name, first name, title, street, house number, postcode, city, date of birth, email address, telephone number and, for purchases paid by direct debit, the bank account submitted, and any other personal details) as well as information connected with your order (e.g.
shopping cart, order history, payment experiences, IP address, and personal information together with personal details) with BillPay.</p>
<p>BillPay shares personal information collected as part of this contractual relationship regarding the application procedure, execution and end of this business relationship, as well as information regarding breaches of contract or fraudulent conduct, with information agencies.
The legal basis for the sharing of data is the need to fulfil the contractual payment obligation.
The purpose of sharing information with the information agencies is also to meet statutory obligations to carry out investigations of the creditworthiness of customers (sections 505a and 506 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch).</p>
<p>The information agencies process the information received for the purpose of profiling (scoring) so that they can give information regarding inter alia the credit assessments of natural persons to contractual partners in the European Economic Area and Switzerland as well as potentially other third countries (if the the European Commission has issued a decision that it finds the third country concerned to have suitable data protection mechanisms).

<p>Regarding Switzerland, an EU adequacy decision pursuant to Art.
45 para.
3 GDPR has been adopted.
Consequently, the level of data protection available in Switzerland is also adequate.</p>
<p>BillPay is part of Klarna Group.
Therefore, other Group companies, in particular Klarna Bank AB (publ), Sveavägen 46, 113 43 Stockholm, Sweden (“Klarna”), may also be included in the credit investigation described above.
As a result, the findings of a credit investigation may be shared to a limited extent with Klarna in order to improve the findings and processed by Klarna for its own future credit investigations.
Conversely, the credit investigation and any decisions made on the basis of its result may, in some cases, be undertaken entirely by Klarna for the further performance of the contract.
In this case, the relevant positive and negative payment experiences will first be transferred to Klarna and then deleted after the transaction is completed.
The legal basis for sharing this information is the legitimate administrative interest of BillPay to compare and harmonise the decisions of the credit investigation with Group companies.</p>
<p>The decision to permit you to use the payment methods of BillPay is an automated decision made on a case-by-case basis in accordance with Art.
22 German General Data Protection Regulation (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, DSGVO).
This automatic decision is required for BillPay to assume and enforce the payment claim against you.
If the score obtained for your creditworthiness is below a predefined limit, you will not be offered any BillPay payment methods.
This will not involve any human judgement or decision-making.
You have the right, if the use of BillPay payment methods is not permitted, to contact BillPay and to present your position and to argue for a change of decision.
For this purpose, please contact datenschutz@billpay.de.</p>
<p>Fraud prevention</p>
<p>For the purpose of preventing fraud, your information will also be analysed using certain parameters for patterns of improper or fraudulent conduct.
External tools may be used for this purpose.
In this case, your information will be transmitted on the basis of an order processing agreement.
Information regarding conduct in breach of contract may also be shared with the aforementioned information agencies.
Legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest in preventing fraud in the use of our services.</p>
<p>BillPay has hired the services, as controller for fraud prevention through device fingerprinting, of ThreatMetrix Inc., 160 W.
Santa Clara Street, Suite 1400, San Jose, 95113 California, USA.
For these purposes, your IP address is processed in the USA and linked to other non personal data to generate a device fingerprint which can be used to recognize your device when you use BillPay again.
An adequate level of protection is guaranteed through an agreement signed with ThreatMetrix Inc., which includes standard contractual clauses pursuant to Art.
46 II c) and Art.
93 II GDPR.</p>
<p>General data analysis</p>
<p>We analyse the customer information collected to improve our services and plan the prepared resources.
The legal basis for the processing of data in this regard is our legitimate interest in the further development and improvement of our services as well as in part the need to fulfil the contract.</p>
<p>Communication with you</p>
<p>We may also use the contact information you submit to contact you by telephone or email and to inform you about BillPay’s services which you have previously selected or services similar to these.
If you do not wish to be contacted, you can inform us of this at any time and without incurring any separate costs by writing to service@billpay.de.</p>
<p>Compliance with statutory obligations</p>
<p>We also process your information if this is required to fulfil statutory obligations such as the storage of business documents or to fulfil a statutory obligation to share or otherwise disclose information.
The legal basis in this respect is the need to fulfil a legal obligation.</p>
<p>Data processing in relation to the website</p>
<p>Personal information is processed in our website if this is required for the comfortable and error-free functionality of the website and the use of its features such as the processing of an inquiry.
