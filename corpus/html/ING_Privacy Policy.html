Who we share your data with and why <p>To offer you the best possible services and remain competitive in our business, we share certain data internally i.e., with other ING businesses and externally (i.e., outside of ING) with third parties.
</p>
<p>Whenever we share your personal data externally (i.e., outside of ING) with third parties in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) we ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect it.
For this purpose, we rely upon, amongst others: </p>
<p>Requirements based on applicable local laws and regulations.
</p>
<p>EU Model clauses, when applicable, we use standardised contractual clauses in agreements with service providers to ensure personal data transferred outside of the European Economic Area complies with GDPR.
</p>
<p>International treaties such as the EU US Privacy Shield framework that protects personal data transferred to certain service providers in the United States.</p>
<p>For all customers:</p> ING entities <p>We transfer data across ING businesses and branches for various purposes (see section ‘What we do with your personal data’ for the full list).
We may also transfer data to centralised storage systems or to process it at a central point within ING for efficiency purposes.
For all internal data transfers we rely on our binding corporate rules as defined in EC Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which is our Global Data Protection Policy (GDPP), and on the applicable local laws and regulations.</p> Government, Supervisory and Judicial authorities <p>To comply with our regulatory obligations we may disclose data to the relevant government, supervisory and judicial authorities such as: </p>

The TPP may do so only if you have given your explicit consent to those services.</p>
<p>When we receive a request from a TPP on your behalf, we are obliged to carry out the request for payment or account information, as requested.
</p>
<p>Additionally you can also use the PSD2 services to manage your accounts with other banks through your ING channels or apps.
You may use the ING app or channel to </p>
<p>View account information of your current payment accounts with other banks;</p>
<p>Make online payments from your current payment account with other banks.</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>For individuals who are customers only:</strong>
</p> Independent agents, brokers and business partners <p>We may share your personal data with independent agents, brokers or business partners who act on our behalf, or which jointly offer products and services with us, such as insurance.
They are registered in line with local legislation and operate with due permission of regulatory bodies.
</p> Researchers <p>We are always looking for new insights to help you get ahead in life and in business.
For this reason, we exchange personal data (when it’s legally allowed) with partners like universities and other independent research institutions, who use it in their research and innovation.
The researchers we engage must satisfy the same strict requirements as ING employees.
The personal data is shared at an aggregated level and the results of the research are anonymous.
</p> Credit reporting bodies <p>For customers who apply for a credit facility with us in Australia, you agree that we may exchange your personal data with a credit reporting body ("CRB"), including by sharing information about:</p>
<p>your identity</p>
<p>your credit worthiness</p>
<li>your credit history, including about the type of credit you have (like credit cards, personal loans and home loans), how much you have borrowed and if you've made your repayments (including repayments you're required to make under your ING credit facility with us) </li>
<li>whether you have committed fraud or another serious credit infringement, and </li>
<li>obtaining commercial credit information about you in order to assess an application by you for consumer credit.
</li>
<li>The CRBs we use include Equifax Australia Information Services &amp.
Solutions Pty Limited ("Equifax") (equifax.com.au) and illion Australia Pty Ltd ("illion") (illion.com.au).
The privacy policy of each of Equifax and illion explains how it manages your personal information and can be found on its website.
</li>
<p>CRBs may include information that we provide in reports to other credit providers to assist those credit providers to assess your credit worthiness.
We may ask a CRB to give us your overall credit score, and we may use credit information from CRBs together with other information to arrive at our own credit score of your ability to manage your credit obligations.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Pre-screening assessments</i>
<br> Credit providers (like us) can ask CRBs to use your credit information to pre-screen you for direct marketing purposes, but you can tell CRBs not to do this.
However, by applying for a credit facility with us, you may still receive direct marketing from us (unless you ask us not to) that has not been 'pre screened'.
</p> Fraud - 'ban period' <p>If you believe, on reasonable grounds, that you have been, or could be, a victim of fraud (for example, someone else may be using your name to apply for credit), you can ask CRBs not to use or give anyone your credit information during a 'ban period'.
<br> The 'ban period' is a period of 21 days starting on the day you make the request.
That period can be extended on your request where the CRB believes on reasonable grounds that you have been, or are likely to be, the victim of fraud.
By applying for a credit facility with us, you agree to us accessing your personal information held with a CRB, even if there is a ban period in place, for the purposes of assessing an application for credit or in order to collect overdue payments.
</p> Credit providers <p>For customers who apply for a credit facility with us in Australia, you agree that we may disclose information about you (including about your credit worthiness, credit history and repayment history information) to other credit providers to assess an application by you for credit, to notify them of a default by you and to inform other credit providers who allege you are in default with them.
You also agree that we may disclose your information to any person reasonably necessary for the purposes of that person taking an assignment of any contract the lender has with you.
</p> Transfer of personal information overseas <p>Sometimes we may send your information overseas - for example, where we send information to ING Group members overseas or outsource functions overseas.
If we do this, we make sure there are arrangements in place to protect your information.
For customers in Australia, the countries to which your information may be sent include the Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.

We will require you to verify your identity, or the identity and authority of your representative, to our reasonable satisfaction.
</p>
<p>An access charge may apply, but not to your request for access itself.
In particular, we may impose a reasonable charge for providing access to this information to recover any expenses incurred in retrieving and collating the requested information.
Where an access charge applies, unless you authorise us to debit your account with us, access won't be provided until we receive payment.
We will respond to your access request as soon as possible and tell you how long it will take to provide the information.
This may be up to 28 days in some circumstances.
</p>
<p> We may exercise our right to deny access to particular information in certain situations, for example, where access may reveal our commercially sensitive decision processes (e.g.
criteria for loan approvals), where the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings, or where it will threaten the privacy of other individuals.
</p>
<p>If we deny you access to your personal information, we will write to you to:</p>
<p>explain the reason your access request has been denied unless it would be unreasonable for us to do so in the circumstances.

If we correct the personal information the subject of your correction request and we have previously disclosed that information to a third party, we will notify that third party of the corrected information (if we're required to by law).</p>
<p>If we disagree with your request to correct your personal information, we will write to you to: explain the reason your correction request has been denied unless it would be unreasonable for us to do so.
and the avenues available to you to complain about our refusal.
</p>
<p>If we disagree with your request to correct your personal information, you also have the right to ask us to attach a statement that in your opinion the information is in your opinion inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading.
However, please note that this right does not apply to our refusal to correct your credit information.</p> Right to object to processing <p>You can object to ING using your personal data for its own legitimate interests if you have a justifiable reason.
We will consider your objection and whether processing your information has any undue impact on you that would require us to stop processing your personal data.

<p>When your credit or debit card is blocked;</p>
<p>When a transaction is requested from an unusual location.
</p> Right to object to automated decisions <p>We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on your personal information if this is necessary to fulfil a contract with you, or if you gave us consent to do so.
