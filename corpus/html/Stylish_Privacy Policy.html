<b>STYLISH PRIVACY POLICY</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Last modified: August 30, 2020</i>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>We are SimilarWeb and this is our privacy policy for our Stylish product and service.
If you have read privacy policies before, you may have found that they are difficult to understand and often overwhelm you with information.
So we will try to keep this simple and get to the bottom line right away: <i>
<b>We do not want to know your identity or any other personal information and we do not automatically collect data to try and figure out who you are</b>
</i>.
Of course, we need to give you all of the regular privacy policy information to which you are entitled, and we will get to that in a minute.
But first, and in case you do not have the time or patience to read through the whole policy, we want to repeat and make that point perfectly clear: <i>
<b>We do not want to know your identity</b>
</i> - unless you decide to share it by registering on our website or contacting us for support, in which case we will use it only for that purpose.
Otherwise, <i>
<b>any data collected from you simply by your use of our product will never be used to figure out who you are or to send you targeted ads, and will not be shared with any other parties for those purposes</b>
</i>.
</p>
<p>In the rest of this privacy policy, we are going to give you a lot of detail about exactly what data is collected from you, how it is processed, where it is stored, and what your rights are as a user.
That is important information, and we certainly hope you carefully read the entire policy.
As a user of a product from which data is processed, you are entitled to that information and we are obligated to make it available.
That makes sense and is as it should be, since you deserve to be protected from intrusive data practices.
Compliance with data privacy laws and regulations, including the GDPR, is extremely important to us and is a top priority in our activities as a global company.</p>
<p>Sure, we do collect information from you when you use our product.
The information is collected using code that is open-source and which can be inspected by anyone capable of doing so.
We realize that most users may not be able to read that code, but the point is, the purpose of that data collection is to provide for your use the best Stylish product and service we can.
We have no interest in knowing the identity of any individual users, and we invest enormous resources to ensure that we are not able to do so.
(For example, we use an algorithm designed to remove from collected browser data any personal information that maybe have been inadvertently included in it.
We also delete from IP addresses the portion that provides specific geolocation information.
</p>
<p>If you got this far, we hope you will continue and read the rest of this policy.
Either way, if you decide to use our Stylish product or services and have any questions about your rights as a user, feel free to contact us at <u>support@userstyles.org</u>,
</p>
<p>As data protection is important to us, we have engaged an external data privacy expert to serve as our Data Protection Officer.
If you have any questions regarding this policy or your data privacy rights, you are welcome to contact our Data Protection Officer at:</p>
