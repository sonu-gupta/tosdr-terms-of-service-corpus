<strong>Accessing Our Web Sites from Outside of the United States</strong>
<br> Our websites are designed for, and intended to be used exclusively by, United States residents.
We are not responsible for their use in any foreign nation or territory.
If you are visiting our websites from a location outside of the United States your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States.
Any information you provide during your visit will be processed and maintained on our webserver and other internal systems located within the United States.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp.
<p>
<strong>External Links</strong>
<br> Our websites contain links to other sites run by third parties.
Our dealership is not responsible in any way for such third-party websites, including, without limitation the privacy practices or the content of such sites.
To help ensure the protection of your privacy, we recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site you visit.</p>
<p>
<strong>Public Forums</strong>
<br> Our websites may utilize chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or similar forum technologies at various times.
Unless otherwise stated, any information that is disclosed in these areas is public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information in these areas, especially any personal information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</strong>
<br> We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us.
We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking Technologies and Advertising.&nbsp;You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</li>
<li>Opt-Out Procedures.&nbsp;If you do not wish to have your email address used by the Company to promote our products or services, you can opt-out by sending us an email stating your request to the email address listed at the bottom of this policy.
Our websites allow users to opt-out of receiving communications at the point where personal information is requested, or through other identified means.
If we have sent you a promotional email, you may send us a return email asking to be omitted from future email distributions or use the unsubscribe link provided in our email to you.
This opt out does not apply to non-advertising information provided to the Company as a result of a product purchase, warranty registration, product service experience or other transactions (for example, our dealership may need to contact you regarding a vehicle warranty issue).
If you have any difficulty in opting-out of any communications from our dealership, please immediately contact us at the phone number and email listed below.</li>
</ul>
<br> Additionally, some browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not want to be tracked.
&nbsp;Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to a DNT signal, we do not currently respond to DNT signals on this website or on websites where we provide advertisements, content, or other services.<p>
