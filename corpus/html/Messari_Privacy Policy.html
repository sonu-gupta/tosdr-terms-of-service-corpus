<u>Contact Us</u>.
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or its implementation, you may contact support@messari.io.
If you believe your information is wrong, we may provide you with ways to update it quickly or to remove it, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.
If updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, risk the privacy of others, require disproportionate technical effort (e.g., developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), or would otherwise be extremely impractical (e.g., requests for information residing in backup storage that is not easily accessible).<b>

<p>10.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<u>Changes to this Policy</u>.
We may update our Privacy Policy from time, and so you should review this Policy periodically.
We may reach out to you on the Site, by email notification, or by some other means to inform you of any changes to the Policy.
If you have opted not to receive legal notice emails from us, or you havenâ€™t provided your email address, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding the Policy.
Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.<b>
