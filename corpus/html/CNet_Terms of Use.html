<li> Disputes.
Arbitration <p>If you have any dispute with or claim against us or any of our affiliates, or if we have a dispute with or claim against you, in either case arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms (a “<strong>Claim</strong>”), and the Claim is not resolved by calling our customer service department at (888)274-5343, you and we each agree to resolve such Claim through an individual binding arbitration or through an individual action in small claims court in the U.S.
county (or parish) of your residence or in San Francisco, California.
Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may not be consolidated with any other person’s claim.
You and we agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This Section 17 shall survive termination of these Terms or any subscription that you may have to any of the Services.</p>
<p>Before you or we commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action with respect to a Claim, you must first send to CBS Interactive a written notice of your claim or we must send a written notice of our claim to you (“<strong>Notice</strong>“).

(2) be addressed to: CBS Interactive, 235 Second Street, San Francisco, CA 94105Attn: Legal Department.
(3) describe the nature of your Claim.
and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek.
If we and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after our receipt of Notice is received, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action to resolve the Claim.</p>
<p>Any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association and be conducted in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”).
Contact information for the American Arbitration Association, as well as copies of the Rules and applicable forms, are available at http://www.adr.org In circumstances in which the Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will take place in the U.S.
county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in San Francisco, California.
For any non-frivolous Claim that does not exceed $50,000, CBS Interactive will pay all costs of the arbitration, and reimburse any filing fees you may be required to pay.
