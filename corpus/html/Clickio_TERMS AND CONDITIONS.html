<li> Modification of the General Business Terms and Conditions for Publishers <ol>
<li>ALZ reserve the right to amend the Terms and to do so without citing any reasons.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li> Change of ownership <ol>
<li>The rights and duties under the Terms may only be transferred with the prior written consent of ALZ.</li>
<li>In accepting these Terms the Publisher will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Clickio Platform or ALZ, of any information about the Publisher, including the Publisher's registration details and personal data.</li>
<li>In the event of a change of ownership or operator as above, the Publisher's continued use of the Clickio Platform signifies the Partner's agreement to be bound by the Agreement with the subsequent owner or operator.

</ol> Final provisions
<ol>
<li>Should any individual provision of these Terms be of no effect, as a whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.
The invalid provision will be deemed replaced by that provision that is legally effective and comes closest, in the usual understanding, to the economic intent and purpose of the invalid provision.
The same applies to any unintentional omission.</li>
<li>The utilisation of the Network and its applications requires the use of special technical systems such as end user devices, software programs, transmission networks, telecommunications and other services provided by third parties, all of which may entail further costs.
ALZ does not provide such end user devices, software programs, communication channels, telecommunications services or other services and therefore will not assume any liability for such services provided by third parties.</li>
<li>The Agreement does not establish a company or a partnership between the parties, it does not authorise either of the parties to make any legally binding declarations on behalf of both parties together, or on behalf of the respective other party, nor does it authorize them to place the respective other party under any obligation or to represent it in any other way.</li>
