<p>
<strong>WHY and HOW Do We Use Your Personal Data?</strong>
</p>
<p>We use your personal data in the following ways:</p>
<p>
<strong>To Provide the Features of the Platform and the Services You Request</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use our Platform, we will use your personal data to provide the requested product or service.&nbsp.
For example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com, or participate in an event or promotion, we will use the contact information you give us to communicate with you about the purchase, event or promotion.
If you contact our consumer services, we will use information about you, such as delivery or payment information, or the product you have purchased to help you resolve a problem or question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use our Platform to track your fitness activity or physical characteristics, we will collect this personal data and store it so that you can review it in the Platform.&nbsp.
Your fitness activity data may include data you enter about your activity or data collected by your device during your activity such as location data and movement data.&nbsp.
We may use this activity data to calculate further information about your activity, such as distance run, or calories burned, so that the calculated information can be provided to you as part of the functionality of the Platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many cases, to use particular features within our Platform you may need to provide Nike with additional data or additional consent to use particular data in a certain way.&nbsp.
For example, to use the heart rate tracking features of our Platform, you may need to connect to a heart rate monitoring device.
Similarly, to share content on social media, you may be required to provide your social media account credentials to sign in.</p>
<p>
<strong>To Communicate Information about our Products, Services, Events and for Other Promotional Purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are an existing customer of Nike (for example, if you have placed an order with us), we may use the contact details you provided to send you marketing communications about similar Nike products or services, where permitted by applicable law (unless you have opted out).
In other cases, we ask for your consent to send you marketing information.</p>
<p>We may use the information that you provide to us as, well as information from other Nike products or services such as your use of Nike’s Platform to personalize communications and advertisements regarding our products and services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp.
For registered users, this may include data collected from your interactions with our Platform that are associated with your account across devices.</p>
<p>
<strong>To Operate, Improve and Maintain our Business, Products and Services</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use the personal data you provide to us to operate our business.&nbsp.
For example, when you make a purchase, we use that information for accounting, audits and other internal functions.&nbsp.
We may use personal data about how you use our products and services to enhance your user experience and to help us diagnose technical and service problems and administer our Platform.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>To Protect Our or Others' Rights, Property or Safety</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use personal data about how you use our Platform to prevent, detect, or investigate fraud, abuse, illegal use, violations of our Terms of Use, and to comply with court orders, governmental requests or applicable law.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
