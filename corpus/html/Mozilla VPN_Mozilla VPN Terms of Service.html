        Mozilla VPN Terms of Service
<p>Version 3.1, effective April 28, 2021</p>
<p>Mozilla VPN (“Service”) is a Virtual Private Network in partnership with Mullvad.
Please read these Terms of Service carefully because they explain important information about your use of the Service.</p>
<p>If you activate this Service, it keeps your internet traffic private from your internet service provider and most websites you visit by encrypting and routing it through our partner’s networks instead.
It will also replace your actual IP address to keep your personal IP address private from others, such as the websites you visit and your internet service provider.</p>
You Must Be Eligible to Use the Service
<p>You must be in a country where the Service is available to download Mozilla VPN and use the Service.
Currently, the Service is available in United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Germany, France, Singapore, and Malaysia.
A Firefox Account is required to use the Service.</p>
<p>To create a Firefox Account, you will also need to agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Notice for your Firefox Account.</p>

<strong>Your Privacy.</strong> The Mozilla VPN Privacy Notice explains what information is sent when you use the Service and how we handle and share that information.</p>
