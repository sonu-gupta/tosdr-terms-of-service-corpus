is always stored by the services themselves and requires explicit consent
given by the facing user to fetch it.

the services privacy policies: Google Privacy Policy,
Trello Privacy Policy and
Miro Privacy Policy.</p>

</li>
</ul>
How we process media (audio/video)
<p>We will never store any media sent between participants in a
room.
Customers who have access to the “Recording” feature will be
able to record meetings, and they are then responsible for collecting
consents from all participants in the meeting prior to starting the
recording.
They are also responsible for storing and processing the
recording in compliance with regulations after downloading it from
Whereby.</p>
Security
<p>In the FREE version of the Service, users can use “Small meeting” mode
(up to 4 participants).
In “Small meeting” mode, communication between
participants are primarily sent through peer-to-peer connections,
where audio and video streams are sent directly between participants
and do not pass through any of our servers.
Video and audio
transmitted in the Service is then sent directly between the
participants in a room and is encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) with
client-generated encryption keys.
In cases where a user is behind a
strict firewall or NAT, video and audio need to be relayed via a TURN
server, but end-to-end encryption is still maintained.</p>
<p>If you have upgraded a room to PRO, you can choose to use “Large
meeting” mode (up to 12 participants).
Calls using “Large meeting”
mode will use a dedicated server infrastructure to allow more people
in conversation, and better stability.
Your stream will be sent
through video router servers which transmits it to the other
participants in the call, and also transmits their streams to
you.
Streams will always be encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) in transit, but will
be decrypted and re-encrypted when passing through the video
routers.
We operate an infrastructure of video routers distributed
across the world, and you will be automatically routed to the closest
one.
The video router servers and all of our infrastructure adhere to
strict security measures, preventing any eavesdropping or interruption
of the video/audio streams.</p>

<p>We may share information about with third parties in some
circumstances, including: (1) with your consent.
(2) to a service
provider or partner who meets our data protection standards.
(3) with
academic or non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization.
(4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as

will prevent harm to someone or illegal activities.</p>
