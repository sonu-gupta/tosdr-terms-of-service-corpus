Registration Agreement</b>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Initial term and included services:</b>
Domain names are registered for a one year initial term, unless otherwise specified on our web site.
The registration fee includes use of Domainnameshop's nameservers or delegation to external nameservers.
Any other services for the domain, such as email and web hosting, must be ordered separately and paid for according to the fees published on https://domainnameshop.com/pricelist.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Domain name registration is binding and non-refundable:</b>
An application for domain name registration is binding from the time Domainnameshop receives the application.
Domain name registration is a service which is considered to be delivered in full at the time of registration, and as such the Norwegian <i>Act on the right to repent a sale of goods after a cooling-off period (Angrerettloven)</i> which gives the customer 14 days to regret and cancel consumer purchases done through phone, mail or the Internet, does not apply.
As soon as the domain name application is sent from Domainnameshop to the Registry Operator, the application cannot be cancelled, and the registration fee must be paid in full.
This also applies if you should change your mind and do not want to register the domain or if you want to cancel the domain before the end of the registration term.
All registration fees and renewal fees are non-refundable.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Eligibility requirements:</b>
Different TLDs have different eligibility requirements, and you warrant that the domain name applicant meets the requirements for the TLD under which you apply for a domain.
For example, domain names under .eu can only be registered by persons and organizations within the European Union/European Economic Area, and domain names under .no can only be registered by Norwegian organizations and private individuals resident in Norway.
For a complete list of eligibility requirements, please refer to the Registry Operator's policies for each TLD (see Appendix 1).</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Third party rights:</b>
When submitting a domain name application, you are solely responsible for ensuring that neither the domain name itself nor the manner in which it is directly or indirectly used violates or infringes in any ways the rights, including trademark rights, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of any third party.
Domainnameshop recommends that you undertake the necessary research, including a trademark search, to ensure that a successful registration will not not violate or infringe any third party rights, before submitting the application.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Required information:</b> You agree to provide Domainnameshop with the following contact information for each domain name application: (1) the full name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and (where available) fax number of the Registered Name Holder, (2), the name of an authorized person for contact purposes in the case of a Registered Name Holder that is an organization, association or corporation, (3) the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and (where available) fax number of the administrative contact for the domain name, and (4) the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and (where available) fax number of the technical contact for the domain name.
Under some TLDs, you must also specify additional identification information for the Registered Name Holder, such as an organization number or VAT number (if the Registered Name holder is an organization, association or corporation) or a birth date or national identification number (if the Registered Name Holder is an individual).
In addition, you must provide the primary nameserver and secondary nameserver(s) for the domain name.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Registered Name Holder:</b> The Registered Name Holder ("domain holder", "holder" or "registrant") means the person or legal entity who is the holder of a registered domain name, as specified in the contact information for the domain name.
If you are the Registered Name Holder, you understand and accept that Domainnameshop in capacity as registrar for your domain will act on your behalf towards the Registry Operator in all matters concerning registration, renewal and maintenance of your domain.
If you yourself are not the Registered Name Holder, but are ordering or paying for services or otherwise controls the management of the domain name on behalf of the Registered Name Holder, then you acknowledge and warrant that you have obtained the Registered Name Holder's explicit permission to act on its behalf and enter into this Agreement, and that the Registered Name Holder has been informed of all relevant parts of this Agreement pertaining to its domain name registration.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Account Holder:</b> The Account Holder means the person or legal entity who controls the username and password for managing the domain name in Domainnameshop's control panel at https://domainnameshop.com/login.
If you are the registrant of the domain, you authorize that the Account Holder may update nameservers, DNSSEC parameters, contact information and all other domain name data on your behalf.
You understand that this authorization can only be revoked for as long as you are still listed as the registrant in the domain name record.
You further agree to release, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Domainnameshop against any claims, losses, and liabilities arising out of any dispute between you and the Account Holder.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>License of use:</b> A Registered Name Holder that intends to license use of a domain name to a third party is nonetheless the Registered Name Holder of record and is responsible for providing its own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Accuracy of registration data:</b> You agree to provide Domainnameshop with accurate and reliable contact details and to correct and update them within 7 (seven) days of any change during the term of the domain name registration.
If you intentionally provide inaccurate or unreliable information, fail to update the information within 7 (seven) days of any change, or fail to respond over 15 (fifteen) days to Domainnameshop's inquiries about the accuracy of the contact details, this shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and be a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name registration.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Data processing and publication:</b>
You understand and consent to that Domainnameshop may store and process the contact data you provide under "Required Information" above and share this information with Registry Operators and law-enforcement authorities for the purpose of identifying and contacting the Registered Name Holder, administrative or technical contact in the event of a domain name dispute, suspicion of unlawful activities, technical problem or other urgent issue relating to the domain.
You may access and update the contact data at any time from the control panel at https://domainnameshop.com/login.
Domainnameshop agrees that we will not process the contact data in a way that is incompatible with the purposes set forth above, and that we will take reasonable precautions to protect contact data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
If you provide contact data on any third party person who has not entered into this Agreement, you represent that this person has been informed about and consented to the data processing principles outlined above.
You further agree that the following information may be made publicly available on the Internet via WHOIS (e.g.
https://domainnameshop.com/whois) and other means: (1) the domain name registered.
(2) the name, postal address, email address, and telephone and fax numbers for the registrant and contact persons for the domain (if required by the WHOIS policy for the TLD).
(3) the hostnames and IP addresses of the nameservers for the domain, and, (4) the date of registration, date of last modification and expected expiration date.
For details on which data elements that are published in WHOIS, please refer to the WHOIS policy for each TLD (see list in Appendix 1).
For more detailed information regarding processing and publishing of personal data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Dispute resolution:</b>
You agree to be bound by the appropriate domain dispute resolution policy ("Dispute Policy") applicable to the domain that you have selected.
The Dispute Policies are hereby incorporated and made a part of this Agreement by reference (see Appendix 1).
Certain disputes, as specified in the applicable Dispute Policy, are subject to that Policy.
In the event such dispute arises, you agree that you will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in effect at the time your domain registration is disputed by a third party.
The Dispute Policy may be modified at any time by the applicable Registry Operator(s) and your continued use of the domain registered to you after any such Dispute Policy modification shall constitute your acceptance of the modified Dispute Policy.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Right to refuse or cancel registration:</b>
Domainnameshop reserves the right to reject your domain name application for any reason it may see fit, for example in case of suspicion of inaccurate information provided by you, suspicion that the domain will be used for any unlawful purpose, or if Domainnameshop has doubts about your credibility or solvency.
You also agree that a successful domain name registration may later be subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer (1) if an ICANN adopted specification or policy requires it, (2) to correct mistakes by Domainnameshop or the Registry Operator in registering the domain name, or (3) for the resolution of disputes concerning the registered domain name.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Submission of application does not guarantee registration:</b>
A successfully submitted domain name application to Domainnameshop is no guarantee that the domain can actually be registered.
The domain may be reserved or prohibited to register, it may be registered by someone else, the application may be incomplete, there may be technical errors (for example incorrect configuration of nameservers), or other errors that prevent the domain from being registered.
As a registrar, Domainnameshop's responibility is restricted to forwarding the application from you to the Registry Operator for the TLD in question and communicate the result of the registration request from the Registry Operator back to you.
Domainnameshop shall not be held liable for any possible errors or inaccuracies related to the submission of the application to the Registry Operator, whether caused by you, by Domainnameshop or by the Registry Operator.
Applications are normally forwarded promptly from Domainnameshop to the Registry Operator, but no guarantee about this is given.
Please note that it may happen that a domain name is available at the time you submit your application to Domainnameshop, but not at the time Domainnameshop forwards the application to the Registry Operator.
Domainnameshop strongly discourages that you start using the domain name on material for commercial purposes, business cards etc., before you have received a confirmation from Domainnameshop that the domain has been successfully registered.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Renewal and expiration of domain:</b>
You are solely responsible for ensuring that any and all domains and additional services are renewed prior to their expiration date, should you so desire their renewal.
Domainnameshop shall have no liability to you or any third party in connection with the renewal, including, but not limited to, any failure or errors in renewing the services.
You may be notified at Domainnameshop's sole discretion when renewal fees are due.
Should these fees go unpaid within the time specified in a notice or reminder regarding renewal, your registration will be cancelled and the domain deleted from the registry.
If your billing information is not accurate, you are solely responsible for the failure to renew.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Restoration of deleted domain:</b> For registries that enforce a Redemption Grace Period (RGP), a deleted domain may be restored by paying an additional redemption restoration fee in addition to the annual renewal fee, within the time frame of the grace period, as defined by the Registry Operator (usually 30 days).
For registries that do not have a RGP policy, restoration of a deleted domain is not possible.
The redemption restoration fee for a given TLD can be found in our pricelist on https://domainnameshop.com/pricelist.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>

In particular, you agree that a change of registrant must be approved by both the current and the new registrant, and that the new registrant must accept to enter into this Agreement before the change of registrant can be processed.
If you are the current registrant of the domain, you further agree that the Account Holder for your domain may act as a "Designated Agent" according to the ICANN Inter-Registrant Transfer Policy, and you give your explicit authorization that the Account Holder may approve the change of registrant on your behalf.</li>

Internet users that type in your domain in a web browser will be redirected to a Parking Page.
By using Domainnameshop's nameservers, you hereby consent to and authorize Domainnameshop's placement of a Parking Page on your parked domain.
In the event that your domain registration expires and is not renewed on time, you also authorize Domainnameshop to change the nameservers for your domain and redirect it to a Parking Page.
You may change the nameservers back again (or "un-park" the domain) after the renewal is complete.</li>

</p>
<li>
<b>Pre-orders:</b>
The following additional terms and conditions contained in this section apply where you authorize and direct Domainnameshop to attempt to register a domain name if and when the applicable Registry Operator launches a new TLD, a new domain policy, or a new service ("Pre-Order").

Domainnameshop makes no guarantees, representations, or warranties that a particular domain name will be available now or in the future, or at any time.

You understand and acknowledge that the price list on https://domainnameshop.com/pricelist only displays standard prices.

Terms and Conditions for Hosting Services</b>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Hosting service:</b>
With "hosting service", we refer to any service that utilizes Domainnameshop's servers or IP addresses.
This includes, but is not limited to, web hosting, email, unix shell access, database access, our site builder, our web forwarding service, and use of our nameservers (DNS).
All hosting services are subject to our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and to the limitations and restrictions specified in our FAQ, such as rate limiting of email messages and database queries, memory restrictions on PHP scripts and running processes, etc.
We reserve the right to update our FAQ with new limits and restrictions at any time, and these new limits and restrictions will come into effect at the time of publishing.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Web hosting:</b>
The web hosting service ("web hosting" or "web hotel") is a service where you rent disk space on one of Domainnameshop's servers.
You are assigned a username and a password, which gives you access to your own file directory for storage of files (web pages, documents, images, scripts, programs, etc.) that you upload yourself via a file transfer program.
You understand and agree that Domainnameshop only provides the disk space, and that you take full responsibility for the contents of all files that are uploaded to your web hotel.
If you install any scripts or programs, you agree to keep these up to date at all times, and to promptly upgrade to a newer version whenever needed to fix security issues.
You further agree to assume full and complete responsibility for, and agree that Domainnameshop shall have no responsibility or liability for, your end users' content and all activities on your web site (e.g.
contents in a forum or comments on a blog).
You understand and agree that, if you transfer your domain name or web hosting service to a third party in conjunction with a live web site or allow your domain name registration to expire, you will no longer be able to use and/or access your web hotel with us.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Email service:</b>
You agree not to use the email service to send unsolicited messages ("spam"), neither to private persons nor to companies/organizations.
You understand and acknowledge that Domainnameshop may filter email messages from/to your email addresses with us, in order to reduce the amount of spam messages going through our servers.
Domainnameshop takes no responsibility or liability for email that is delayed, rejected or incorrectly flagged as spam (false positives).
Neither do we take any responsibility or liability for unwanted messages that are delivered to your inbox without being flagged or rejected by our spam filter.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Content restrictions:</b>
You agree and warrant not to use our hosting services to distribute or promote pornographic, racist or obscene material, material that expresses religious or political extremism, material that harass or threaten third parties, or material that violates or infringes the intellectual property rights of others.
We also do not allow contents related to gambling or online pharmacies.
Domainnameshop reserves the right to, promptly and without prior notice, deactivate services and delete material that may fall under the above mentioned categories, or material that Domainnameshop considers to be objectionable, unethical or in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).
If in doubt whether the content you intend to distribute is within the boundaries of what we allow, please contact us for a clarification prior to publishing.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Security and confidentiality of hosting data:</b> All hosting services provided by Domainnameshop operate in a shared server environment, where multiple customers and users have login access to the same physical file and database resources.
It is your responsibility to make sure that the permissions on all your files and databases are set as restrictive as necessary in order to limit access only to the intended users or recipients, and that you are always using strong passwords that are hard to guess or crack.
If not, Domainnameshop cannot guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of your data, and you risk the possibility that unauthorized users may access your data.
Domainnameshop does not take any responsibility for a breach of security resulting out of your failure to set correct permissions or use strong passwords.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Limitation of bandwidth and system resources:</b> All our hosting services normally include unlimited traffic and free use of scripts and programs (CGI, PHP, etc.) on web hotels where this is enabled.
However, Domainnameshop reserves the right to temporarily or permanently restrict the available bandwidth in cases where a web hotel is using bandwidth to an extent that is endangering the security and stability of our systems.
Domainnameshop also reserves the right to, promptly and without prior notice, disable or delete scripts and programs that use system resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to an extent that is endangering the stability of Domainnameshop's servers, exceeds the limits and restrictions given in our FAQ, or if they contain security holes enabling non-authorized users access to resources on Domainnameshop's network.
Current recommended and/or enforced resource limits are listed in our FAQ:
<ul>
<li>PHP limits</li>
<li>Database (MySQL/MariaDB) limits</li>
<li>Unix shell limits</li>
<li>SMTP limits</li>
<li>Limits on outgoing email from web servers</li>
<li>Limits on newsletters and marketing email</li>
<li>List of software that we do not permit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<b>Data Processing Agreement:</b> If you decide to use our hosting services to store or transfer personal data, then it is your responsibility to make sure that you are complying with all applicable legislation relating to data protection and privacy, including the Norwegian <i>Personal Data Act (Personopplysningsloven)</i> and the European Union's <i>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</i>.
Examples of personal data include names, birth dates, postal addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, IP addresses or any other data that may be used directly or indirectly to identify natural persons.
By using our hosting services to store or process these types of data, you assume the role of a Data Controller, whereas Domainnameshop as the hosting provider becomes a Data Processor.
The relation between the Data Controller (you) and the Data Processor (us) is regulated through a Data Processing Agreement (DPA).
Our standard DPA is attached to this Agreement in Appendix 2.
Here we provide a high-level description of how we store and protect your hosting data.
Ultimately, you as the Data Controller must decide if the descriptions and warranties we give are sufficient for you to utilize our hosting services to store and process the types of personal data you intend to.</li>
<p>
</p>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<b>4.
Privacy Policy</b>
<p>In Domainnameshop we take your privacy seriously.
All personal data are collected, stored, processed, transferred and disposed of in accordance with the Norwegian <i>Personal Data Act (Personopplysningsloven)</i> and the European Union's <i>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</i>.
This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we process personal data.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Who we are and how to contact us:</b>
The entity responsible for collecting and processing personal data (the data controller) in relation to this Agreement is Domeneshop AS, a private limited liability company incorporated in Norway with registration number 976769678.
Our contact information is available on https://domainnameshop.com/contact.<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Personal data we collect from you:</b>
There are three categories of data we collect from you that may contain personal data:
<ol>
<li>
<b>Domain contact data</b>: Data you submit to us in order to identify the registrant, administrative contact and/or technical contact in relation to a domain name registration.
This includes name, address, phone number, fax number (optional) and email address.
In addition, birth date is collected if required by the applicable TLD.
National identification number is only collected for TLDs that require this, and only for citizens/residents of Sweden <i>(personnummer)</i>, Finland <i>(henkilötunnus)</i>, Italy <i>(codice fiscale)</i> and Spain <i>(NIF/NIE)</i>.
For Norwegian citizens/residents applying for a .no domain, the national identification number is collected and stored with the .no Registry Operator, Norid, and a PID number is issued in its place (see https://pid.norid.no/).
Domainnameshop only collects and processes this PID number, not the national identification number that it is linked to.</li>
<li>
<b>Customer contact data</b>: Data you submit to us in order to identify the Account Holder and/or billing contact in relation to a domain name registration or hosting service.
This includes name, address, phone number and email address(es).</li>
<li>
<b>Automatically collected data</b>: Data that you do not submit to us directly, but that are automatically gathered by our system when you or the users of your hosting services interact with our servers, pay invoices from us or contact our customer support.
This category includes web server access logs, email server logs, your list of email correspondents (address book) when using our webmail service, notifications of payments to our bank account, support history, and other automatically generated system logs.
Such logs may include timestamps, IP addresses, email addresses, bank account numbers, names, HTTP request headers and other data.
Our webpages also make use of cookies, which may be used to identify individual persons.
An explanation of how and why we use cookies is given in our FAQ.</li>
</ol>
Credit card information is not collected nor stored by us, but by our third party payment processor Nets Branch Norway.<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>How your personal data are used:</b>
Your domain contact data (category 1) are used by Domainnameshop and the Registry Operator to identify the holder and contact persons for a domain name.
The Registry Operator may publish the contact information, either partly or in full, in their WHOIS database, depending on their policy.
This is done in order to have a way to contact the person(s) responsible for the domain name, e.g.
in case of technical problems with the domain, if the domain is being abused for spam, fraud or criminal activities, or if a dispute over third party rights to the domain name should arise.
Additionally, we in Domainnameshop will use your contact data (category 1 and 2) to send you invoices, renewal notices, yearly reminders to keep your contact information up-to-date and other notifications, as needed to fulfill our contractual obligations with you and with ICANN and the Registry Operator.
Automatically collected data (category 3) may be used by Domainnameshop to maintain, protect and improve our services, to provide you with a better customer support experience, and to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>How you can access and update your personal data:</b>
You can access and update your contact data for your domains and for your account with us at any time from the control panel at https://domainnameshop.com/login.
Here you can also delete any information that is optional and not needed for the domain management process.
You may also subscribe to our email newsletter and control how you want us to send you invoices and notifications, e.g.
by postal mail, email or SMS.<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>How we share your personal data:</b>
We will share your domain contact data with the Registry Operator for the applicable TLD, as necessary to carry out the domain name registration and management process.
We may also share your domain contact data with third parties to fulfill our legal and contractual obligations with you, with ICANN and with the Registry Operator.
For example, we may share your contact data with the dispute resolution provider according to the applicable domain name dispute resolution policy.
In addition, for domain names that are under a gTLD, we are contractually obligated by ICANN to publish domain contact data in WHOIS and to deposit these data to the data escrow provider Iron Mountain on a weekly basis, as a backup measure in the unlikely event that the contact information is lost from the domain name registry if the Registry Operator goes bankrupt or is subject to unrecoverable technical failure and data loss.
We may also share personal data with third parties who have a legitimate interest for this, for example to enable domain name transfers, to initiate contact with the domain name registrant or account holder, to renew a domain that is about to expire, to give accountants, auditors and tax authorities access to information they need, or to investigate technical problems, potential trademark infringement or fraud and other criminal activities.
In addition, we may share personal data with Norwegian police or other public authorities if presented with a court order, seizure warrant or other equivalent request for disclosure of information.<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Transfer of personal data outside EU/EEA:</b>
Several Registry Operators and the data escrow provider that we transfer personal data to are located outside the European Union and the European Economic Area.
These include, among others, VeriSign (USA), Iron Mountain (USA), Neustar (Australia), Uniregistry (Cayman Islands), Radix Registry (Dubai) and GMO Registry (Japan).
When personal data are transferred between us and the Registry Operator or data escrow provider, the information is always encrypted using TLS encryption of the underlying data transfer protocol (EPP or FTP).<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Automatic processing and decision-making based on personal data:</b>
The personal data you submit to us are subject to a number of automatic checks, and data that do not pass the checks may be rejected or flagged for manual inspection before forwarding your information to the Registry Operator.
For example, we may check that the address is syntactically correct, that the zipcode matches the city/place name and that the country you have specified matches the country of your IP address.<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Dataportability:</b>
If you decide to transfer your domain name(s) away from us, all contact information relating to your domain(s) will still be present in the Registry Operator's central registry database in a standardized format, and can be automatically transferred to your new registrar of choice using the EPP registry-registrar protocol.<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>How long we keep your personal data:</b>
Personal data are kept for the duration of the term of the domain name registration service or hosting service and for at least 3 years after the termination of the service.
Personal data pertaining to invoices and payments are kept for at least 5 years for tax purposes, as required by Norwegian law.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Personal data processed as part of hosting services:</b>
Any personal data that you or your users submit, upload, send, store or process using the hosting services provided by Domainnameshop are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
This includes personal data that are uploaded to your web site, personal data that you store in files or in a database on Domainnameshop's servers, personal data that are sent by email to or from you, or any other personal data that you collect, store, transfer or process using our hosting services that are not explicitly requested by us for fulfillment of the domain name registration process or the services we provide to you.
Domainnameshop is not the data controller for such personal data, only data processor.
You as data controller are responsible for handling all such personal data in accordance with current privacy laws and regulations and, if needed, create and publish your own Privacy Policy that covers the personal data that you exchange with the users of your web site or with your email correspondents.
For details on how Domainnameshop processes and protects personal data as part of our hosting services, please refer to our Data Processing Agreement.<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Your right to complain:</b>
If you are a natural person residing in the European Union or European Economic Area and you believe that our use and processing of your personal data are not in compliance with the <i>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</i> or any other applicable legislation, you have the right to complain to the Supervisory Authority in either Norway <i>(Datatilsynet)</i> or in your country of domicile.<p>
</p>
</li>

<b>5.
Security measures and recommendations</b>
</p>
<p>As a long-standing hosting provider, Domainnameshop has employed a large variety of security measures, both technical and organisational, to protect the integrity and confidentiality of our customers' data.
To us, risk analysis and data protection is a continuous process.
For the sake of brevity, and for competitive and security reasons we cannot go into detail on every single security measure we have taken, we can only provide a high-level description of some of the hardware, software, procedures and practices we have in place to protect your data.
These include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical access control to hosting servers</li>
<li>Firewalls for intrusion detection and prevention</li>
<li>Redundant storage (RAID) and power supply (UPS)</li>
<li>Routine backup procedures with backup servers in a separate physical building (in case of fire)</li>
<li>Short response time for applying security updates (to prevent zero-day exploits)</li>
<li>Use of strong encryption when moving data between servers</li>
<li>Logging to detect and prevent security incidents and to provide audit trails</li>
<li>Disaster recovery planning and testing</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Any security system is only as strong as the weakest link.
In a shared server hosting environment like Domainnameshop's, simple user errors like setting wrong file permissions on a file may jeopardize the security of your data.
We must stress the importance of setting correct permissions on all your files and databases, as well as using strong passwords for your login accounts with us.
In the following are some additional security recommendations to help protect your data when using our hosting services.
</p>
<p>We recommend that if you are using our web hosting services to process personal data, then all web traffic should be encrypted using HTTPS instead of normal (unencrypted) HTTP.
We offer free HTTPS encryption with industry standard algorithms and certificates for all our web hosting packages, but you may have to turn it on yourself in the control panel.</p>
<p>Likewise, we recommend that, whenever technically possible, if you are transferring personal data to or from our hosting servers using the FTP protocol or reading email using POP or IMAP, that you use the encrypted (SSL/TLS enabled) variants of these protocols.
Domainnameshop supports both encrypted and unencrypted data transfer, but you yourself must make sure that the client software you are using has been configured to use SSL/TLS encryption.</p>
<p>If you store passwords, then we recommend that, whenever technically possible, these are stored in an encrypted or hashed form instead of in cleartext.</p>
<p>We do <i>not</i> recommend that you use Domainnameshop's shared server hosting environment to process sensitive personal data.
Sensitive personal data includes information about racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
For such data we recommend a dedicated server or virtual private server (VPS) instead.
Domainnameshop does not offer these kinds of services.</p>
