How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technology to Collect Information

We use this information to enhance and personalize your user experience, to recognize and contact you, and to monitor and improve our websites and Service.
In some instances, we and our third-party service providers may combine this usage information with personal information.
If we do combine any usage information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information hereunder (as long as it is so combined).</p>
<p>We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, ”<strong>tracking technologies</strong>”).
We, and our third-party partners, use tracking technologies to automatically collect usage and device information, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<u>Information about your device and its software</u>, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system, date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or your account (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other such information.
We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Information about the way you access and use our Service</u>, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our Service, the pages you visit, the links you click, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Service from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service.</p>

</li>

<p>
<u>Analytics information</u>.
We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics of our users.
You can learn more about Google’s practices at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners and view its currently available opt-out options at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
<p>We also use pixel tags to collect IP addresses, which may then be used to derive insights from web traffic.</p>
<p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i)&nbsp;change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it.
(ii)&nbsp;disable existing cookies.
or (iii)&nbsp;set your browser to automatically reject cookies.
however, doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly.

Third-Party Tracking and Online Advertising
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<u>Interest-Based Advertising</u>.
We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history.
We may share or we may permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may display ads on our Service, on other devices you may use, and on other websites, apps, or services, including on Facebook.
Typically, though not always, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, and other information.
We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Social Media Widgets and Advertising</u>.
Our Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, or other widgets.
These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Service, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies.
Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.</p>
<p>We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others.
These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service while those users are on the social media platform or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics.
These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Cross-Device Linking</u>.
We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device.
We do this by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service.
We may also work with third-party partners who employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household.
We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with third-party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices.
We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Google Analytics and Advertising</u>.
We utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.
These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Service.
You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at https://google.com/ads/preferences, or by visiting NAI’s online resources at https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Your Choices</u>:</p>
<p>(a) <u>Cookies</u>.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers allow you to adjust your browser settings to: (i)&nbsp;notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it.
(ii)&nbsp;disable existing cookies.
or (iii)&nbsp;set your browser to automatically reject cookies.</p>
<code>Blocking or deleting cookies may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly.
Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.</code>
<p>(b) <u>Interest-based advertising</u>.
To learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) online resources at https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) resources at www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
<p>(c) <u>Cross-device linking</u>.
Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s and DAA’s online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices.
You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.</p>
<p>(d) <u>Mobile advertising</u>.
You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android).
You may also be able to opt-out of some — but not all — interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting https://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies.
If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.
Please also note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online services.
It means that the online ads that you do see from the DAA and NAI program participants should not be based on your interests.
We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under each program’s governing principles.</p>
