Once we receive and confirm your verifiable CA User request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our (their) records, unless an exception applies.
<em>provided, however, </em>that in some cases, strictly for regulatory compliance purposes and to better evidence/honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests (and for no other purposes), we may retain certain items of your personal information on a de-identified and aggregated basis in such a manner that the data no longer identifies you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>

<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with CA User expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>

<p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable CA User request related to your personal information.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable CA User request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

or (2) an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.&nbsp.
Making a verifiable CA User request does not require you to create an account with us.&nbsp.

<p>
<em>Response Timing and Format</em>
</p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to all verifiable CA User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt thereof.&nbsp.
If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.&nbsp.
We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.&nbsp.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable request.&nbsp.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.&nbsp.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CA User request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.&nbsp.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
