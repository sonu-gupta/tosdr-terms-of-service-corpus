<p>
<strong>What is Personalized Content &amp.
Advertising?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Analytics</em>
</p>
<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics.&nbsp;These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Cookies and other electronic technologies” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you.
For example, the Google Trusted Store badge displayed on some of the Services is served to you through the use of cookies.
The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services.&nbsp;We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section.
To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by&nbsp;clicking here.</p>
<p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.&nbsp;This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Tailored Advertising</p>
<p>We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use.
The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you.
These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>In connection with the foregoing, we may work with DigiTrust to set a first-party cookie in your browser to enable us and&nbsp;DigiTrust&nbsp;Partners&nbsp;to collect web viewing data that includes visits to the Services and non-affiliated websites over time.
This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services.
We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.
We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the services (e.g., user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising.
We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties.
Those parties that use these technologies, including DigiTrust, may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.
If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link&nbsp;, the&nbsp;opt-out page of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, or&nbsp;TrustArc’s Preference Manager&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.
You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through the Services.</p>
<p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the&nbsp;Google Ads Settings page.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.
In that case, the ads will just not be tailored.</p>
<p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements.
Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.
For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.
We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements.
thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.
We also may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics.&nbsp;You can opt-out from third-party interest-based advertising on some Android devices and Google apps by visiting Google Settings, Ads and then click on ‘Disable ads based on interests.’&nbsp;You can also opt out of some interest-based advertising on your mobile device by downloading the TrustArc Privacy App available at:&nbsp;https://www.trustarc.com/consumer-resources/privacy-app/.</p>
<p>Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out.
n that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests.
Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.&nbsp.
We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
DNT is a way for users to inform online services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or services.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide links to the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance&nbsp;opt-out pages, as well as choices provided by Google Ads, Google Analytics, and TrustArc.
However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so&nbsp;here</p>
<p>

<strong>Third Party Links and Services</strong>
</p>
<p>Please note that XDA Developers makes use of a system called VigLink in order to change links to certain online retailers being displayed on the site to include an affiliate marketing tag.
This tag permits those online retailers to know that a user clicking those links has been referred by our site so that we may receive a commission on certain sales.
VigLink and other online referral software programs are commonly used across the Internet, though if you have a problem with this practice, we urge you to turn off VigLink.</p>
