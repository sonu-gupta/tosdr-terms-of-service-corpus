THESE LIMITATIONS AND LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RECOMPENSE.</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES IS LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES IN THE ONE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES ANY AMOUNT IN THE ONE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EACH OF KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES’ LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

<strong>Attempt at Informal Resolution.</strong> In the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, the performance or the validity of the Agreement, we hope to resolve quickly and reach an amicable solution with you before any legal action.
You can file your complaint at support@kongregate.com, and we will make reasonable and good faith efforts to respond to such claims within 14 days.
If, however, the matter is not resolved in a timely manner and you live in the EU, you may submit your legal claims to the online dispute resolution platform operated and provide by the European Commission which can be accessed at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&amp;lng=EN to reach an out of court settlement or initiate a lawsuit.
For non-EU residents, the following provisions shall apply.</p>

<strong>Arbitration for Less than $10,000.</strong> For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000 USD, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.
The party electing such arbitration will initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (<strong>“ADR”</strong>) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties.
The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration.
(ii) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
