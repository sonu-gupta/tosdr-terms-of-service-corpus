5.
Children
<p>We take steps to ensure that appropriate content is made available to children who use ABC Online Services.
For example, when a sub-profile is created for a child on ABC iview, the ABC will make available content that is suitable for their age group.
It is important for parents and guardians to monitor and participate in their children’s use of ABC Online Services to protect their safety and prevent access to inappropriate content.</p>
<p>When contributions are sought from, likely to have been submitted by, or include children and/or young people (under 18), the ABC will, where appropriate, seek the consent of a child’s parent or guardian before using a child’s contribution on ABC platforms.</p>
<p>You must not create a sub-profile for a child on iview unless consent to these terms is in place in relation to the child.&nbsp.
If you are the parent or guardian of the child, you must only create a sub-profile for the child if you consent on the child’s behalf, and (if the child is old enough to consent) you have also confirmed that the child consents.&nbsp.
If you are not the parent or guardian of the child, you must ensure that a parent or guardian of the child has taken those steps.&nbsp;&nbsp.
The ABC will proceed on the basis that by creating a profile for a child you confirm that you have ensured that consent in in place in relation to that child.</p>
<p>Parents seeking appropriate content for young children and advice regarding information regarding online safety can find the ABC’s children’s online destinations at&nbsp;www.abc.net.au/children/.</p>
