<em>updated 2/16/2022</em>
</p>
<p>The internet is full of wonder and adventure, it's also the internet though: all kinds of experiences can be had here.
With that in mind, good behaviour and kindness will make a world of difference on Odysee.</p>
<p>Here are some Community Guidelines that will help make Odysee a welcoming and rewarding place.</p>
<ol>
<li>You must be at least 13 years old to use Odysee.</li>
<li>You're responsible for the content and posts made under your channel/handle.</li>
<li>You're responsible for keeping your password and wallet safe.

<li>Don't spam other users repeatedly with messages/links etc.</li>
<li>Don't use Odysee for illegal activities, this includes sharing illegal or copyright-infringing content.<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t use Odysee to dox individuals, users or otherwise.</li>

<li>
<p>Self harm content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copyright-infringing material</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Addtionally:</p>
<p>Because we are not in a position to adjudicate the truthfulness of postings, <strong>we do not remove video postings due to allegations of defamation.</strong> Consistent with Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act, we recommend that you pursue any claims you may have directly against the person who posted the content.</p>Comment Section Rules​<p>Every rule listed above applies to both channel content, as well as to comments.
</p>
<p>In addition, for comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use multiple channels to manipulate voting.</li>
<li>Don’t use multiple channels or accounts to pretend to be different people in the same comment section or live chat.</li>
<li>Don’t create multiple channels to circumvent channel restrictions.</li>
<li>Don’t be overly nasty to creators and other users.
It reflects poorly on the Odysee community and turns new people away.</li>
<li>Don’t spam.
Examples include: self-promotion, external links, word spam, sticker spam, and comment spamming.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<em>Pro tip:</em> We understand that there’s no such thing as a one size fits all approach to moderation, so we encourage our users to take advantage of additional moderation tools available to them and shape their experience on Odysee in a way that aligns with their personal values.

Did you ever consider that maybe you’re the bad guy(s)?
Please don’t break our community guidelines - not only do your actions on Odysee reflect poorly on the community, it also makes Odysee look bad.
</p>
<p>If you do break any of the community guidelines, we reserve the right to do any or more of the following:</p>
<p>
<strong>For breaching community trust:</strong>
We will request for immediate removal.
We will move forward with removal in circumstances where the creator or user is unable to.</p>

<ul>
<li>Filtering of your channel from Odysee.</li>
<li>Restricting your ability to comment, either temporarily or permanently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Attempts to circumvent these restrictions by way of creating new channels/accounts to release the same content will be treated as a repeated breach of community guidelines.</p>
<p>
<strong>Redemption, because we don’t believe in eternal damnation:</strong>
</p>
<p>If you regain community trust and demonstrate willingness to follow our community guidelines, we may:
i.
Lift restrictions applied to your account/channel</p>
