Backup and Restore runs when your Fire tablet is idle and connected to Wi-Fi, so please connect your Fire tablet to Wi-Fi on a regular basis.
Backup data can be used to quickly set up a new device or to restore your existing device after a reset.
We'll expand this feature over time so that additional items are backed up.</p> How is my backup data stored? <p>Backup data is encrypted and stored in the Cloud.
Backup data can be used to help you easily set up a new device or restore data to your existing device after a reset.
