An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web.

Cookies allow us to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences.
Cookies are used by Autism Speaks to measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not.
We will make available cookies, containing non-personally identifiable information such as IP address and pages viewed, regarding your activity on the Site to certain third party providers with whom we work, in order to show advertisements relating to this Site that may be of interest to you.
