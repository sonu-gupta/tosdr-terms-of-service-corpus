<p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information.
This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to Access/Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.
You may request to know only the categories of personal information or the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.

<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>

and</li>
<li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a 12-month period.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to Request Deletion.</strong> You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p>
<strong>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights.</strong> To exercise the access or deletion rights described above, a verifiable consumer request can be made to us by either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dial 1-855-327-6548 Monday to Friday from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
Pacific time.
The representative will collect information from you for verification and to initiate your request.</li>
<li>Submit a request through our CCPA Web Form.
Within three to five business days of receipt of your request, a representative will call you at the number you provide in order to collect any additional information from you necessary for verification and to initiate your request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional information will be required for verification purposes.
The specific elements may vary depending on the nature of your relationship with us but will begin with name, address, phone number and date of birth.
These elements will be matched with data in our systems.
Only you, or an authorized agent, may make a request related to your personal information.
You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you designate an Authorized Agent to act on your behalf with regard to a request to know or delete, you must provide us with a notarized affidavit.
A sample affidavit is available for download from the CCPA Web Form.
Alternatively, a valid power of attorney may be provided.
Responses to requests for access will be provided directly to the consumer.</li>
<li>You may make a request to know the categories of information or specific pieces of information.
For requests that seek the disclosure of specific pieces information, you may be asked to complete and provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer who is the subject of the request.
A sample declaration is available for download from the CCPA Web Form.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are unable to verify you based on the information you have provided and the information in our systems, we will advise you that we cannot complete your request based on an inability to verify you.</p>Do Not Sell My Personal Information/Notice of Right to Opt Out<p>Under CCPA, the sale of your personal information means the sharing of your personal information with certain third parties.
Under CCPA, consumers have the right to direct a business that sells personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer’s personal information.
Currently, we do not share your personal information in a manner that would be considered a sale under CCPA.
We only disclose your personal information in a manner consistent with applicable federal law or to our service providers pursuant to contracts that prohibit the service provider from using your personal information for any purpose other than those services specified in the contract.
If, in the future, we share your information in a manner that will be considered a sale under CCPA, this privacy notice will be updated.</p>
<p>Although we do not currently share personal information in a manner that would be considered a sale under CCPA, you may still submit a request to opt out.
You may do so through either of the following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dial 1-855-327-6548 Monday to Friday from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
Pacific time.
The representative will collect information from you for verification and to initiate your request.</li>
<li>Submit a request through our CCPA Web Form.
Within three to five business days of receipt of your request, a representative will call you at the number you provide in order to collect any additional information from you necessary for verification and to initiate your request.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also designate another person or business entity registered with the Secretary of State (“Authorized Agent”) to act on your behalf with regard to the right to opt-out.
You must provide the Authorized Agent written permission to do so.
One way to do so is to provide us with a notarized affidavit.
A sample affidavit is available for download from the CCPA Web Form.</p>
<p>
<strong>Request to Opt-In.</strong> If you would like to opt in after opting out of the sale of personal information, you may do so through either of the following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dial 1-855-327-6548 Monday to Friday from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
Pacific time.
The representative will collect information from you for verification and to initiate your request.</li>
<li>Submit a request through our CCPA Web Form.
Within three to five business days of receipt of your request, a representative will call you at the number you provide in order to collect any additional information from you necessary for verification and to initiate your request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, we do not and will not share the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.
However, if you are the parent or guardian of a consumer who is a minor under 13 years of age, you may opt-in for the sale of the minor’s information by providing a consent form to us that is signed under penalty of perjury.
A sample form can be found on the CCPA Web Form.
Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>
<p>
<strong>Response Timing and Format.</strong> We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.
If we require more time (up to an additional 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
We will deliver our written response by mail.</p>
<p>Disclosures we provide may only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p>
<p>
<strong>Non-Discrimination.</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.</p>
