<p>
<u>Purpose of the processing operation</u>: The European Commission's Identity &amp.
Access Management Service (IAMS) provides a common way for individuals to register or be registered for access to a number of different Commission information systems or services.<br> EC DIGIT D3 collects and uses your personal information to manage user populations and their rights in the context of IT systems.
The main purpose is to ensure the appropriate level of security is applied in a consistent fashion across Commission IT services with the ability to identify the user of the service, authenticate that user, and / or determine his or her authorisations and roles within the context of their service.
The IAMS allows not only the authentication of individual that have an employment relationship with EU Institutions (EU Staff), but also self-registered individuals can create an EU-login account worldwide.
</p>

WHICH PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT AND FURTHER PROCESS?
<p> In order to carry out this processing operation EC DIGIT D3 collects the following categories of personal data:
</p>
<p> For EU Institutions staff, IAMS is processing only identification data (to identify the individuals):</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal information:<ul>
<li>first, middle and last name(s) as provided by the HR Systems,</li>
<li>date of birth</li>
<li>personal title</li>
<li>history of changes in the name</li>
<li>an unique number per EU Institution, Agency or Body attributed by the HR System of each entity (Personal Number)</li>
<li>an unique identification number in attributed by the Commission HR System (Per_ID)</li>
</ul>
<br>Based on the above, IAMS generates a unique:<ul>
<li>username or account (based on specific rules)</li>
<li>e-mail address (based on specific rules)</li>
</ul>
<br>IAMS keeps a history of:<ul>
<li>name changes (not to create multiple identities for the same individual)</li>
<li>password changes (to enforce regular changes (passwords are irreversibly encrypted))</li>
<li>last authentication and authenticated account activity (Date and time of the most recent successful and unsuccessful authentication and number of good logins and failed attempts)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>This additional information is used to diagnose and resolve problems and to deal with security incidents as well as to avoid duplicated accounts.
This information can help in following up any doubtful/malicious activity relating to your user account.<ul>
<li>Administrative data (to identify the relationship with the organization):<ul>
<li>the entity where the individual is assigned</li>
<li>the job title</li>
<li>the job status</li>
<li>information related to the start and end of the contract</li>
<li>office address and phone number</li>
<li>mobile phone number (for two-factor authentication, when available into the HR System)</li>
</ul>
<br>Based on the above and on the HR "basic entitlements policy", IAMS generates:<ul>
<li>access rights - information about group membership (for granting access to the intended systems)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<b>For self-registered individuals, IAMS is processing only identification data.</b>
<ul>
<li>Personal information (as provided by the individual during self-registration):<ul>
<li>first, middle and last name(s)</li>
<li>e-mail address</li>
<li>username</li>
<li>mobile number, when provided for two-factor authentication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p> For the two-factor authentication using the EU Login mobile app, the Operating System software of the mobile device is stored as well.
</p>
<p> Alternatively, self-registered users may choose to authenticate using their social network credentials (like Facebook, Twitter, and Google) or the eID.
In this case, only the Social-media/eID identifier is required.
The individual may decide to provide additional information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, last name</li>
<li>e-mail address</li>
</ul>Please note that if you choose this option, we would recommend you also read the privacy statements/notices of the related social network, since they are also applicable.
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Log files for both user categories</b>
</p>
<p> Each time the user logs in to a site protected by EU Login, the identifier, the site and the time will be recorded in a log file.
The exact time of log-out will also be recorded for security purposes.
</p>
<p> The provision of personal data is mandatory to meet access requirement to the European Commission IT Systems.
If you do not provide your personal data, the consequence is that you will not be able to get access to the mentioned IT systems.
</p>
<p> We have obtained your personal data either from the HR system of your EU Institution, Agency or Body for the EU Institutions staff, or directly from the data subject for the self-registered individuals.

HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

</p>
<p> Data related to the European Institutions Staff are kept for as long as the user has a relationship with the European Commission.
<br>However, the user's identifier (userid), personnel number, first/last name, and, to prevent errors, date of birth are retained for a longer period in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow the reuse of the identifier, if appropriate, should the person require renewed access to Commission IT resources after a long absence or for assuming his/her rights for example while in retirement,</li>
<li>to determine the real global identity of a user and prevent duplication of entries.</li>
</ul>
<br>For other EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies, the above-mentioned data, will be limited to the information provided by each one of them according to their Human Resources policy.
<p>
</p>
<p> Data related to self-registered individuals are kept until the user personally deletes his/her EU-Login account or requests the deletion by our Unit, with the exception of e-mail addresses that need to be kept for further user support and assistance.
</p>
<p> History of identity changes for the European Institutions staff is kept for as long as the user is active.
However, the most recent entries of this data category should be kept longer to prevent duplication of entries and ensure security.
</p>
<p> Log files are kept for 6 months.
</p>
