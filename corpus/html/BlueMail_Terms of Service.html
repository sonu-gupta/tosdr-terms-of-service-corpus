<p>Amicable dispute resolution: For any dispute with Blix Inc., you agree to first contact us at privacy@bluemail.me and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
In the unlikely event that Blix Inc.
has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Blix Inc.
claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.
The arbitration will be conducted in New York, NY, unless you and Blix Inc.
agree otherwise.
Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.
The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights.
All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims.

<p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Blix Inc with respect to BlueMail, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to BlueMail.
These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
Blix Inc.’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but may be assigned by Blix Inc.
without restriction.
