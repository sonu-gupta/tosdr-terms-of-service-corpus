         Plausible Analytics Privacy Policy <p>
<strong>TL;DR:</strong> For plausible.io visitors, we do not use cookies and we do not collect any personal data.
If you decide to create an account, we ask for the bare minimum and only share it with services that are absolutely necessary for the app to function.</p>
<p>At Plausible Analytics, we are committed to complying with GDPR, CCPA, PECR and other privacy regulations on our website and on our web analytics product too.
The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us.</p>
<p>In this policy, we lay out what data we collect and why, how your data is handled and your rights to your data.
We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.</p>
<p>If you have placed the Plausible Analytics script on your website, take a look at our data policy for details on the information we do collect about your website visitors on your behalf.</p> As a visitor to the plausible.io website <p>The privacy of our website visitors is important to us so we do not track any individual people.
