contrary to applicable law (“<strong>Excluded Disputes</strong>”), you hereby agree that all disputes between you and us (whether<br>
or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with us, including without limitation<br>

discretion, be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s rules for<br>
arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you hereby expressly waive trial by jury.

bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules.

claims only on your own behalf.
You agree that you shall not participate in any class action or class-wide<br>
arbitration for any claims covered by this&nbsp;Agreement.

private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if<br>
we are a party to the proceeding.
This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the US Federal Arbitration<br>
Act, to the extent permissible.
In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a<br>
hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the<br>
arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.
Judgment on the award rendered<br>
by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
Any provision of applicable law<br>
notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with<br>
these Terms of Use.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate.
If you do so, neither you nor&nbsp;we&nbsp;can require<br>
the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of<br>
the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.
You must use this address to opt-out:<br>
legal@represent.com.
You must include your name and residence address, the email<br>
address you use for your account with us, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration<br>
agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;If and to the extent the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third<br>
parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then such preceding language in this Arbitration section will<br>
be null and void.
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.
