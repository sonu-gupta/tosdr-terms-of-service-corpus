<p>ðŸ‘‹ I'm an entrepreneur and software engineer.
I work with startups and innovative companies to build great products that delight users.</p>
<p>By day I'm a full-stack engineer at Lambda School.
By night, I'm a dad, husband, Latter-day Saint, and co-founder at Coriaria where we develop products and services that strengthen homes and families.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I use Lean Startup techniques to quickly get to the root of the job to be done so that we can get value to customers as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As an engineer, I specialize in full-stack web and mobile applications engineering using React &amp.
React Native, Postgres, iOS/Swift, Elixir, and NodeJS.
I also help teams build the best process for rapid innovation across the stack.</p>
<p>My playbook is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start small and iterate</li>
<li>Focus on people and their needs</li>
<li>Help others become more excellent</li>
</ol>
<p>With this playbook I have helped tiny early-stage startups, fortune 100 companies, and global brands achieve success.</p>
