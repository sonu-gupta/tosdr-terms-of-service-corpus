</i> Cookies Policy <p> What are cookies and how do we use them</p>
<p>Like most websites you visit, our website uses cookies and other similar technologies to distinguish you from other users of our website.
This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website (such as storing and managing user preferences) and to improve the services we provide to you.
Our website also uses cookies to deliver targeted advertising, enable functions of the website, and gather analytic and user data.
By using our website (through any device) you agree that this Cookies Policy, together with our Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, applies to your use.</p>
<p> Cookies and related technologies</p>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website.
Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie.
Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device and to remember your actions and preferences (such as login details, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time.
<br>
<br>
Web beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs) are a similar technology which typically uses transparent graphic images placed on a site to gather information about a user.
Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to measure the actions of visitors on websites.
We make use of both cookies and web beacons when you visit our website, and refer to the technologies together as “cookies” throughout this policy.</p>
<p> First and Third Party Cookies</p>
<p>Cookies can be ‘first party’ or ‘third party’, depending on the website or domain placing the cookie.
On our website, first party cookies are cookies set by viagogo and information is collected and used by viagogo, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a company other than viagogo, and information collected is controlled by that other company.
For more information on third party cookies used by viagogo, see the ‘”analytical cookies” and “advertising cookies” sections below.
<br>
<br>
We use cookies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent).
You are free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your device allows this, although please be aware that if you do, some of the functionality of our website will be lost.
You can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.
<br>
<br>
We rely on your consent to use first and third party cookies (except “strictly necessary cookies”, as described below).
You can refuse cookies at any time by changing your settings while entering a website or changing the cookie settings in your browser.
<br>
<br>
You can find more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, at www.aboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.eu </p>

<p> Types of cookies used on this site</p>
<p>There are different types of cookies, and these different kinds of cookies serve different purposes for viagogo and the third parties who place cookies on our site.
Although these cookies mainly work in the same way there are some differences, and we’ve set out below the four categories of cookies we use on our website.
<br>

<br>
<li>
<b>Analytical/performance cookies.</b> These cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it, including items that have been clicked on and the individual pages viewed.

<b>Advertising cookies.</b> We allow third parties such as Google and Doubleclick by Google to place cookies on your device in order to show you online advertising on other (non-viagogo) websites that you visit.
These third parties will collect information about you (such as pages you have viewed and events you may be interested in) in order to select and serve relevant adverts to you.
The information collected by these advertising cookies will be controlled by the relevant third party and will not be provided to viagogo (except as part of statistical information we receive).
