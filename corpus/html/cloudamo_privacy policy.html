Plugins and tools

When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p>

Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address.
The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website.
This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art.
6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p>
<p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</p>
