<p>Any analysis and estimates we provide as part of our Services are for illustrative and informational purposes only.
Our analysis and estimates are based on certain assumptions and use only the data we have.
Our analysis and estimates are neither endorsed by, nor commissioned by, any of our partners.
The methodology we use to determine which offers, analysis, or other information is presented or highlighted is proprietary and we may elect to consider, ignore, emphasize, or de-emphasize certain factors in our sole and absolute discretion.</p>

Summary
<p>The credit scores that lenders and others use may be different than the one you see here.
That’s because there are hundreds of scoring models out there, and they all weigh things a little differently.
Most scores are generally based on similar credit factors though, so tracking one or two should still give you a good overview of your credit health.</p>

Use of our Services is not a replacement for personal, professional advice or assistance regarding your finances, credit history or fixing your credit rating.</p>

10.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
Summary
<p>A third party arbitrator will help us resolve any disputes we might have.
This means that any dispute will be resolved outside of class-action litigation.
Hopefully, disputes will never be an issue, but you should read this section carefully for details on how it works.</p>
10.1 Generally
<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Credit Karma in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Credit Karma agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with the Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.
You and us further agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.
the arbitrator shall apply California law to all other matters.
Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
&nbsp;All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of the Agreement.
The arbitrator also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AND CREDIT KARMA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.</strong>
</p>
10.2 Exceptions
<p>Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, you and us both agree that nothing in the Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court within its jurisdictional limits under Consumer Arbitration Rule 9(b), even after filing an arbitration.
(b) file a complaint with the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.
(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of a pending arbitration.
or (d) to file a suit in a court of law solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of our Services or address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
10.3 Arbitrator
<p>Any arbitration between you and Credit Karma will be conducted under the Consumer Arbitration Rules (“<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>“), as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Credit Karma here.</p>
10.4 Notice and Process
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other by certified mail (“<strong>Notice</strong>“).
Credit Karma’s address for Notice is: Credit Karma, LLC, P.O.
Box 30963, Oakland, CA 94604, Attention: Legal Department.
The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>“).
You and Credit Karma agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Credit Karma do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Credit Karma must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
The arbitration proceedings, including any exchanged materials, shall be confidential and you and Credit Karma agree to use reasonable efforts to streamline the proceedings, including discovery, consistent with the objectives of efficient dispute resolution.</p>
10.5 Fees
<p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, Credit Karma will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, or as otherwise required, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.
or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your registered account address.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.&nbsp.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, you agree to reimburse Credit Karma for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Likewise, Credit Karma will not seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgement on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
10.6 No Class Actions
<p>
<strong>YOU AND CREDIT KARMA AGREE THAT EACH MUST BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
</strong>
</p>
