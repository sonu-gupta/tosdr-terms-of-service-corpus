IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THESE TERMS, UBIQUITI IS FOUND TO BE LIABLE, THE LIABILITY OF UBIQUITI AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY IS LIMITED TO THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO UBIQUITI FOR THE SERVICES OR PRODUCT AT ISSUE IN THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS.
THIS LIMITATION IS CUMULATIVE AND WILL NOT BE INCREASED BY THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE INCIDENT OR CLAIM.
</li>
<li> Exclusions and Limitations.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages.
Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to You.
To the extent that Ubiquiti may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of Ubiquiti’s liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Indemnification.
YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS UBIQUITI AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES AND FEES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES) THAT SUCH PARTIES MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF OR ARISING FROM A VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS BY YOU OR ANY AUTHORIZED USER’S ACCESS TO THE SERVICES.
YOU AGREE NOT TO SETTLE ANY SUCH CLAIM WITHOUT UBIQUITI’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT.
UBIQUITI RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ITS OWN EXPENSE, TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY MATTER OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION BY YOU, AND IN SUCH CASE, YOU AGREE TO COOPERATE WITH UBIQUITI’S DEFENSE OF SUCH CLAIM.
</li>
<li> Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
<ul>
<li> MANDATORY ARBITRATION.
Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons having a dispute agree to waive their right to file a lawsuit to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead agree to present their dispute to a neutral third party (arbitrator) for binding decision.
You have the right to opt-out of this provision which means that You retain Your right to file a lawsuit.
to do so, You must read carefully and follow the directions under Section (IX)(b).
Unless You Opt Out of the Mandatory Arbitration, You will be understood to have agreed to the mandatory arbitration and to the provisions provided below.
<ul>
<li> Please read this carefully.
It affects Your rights.
YOU AND UBIQUITI AND ITS RESPECTIVE CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, PERMITTED ASSIGNS, AND ANY OTHER PARTIES ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SERVICES AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED BELOW.
THE TERM “DISPUTE” MEANS ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY NOW OR IN THE FUTURE BETWEEN YOU AND UBIQUITI WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT, OR NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND INCLUDING THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR SCOPE OF THIS PROVISION (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER CLAUSE BELOW) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND/OR USE OF THE SERVICE AND/OR THE TERMS ACCOMPANYING THAT SERVICE.
FOR EACH SERVICE USED, ACCESSED OR DOWNLOADED, THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WOULD APPLY UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT- OUT AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.
“Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral, third-person arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Please visit https://www.iccwbo.org for more information.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> How to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration.
Notwithstanding the above, You or Ubiquiti may choose to file a lawsuit in court rather than resolving Your Dispute by arbitration.
You may opt-out of mandatory arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies for small claims court (there are monetary limitations for small claims court), or (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).
In order to opt out of mandatory arbitration, You need to (I) mail written notification to Ubiquiti Inc., Legal Department, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017.
or (II) email written notification to legal@ui.com.
In either case, Your written notification must include: (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) a copy of Your receipt or other proof of purchase, showing the date of purchase, and (4) a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Ubiquiti through arbitration.
Your decision to opt-out of this provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Ubiquiti.
Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your Dispute in arbitration or, if the dispute qualifies, in small claims court.
</li>
<li> Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution: For all disputes, whether pursued in court or in mandatory arbitration, You must first give Ubiquiti written notification and forty-five (45) days to resolve the Dispute.
The written notification shall include the information listed above in the preceding Section IX(b) items (1) -(3) plus (4) a written description of Your Dispute and (5) a written description of the relief You seek (“Demand Information”).
It is to be sent to Ubiquiti Inc., Legal Department, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017.
If Ubiquiti does not resolve the dispute within 45 days, You may pursue Your dispute in arbitration.
You may pursue Your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described above in Section IX(b), the Opt Out provision.
</li>
<li> Arbitration Process.
<ul>
<li> Commencing Arbitration.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by a reputable courier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by You to Ubiquiti, then Ubiquiti can send to You by any other method available to Ubiquiti for sending such notice, including via e-mail.
The Notice to Ubiquiti should be addressed to Ubiquiti Inc., Legal Department, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017 (the “Arbitration Notice Address”).
The Notice shall include the Demand Information (the “Demand”).
THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION (“ICDR”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION RULES (THE “RULES”), AS MODIFIED HEREIN.
The Rules are available at https://www.icdr.org.
Except as otherwise set forth herein, if You are required to pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against Ubiquiti, then Ubiquiti will, within ten (10) business days of receipt of Your confirmed payment of the filing fee, reimburse You for the amount of Your confirmed payment of the filing fee that exceeds the amount of any fees You would be required to pay if the Demand were filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York.
</li>
<li> Arbitration Proceeding.
The arbitration will be conducted in English and a translator may be utilized as the expense of the party requiring the translation services.
A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in New York, New York will be appointed pursuant to the Rules.
You and Ubiquiti agree to the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (a) subject to the Rules, the arbitration shall be conducted online via videoconference, telephonically and/or be solely based on written submissions-rather than requiring the personal appearance of the parties-with the specific manner to be mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties and (b) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</li>
<li> No Class Actions.
YOU AND UBIQUITI AGREE THAT YOU AND UBIQUITI MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.
IF YOU CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR DISPUTE IN COURT BY OPTING OUT OF THIS PROVISION, AS SPECIFIED ABOVE, THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU.
NEITHER YOU, NOR ANY OTHER USER OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICES CAN BE A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING WITHOUT HAVING COMPLIED WITH THE OPT-OUT REQUIREMENTS ABOVE.
</li>
<li> Decision of the Arbitrator.
Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within one-hundred and twenty (120) days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.
The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional thirty (30) days in the interests of justice upon written notice by the arbitrator to You and Ubiquiti at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the last date to issue his or her decision.
Failure to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis for challenging the arbitration award.
All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.
The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.
The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of New York in conducting the arbitration.
You acknowledge that these Terms and Your use of any Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in these Terms.
</li>
<li> Arbitration Award.
The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against, or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.
Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, and may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Equitable Relief.
Punitive Damages.
<ul>
<li> You acknowledge that, in the event Ubiquiti or a third party breaches these Terms, the damage or harm, if any, caused to You will not entitle You to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Ubiquiti, and Your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.
</li>
<li> You and Ubiquiti agree that the arbitrator is not authorized to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these terms.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Jury Waiver.
You understand and agree that by failing to opt out to the Mandatory Arbitration provision in Sections IX(a)-(g), You and Ubiquiti are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in public court.
In the absence of this provision, You and Ubiquiti might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in court, before a judge or jury and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).
Except as otherwise provided herein, those rights are waived.
</li>
<li> Enforceability.
If only Section IX(d)(iii) or the entirety of Sections IX(a)-(g) are found to be unenforceable, then Sections (IX)(a)-(g) will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section IX(h) and Section (IX)(i) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
</li>
<li> Governing Law.
These Terms shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof or the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods).
</li>
<li> Jurisdiction.
The parties agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the courts of New York, county and city of Manhattan, or the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in Sections IX(a)-(g).
Both You and Ubiquiti consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.
provided, however, that Ubiquiti reserves the right to institute proceedings against You in the courts having jurisdiction in the places where You reside, do business, have assets, or in any jurisdiction where a harm to Ubiquiti is occurring or has occurred.
In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorney’s fees.
Notwithstanding anything herein (including the mandatory arbitration provision above in Sections IX(a)-(g)), in the event You infringe or misappropriate any of Intellectual Property Rights, Ubiquiti is entitled to seek any permanent or temporary remedies (including, without limitation, compensation for damages, ceasing of infringement act, injunctive reliefs) against You in accordance with the applicable laws of Your resident country or the jurisdiction where such infringing act has transpired.
