Our reasons for using your information üîç
<p>Data protection laws say we need to have a lawful basis for using your personal data.
At least one of the following must apply: contractual or legal duty, legitimate interest, public interest, vital individual interest or consent.
In this section we explain which one we rely on to use your data in a certain way.</p>

<ul>
<li>consider your application</li>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>When it‚Äôs in our ‚Äòlegitimate interest‚Äô</strong>.
We need to use your data for our legitimate interests, or those of a third party.
This means using data in a way that you might expect us to, for a reason which is in your and/or our (or a third party‚Äôs) interest and which doesn't involve overriding your privacy rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>Product development and marketing</strong>
</p>
<p>We:</p>
<ul>
<li>check your record at credit reference agencies when you sign up to see if we can offer you an overdraft or a loan (this is a soft check)</li>
<li>tell you about products and services through the app or other channels, like social media companies, based on how you use our products and services and other information we hold about you.
We may also exclude ads on this basis.
We do this so we can make sure our marketing is useful.
That includes instructing platforms to show or not show Monzo adverts to existing customers.
We don‚Äôt share any other identifying information about you with social media companies than your mobile advertising ID (unless you‚Äôve disabled it)</li>
<li>track, analyse and improve the services we give you and other customers and how you respond to ads we show.

<li>share insights with the public about spending, saving or borrowing trends based on data that doesn‚Äôt personally identify you</li>
<li>don‚Äôt sell any of this information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Special features</strong>
</p>
<p>We:</p>

<li>give you reports on how you‚Äôve spent and/or saved money using Monzo (‚ÄòSpending Reports‚Äô and ‚ÄòYear in Monzo‚Äô)</li>
<li>personalise your visual experience in the Monzo app, like choosing a picture for your virtual loan card based on what you‚Äôve told us you‚Äôll use the loan for.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Security and business management</strong>

<li>manage Monzo‚Äôs business risk and financial affairs, and protect our customers and staff</li>

This helps us make responsible lending decisions and fight financial crime</li>
<li>share your name, title and account number with other banks and building societies, so that people making payments to you can confirm the name they have for you matches the name we hold in our records.
This helps us fight financial crime.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Companies that give services to us</strong>
</p>
<p>We:</p>
<ul>
<li>share your information with companies that so they can help us provide our services (see ‚ÄòWho we share your data with‚Äô below).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Consent</strong>.
We‚Äôll ask for your consent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>record any issues you want us to know about so we understand how to best support you.
(If the information is sensitive, we need a second lawful basis, see ‚ÄòOur reasons for using special category information‚Äô below.)</li>
<li>tell you about our products and services, and those of our partners by email or push notification if we think they‚Äôre of interest to you.
You can unsubscribe from these by email or via the app.
(If you don‚Äôt want to see lending promotions in the app, you can opt out in your app ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô.)</li>
<li>help protect you against fraud by tracking the location of your phone if you‚Äôve authorised it (iOS)</li>
<li>show your profile picture in the app if you add one</li>
<li>show your profile picture and name to Monzo contacts in their app if you turn on ‚ÄòPayments with Friends‚Äô, provided they‚Äôve stored your phone number.
(If you pay someone, they‚Äôll see your name regardless of whether or not you‚Äôve turned on Payments with Friends.
It‚Äôs our legal duty to show this, so it isn‚Äôt something you can opt out of.)</li>
<li>share information about you with companies we work with when we need your permission (see ‚ÄòWho we share your data with‚Äô below).</li>
</ul>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to share information about yourself if you don‚Äôt want to.
But if you don‚Äôt, you may not be able to use some (or any) of our services.</p>
Our reasons for using special category information
<p>We may need to process sensitive information about customers that data protection laws call ‚Äòspecial category‚Äô data.
This is information that can reveal a person‚Äôs racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership, as well as genetic or biometric data (if used for identification purposes) and information concerning a person‚Äôs health, sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Data protection laws say we need a second lawful basis to use special category data.
This can be: explicit consent, exercising legal rights in the field of employment, protecting vital interests, establishing, defending or exercising legal claims or reasons of substantial public interest.
In this section we explain which lawful basis we rely on to use your special category data in a certain way.</p>
<p>
<strong>It‚Äôs necessary for reasons of substantial public interest</strong>
</p>
<p>We:</p>
<ul>
<li>use facial recognition technology to identify people who use our services in the Monzo app.
We do this because it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest to prevent or detect unlawful acts</li>
<li>record information about your health if it‚Äôs necessary to protect your economic well-being if you‚Äôre at risk, and seeking consent would be unreasonable or negatively impact our ability to help you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>It's necessary to protect your or another person‚Äôs vital interests.</strong> We may share information about you externally (generally with law enforcement in an emergency), if it‚Äôs necessary to protect your or another person‚Äôs life and you are unable to consent.</p>
<p>
<strong>We have your explicit consent.</strong> We record any issues you want us to know about relating to your health, so we understand how to best support you.</p>
Who we share your data with ü§ù
<p>
<strong>Companies that give services to us.</strong> Here we mean companies that help us provide services you use, and need to process details about you for this reason.

<strong>Credit reference agencies</strong>.
Credit reference agencies (CRAs) give lenders information about borrowers to help them make responsible lending decisions.
Banks share details about their customers to help CRAs maintain up-to-date information about people‚Äôs financial status.
We work with TransUnion, Experian and Equifax.</p>

This includes:</p>
<ul>

<li>accounts you have, including when you opened them and money going into them (if you owe us money, we‚Äôll also share your balance)</li>
<li>credit applications you‚Äôve made and limits you‚Äôve turned on</li>
<li>if you‚Äôve borrowed, details of your loan and repayments (like whether you repay in full and on time)</li>
<li>fraud prevention information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôll use this information to to comply with our legal duties and when it‚Äôs in our ‚Äòlegitimate interest‚Äô to:</p>
<ul>
<li>verify your identity and make sure what you‚Äôve told us is true</li>
<li>help detect and prevent fraud and money laundering</li>
<li>assess whether you can afford to make repayments if you borrow</li>
<li>manage your account with us</li>
<li>trace and recover debts</li>
<li>make sure our offers are relevant for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about how the CRAs we work with use your data, read TransUnion, Equifax and Experian‚Äôs Credit Reference Agency Information Notices.</p>
<p>
<strong>Fraud prevention agencies</strong>.
When you apply for an account, we check your record with fraud prevention agencies (FPAs) like Cifas.
During the application process and after you become a customer, we may share information about you with them to help prevent fraud and money laundering when it‚Äôs in our ‚Äòlegitimate interest‚Äô.
If we detect fraud, we may stop activity on your account or block access.
Other organisations may use information we share with FPAs about fraud to refuse their services, finance or employment.
For more information about the details we collect from and share with Cifas and how they‚Äôll use your data, see Cifas‚Äô Fair Processing Notice.</p>
<p>
<strong>Anyone you give us permission to share it with.</strong> We tell you in the app when we need your consent to share your data with:</p>
<ul>
<li>companies that introduce their own services via the Monzo app, like energy switching, insurance or remortgaging</li>
<li>other customers you want to set up joint Monzo accounts with</li>
<li>other apps</li>
<li>other banks if you use account switching or aggregation services</li>
<li>people you‚Äôve asked to represent you, like solicitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<li>other banks to help trace money if you‚Äôre a victim of fraud or other crimes or if there‚Äôs a dispute about a payment</li>
<li>any other third parties where necessary to meet our legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also share your details with people or companies if there‚Äôs a corporate restructure, merger, acquisition or takeover.</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Monzo Group companies.</strong> Our subsidiaries in the US help us with customer support.
We may also share details about you with Monzo Inc for other lawful reasons if you open a US Monzo account (this is only available to US residents).</p>
Monzo Plus and Monzo Premium
<p>If you sign up for Monzo Premium, we‚Äôll share your name and contact details with our insurance and airport lounge partners so they can provide the services you get through Monzo Premium.
We also share your account details, so insurance partners can pay you if you make a successful insurance claim, and we share your payment details so we can collect payments you owe us for using lounge access benefits.
Our legal basis for sharing your information for these reasons is ‚Äòcontractual necessity‚Äô: we need to use your data for a contract we have with you.
To learn how our partners will use your information, please read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assurant‚Äôs Privacy Notice (phone insurance)</li>
<li>Axa‚Äôs Privacy Notice (travel insurance)</li>
<li>LoungeKey‚Äôs Privacy Notice (airport lounge access)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you sign up for Monzo Plus or Monzo Premium and start using Credit Tracker, please read the Credit Tracker Privacy Notice.
If you start using the ‚ÄòOther Accounts in Monzo‚Äô service, please read the Other Accounts in Monzo Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>If you use the auto export feature to transfer transaction data into your Google Drive account, we‚Äôll share this information with the Google company that manages your account until you pause exports or remove access.
We‚Äôll have access to your spreadsheet, but won‚Äôt collect the information in it.</p>
When we make automated decisions üì≤
<p>We sometimes use computers to make decisions.
We do this for deciding if:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can give you a Monzo account based on your age, residency, nationality, financial position and other circumstances, like the results of anti-money laundering and sanctions checks</li>
<li>we can give you an arranged overdraft or loan based on information we hold about you, and information we get from credit reference agencies.
This includes details on whether you‚Äôve kept up to date with payments on any credit accounts, and if you‚Äôve been to court</li>
<li>we need to take action, like freeze a transaction or account, because we suspect fraud or money-laundering against Monzo or a customer.
Our computers decide this based on patterns in our data, like an account or policy being used in a way that fraudsters work</li>
<li>our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ask for a member of the team to review a decision via Monzo Chat.
If your application for a Monzo account was rejected, you can ask us to check this decision by emailing review@monzo.com.</p>
How long we keep your information üìÅ
<p>We keep most of your data as long as you‚Äôre using Monzo, and for 6 years after that to comply with the law and if we face a legal challenge.
In some circumstances, like cases of anti-money laundering or fraud, we may keep data longer if we need to (that‚Äôs in our legitimate interest) and/or the law says we have to.</p>
<p>To work out how long we keep different categories of data, we consider why we hold it, how sensitive it is, how long the law says we need to keep it for, and what the risks are.</p>
Your rights ‚úÖ
<p>You have a right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>access the personal data we hold about you, or to get a copy of it</li>
<li>ask for a copy of your personal data in a portable (machine-readable) format or make us send it to someone else</li>
<li>make us correct inaccurate data</li>
<li>ask us to delete, 'block' or suppress your data, though for legal reasons we might not always be able to do it</li>
<li>say no to us using your data for direct marketing and in certain other ‚Äòlegitimate interest‚Äô circumstances</li>
<li>withdraw any consent you‚Äôve given us</li>
<li>ask a member of staff to review a computer-made (automated) decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do any of these things, please contact us through the app or by emailing help@monzo.com.
If your application for a Monzo account was rejected and you want us to review that decision, please email review@monzo.com.
EU data protection laws give us one month to respond.</p>
Where we store or send your data üîí
<p>We may transfer and store the data we collect from you to organisations outside the UK and the European Economic Area (‚ÄòEEA‚Äô).
When we do this, we make sure that your data is protected and that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the European Commission says the country or organisation has adequate data protection, or</li>
<li>we‚Äôve agreed standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission with the organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôd like a copy of the relevant data protection clauses, please get in touch via Monzo chat or send an email to help@monzo.com.</p>
How to make a complaint üòî
<p>If you have a complaint about how we use your personal information, please contact us through the app or send an email to help@monzo.com and we‚Äôll do our best to fix the problem.
You can also reach our Data Protection Officer in these ways.</p>
