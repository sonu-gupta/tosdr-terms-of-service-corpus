<u>What are cookies?</u>
</b>
</p>
<p>Like most websites you visit, our Site uses cookies and other similar technologies described below (generally referred to as “<b>
<i>cookies</i>
</b>” in this policy) for the purposes described in the section headed “How we use cookies”.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Cookies are text files embedded in a web page that contain small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a Site or embedded in a web page.
Cookies may then be sent back to the originating Site on each subsequent visit, or to another Site that recognises that cookie.
Cookies are useful because they allow a Site to recognise a user’s device and to remember your actions and preferences (such as login details, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time.
</p>
<p>Where possible, security measures are put in place to prevent unauthorised access to our cookies and similar technologies.
A unique identifier ensures that only we and/or our authorised service providers have access to cookie data.</p>
<p>
<b>Web beacons</b>
</p>
<p>Web beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs) are typically transparent graphic images placed on a site or email.
Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to learn about our visitors` interactions, capture visitor’s journey on our Site, to create segment categories and behaviour patterns, or to serve targeted advertisements.
We (or the third parties we use) use beacons to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page.</p>
<p>
<b>IP addresses and URLs</b>
</p>
<p>An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices used to identify and communicate with each other on the internet.
When you visit our Site, we (or the third parties we use) may view the IP address of the device that you use to connect to the internet using a web beacon.
</p>
<p>We (or the third parties we use) use only the redacted part of the IP address to determine the broader physical location of the device so that we can`t identify your precise location.
This helps us to understand from what geographic regions (e.g.
city, province, country, like Slough, United Kingdom) our Site visitors come in order to change the way we present our Site to you, to enhance your visit or to customize our marketing content.
If we want to collect&nbsp;your precise location data for our advertising purposes, we obtain your consent to this.
</p>
<p>A URL (uniform resource locator) is a unique identifier or address for each resource on the internet, in effect it is the address for the web page that you are visiting.
We use this information to see which sites and pages are visited and the way that you navigate through our Site.</p>
<p>
<b>Device IDs </b>
</p>
<p>Device IDs are distinctive numbers associated with a smartphone or similar handheld device from which the internet can be accessed.&nbsp;We use device IDs for the same purposes for which we use cookies, as described in this policy.</p>
<p>
<b>Device fingerprinting</b>
</p>
<p>Device fingerprinting is a way to combine certain attributes of a device e.g.
its operating system, the type and version of browser being used, language settings and IP addresses etc which are used together to identify unique devices.&nbsp;To the extent that fingerprinting is used, we use it for the same purposes for which we use cookies.

</p>
<p>We also use the cookies in this category to place you into a group of consumers who show the same interests (e.g.
age, gender, interest category) (also known as an “audience”).
Generally, this process does not require us to know you as an identifiable individual, only that someone using your browser showed interest in a product.
We may add other information to this, such as information about the products you buy in an online shop, or information that you provide directly to us when creating an account on our Sites, or information about your browsing history.</p>
<p>By using advertising cookies, we can: </p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learn about trends, habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly.

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show you personalized advertisements on our Site or other sites you visit.
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find others who appear to be similar in interests, characteristics or behaviours to those already in the interest group, so we can reach more potential customers by showing relevant advertising to them.
</p>
<p>We partner with third-party service providers (e.g.
Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.) which may use cookies, web beacons and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from our Site.&nbsp;These third parties use this information to help us with the advertising described above including to target ads and to provide us with measurement services and reports of the success of our advertising campaigns that are run through our Sites or other sites across the internet.
</p>
<p>If you turn off these cookies you will see less targeted, interest-based advertising.
however, it does not mean you will not see any advertisements.
Even if you opt-out receiving interest-based advertisements, you will still be shown advertisements about our products or brands based on the context of the sites you visit (these are called “<i>contextual ads</i>”).
</p>
