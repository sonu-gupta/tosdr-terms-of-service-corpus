<p>We believe that we can enhance your experience on our Properties through the information you share with us.
However, you may choose to enjoy some of the content and features on our Properties without directly providing us with any information about you.
but, as described below, some information is automatically collected when you visit our Properties.
In addition, in order for you to take advantage of certain features and services offered on our Properties, you may be required to provide us with Personal Information.</p>
<p>The Properties provide certain activities in which we gather Personal Information from users of the Properties, such as an activity that requires that a user complete a registration process and receive/select a “user name” and password.
Registration to participate in these Property activities may require the submission of your email address, zip code, date of birth and other Personal Information.
Personal Information that may be submitted include your password hints, gender, personal interests, industry you work in, occupation/role, household income, communication preferences, preferred news source, and any other information you provide to us in order to use a Property feature or service.
If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.
You may also provide us with photographs or video materials that contain Personal Information about you.
In addition, you may have the ability to opt in to additional subscription services, such as email news alerts or promotional and marketing information to be received directly from our advertisers (those who pay us to place advertisements on our Properties) which may require you to provide certain Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may collect Personal Information from the testimonials or posts you may provide.
If you submit any testimonials to be posted on our Properties, we will obtain your consent prior to using your name and testimonial.</p>
<p>We may also collect Personal Information about you when such information is provided by another individual on your behalf (for example, if another individual submits a birthday notice with your name and email address).
For certain activities you may be asked to submit a person’s name, address, phone number and/or email address.</p>
<em>Information Collected Automatically.&nbsp;</em>
<p>In addition to the information that you may provide to us, our Properties also automatically collect Other Information about you that may include information related to your computer, including your browser type, operating system and computer monitor resolution.

sites and/or applications you visited before and after visiting our Properties.
web pages and advertisements you view.
links you click on our Properties.
unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law (provided that if we choose to implement such functionality, we will obtain your consent on your first use of the service).
information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies.
information about your interactions with video content, such as the type of content viewed.
information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded.

<em>Information Obtained from Other Sources.&nbsp;</em>
<p>Where permitted by applicable law, we may also obtain Other Information (e.g.

<em>Combining Information.&nbsp;</em>
<p>Please note that all of the information we collect about you may be combined, to help us tailor our communications to you and to develop rich online content and services across the Properties.</p>
<em>Wireless Device Information.&nbsp;</em>
<p>Unless otherwise provided in a separate registration page, we do not request for marketing purposes, contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “wireless.bellsouth.com”) as part of the contact information.
Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial marketing email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent.
We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest/sweepstakes or membership club.
However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial marketing email.
We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name, as such messages are not deemed to be commercial marketing email.</p> 4.

These technical methods may enable us to collect and use your Personal Information.</p> 5.
