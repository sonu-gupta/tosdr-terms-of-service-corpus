<p>This site and its owner <strong>do NOT</strong> store your personal information <strong>in any way</strong>.
However, the site does use certain <strong>externally hosted</strong> services, each of which has its own privacy policies and methods of complying with applicable privacy regulations.</p>Notes about external servicesFathom Analytics<p>This site uses Fathom Analytics, which does not store your personal data in any way.
Please refer also to my article, “Fathom Analytics: count on it.”</p>Google Fonts<p>When I learned that the use of Google Fonts <em>served from</em> Google will transmit a visitor’s apparently <strong>not</strong> anonymized IP address<sup>1</sup> to Google, I quit using this product (and suggesting to others that they use it) and, instead, served from my own site any typefaces that aren’t part of the so-called “system fonts stack.”</p>Twitter<p>This site uses eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet to embed tweets as purely static content with <strong>no</strong>&nbsp;cookies, and the site’s Content Security Policy blocks any images (typically, one per embedded tweet) that Twitter otherwise could use to track you.</p>Other considerationsEmbedded videos<p>I no longer embed YouTube or other sites’ videos, since they can and do transmit personal information through cookies.
In the two instances where I formerly did—“Some curmudgeonish thoughts” and “Coherence and COVID-19”—I replaced them with clearly identified links to their original locations, and footnoted each link with a reference and link to this privacy policy.</p>
