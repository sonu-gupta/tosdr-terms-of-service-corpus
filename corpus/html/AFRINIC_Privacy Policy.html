<p>&nbsp;</p>
2.
Which personal data do we collect?
<p>To fulfil our role as a Regional Internet Registry, AFRINIC collects information through the use of its websites, the MyAFRINIC member portal, the New Member Registration Portal systems, WHOIS services, mailing lists and interactions with individuals.</p>

The provision of this information is purely voluntary, and you may opt-out of receiving our campaign communications at any time by unsubscribing to these communications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>voice (if you speak);</li>
<li>name, as entered (if joining via a video link) or extract of the telephone number (if joining via telephone and not withholding your number).</li>

To whom do we disclose personal data?
<p>Your data may be shared as follows:</p>

<li>between and among members of AFRINIC as may be relevant for the purposes set out in section 1 above, but we shall only do so on a strictly need to know basis;</li>
<li>with our employees for purposes of fulfilling our organisational activities, treating job applications or conducting internal analysis to improve our company and services.
and</li>
<li>with our agents, advisers, accountants, auditors, lawyers, other professional advisors, contractors or third-party service providers (e.g.
software providers for virtual meetings)to assist us in managing better, support or develop our business and comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>AFRINIC ensures that your data is always safe.
Only designated staff will access your information to fulfil our agreement, treatment of job applications, or promoting our professional relationship with you.
Also, third parties with whom we share your data will be contractually obliged to safeguard all personal data to which they have access.</p>
<p>Please note that some disclosures will not require your consent, this happens when we share your data with;</p>
<ol>
<li>law enforcement bodies/agencies and other statutory authorities if required by law and</li>
<li>if required or authorised by law or if we suspect any unlawful activities on your part.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we have collected your data for a third-party, that data will be under their privacy policy, for which AFRINIC will not be responsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
4.
Overseas transfers of your information
<p>In some cases, we may need to transfer your data with organisations located in countries outside our territorial limits to provide our services to you.
We will secure the data transfer.</p>
<p>Our current virtual meetings provider Zoom hosts services from the USA.
Limited amounts of personal information, such as your IP address, may be transferred.
Still, it is given the same level of technical and legal protection as within Mauritius and the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Communications
<p>Occasionally, we could use your name and contact information to send you emails, post, or social media information that we think may be of interest to you, including stories, events, products and services offered by AFRINIC.
However, we can only do so with your consent.</p>
<p>You will also be able to opt-out from receiving such communications at any time, free of charge, by contacting us following the section “Contact Us” below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
6.
How long do we keep your information?
<p>Your data will be stored for as long as required to fulfil our organisational purposes and for the period required by law.
As per legal requirements, we will take reasonable steps to secure and anonymise your data and destroy it when retention is no longer necessary for legal or organisational goals (as set out in section 1 of this statement).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
7.
Processing of personal data must be justified
<p>We will only process your data where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do so, such as</p>
<ol>
<li>for the performance of a contract between us;</li>
<li>where you have provided us with your express consent to process your data for a specific purpose;</li>
<li>our use of your information is necessary to fulfil our statutory obligations with relevant authorities (regulators, tax officials, law enforcement bodies) or otherwise meet our legal responsibilities;</li>
<li>our use of your data is in our legitimate interest as a Regional Internet Registry;</li>
<li>for historical, statistical or scientific research.</li>
<li>Security of personal information</li>
</ol>
<p>AFRINIC has in place reasonable technical and organisational measures to prevent unauthorised or accidental access, processing, erasure, loss or use of your data and to keep your data confidential.
These measures are subject to ongoing review and monitoring.</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee that our website will function without disruptions.

<ul>
<li>the uses of electronic means of communication, including, but not limited to, damages resulting from the failure or delay in delivery of electronic communications,</li>
<li>interception or manipulation of electronic communications by third parties or by computer programs used for electronic communications and transmission of viruses.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
9.
Links to other websites
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites, apps, content, services or resources on the internet.
If you access those websites, apps, content, services or resources using the links provided, please be aware that they may have their privacy policy.</p>
<p>We do not accept any responsibilities or liabilities for their policies or for any data which they may collect through their sites.
Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to these other websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
10.
Access to your data
<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
To do this, contact our Data Protection Officer and specify what information you would like.
We will take all reasonable steps to confirm your identity before providing details of your data.</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
11.
Correction of your data
<p>You have the right to ask us to update, correct or delete your data.
We will take all reasonable steps to confirm your identity before making changes to personal data we may hold about you.</p>
<p>We would appreciate it if you would take steps to notify us of any changes with your data accuracy that we need to know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
12.
Withdrawal of consent and request for deletion of personal data
<p>You may also withdraw your consent to receiving information from us, or more generally to our processing of your data, at any time, and you may in certain circumstances ask us to delete your data.
However, we may not be able to fulfil our contractual obligations towards you if you entirely withdraw your consent or ask us to delete your data entirely.
To protect your data, we shall require you to first prove your identity at the time of the request, for instance, by providing a copy of your national identification card, contact details or answering some other security questions to satisfy our authentication process, before we may proceed with your request(s).</p>
<p>Whenever reasonably possible and required, we will strive to grant these rights within 30 days.
However, our response time will depend on the complexity of your requests.
We will respond to your requests free of charge, unless if, your request involves processing or retrieving a significant volume of data, or if we consider that your application is unfounded, excessive or repetitive in which case we reserve the right to charge a fee (as mentioned above regarding access).</p>
<p>There may be circumstances where we are not able to comply with your requests, typically concerning a request to erase your data or where you object to the processing of your information for a specific purpose or where you request that we restrict the use of your data where we need to keep your data to comply with a legal obligation or where we need to use such information to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
To make these requests, or if you have any questions or complaints about how we handle your data or would like us to update the information we maintain about you and your preferences, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address set out under section 16 below.</p>
