<strong>Updated April 20, 2021</strong>
<p>ShareThis takes privacy seriously.
&nbsp;This Privacy Notice sets out what data we collect, how we collect it, why we process it, who we may share it with and, where the data we collect is personal data, your rights with respect to such personal data.
ShareThis may change this Notice from time to time by updating this page.
You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are up to date with any changes.&nbsp.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ShareThis is committed to processing information in accordance with applicable laws (including where applicable the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and as described in this Privacy Notice.
For specific information about how ShareThis adheres to the GDPR and your rights as an EEA data subject please click <strong>here.
</strong>For information about how ShareThis adheres to the CCPA, please click <strong>here.</strong>
</p>
<p>To access information for Publishers, please visit the Publisher Information page <strong>here</strong>
<strong>.</strong>
<br>To access Publisher Terms of Use please click here.</p>Opt-Out of Data Collection and Sharing About ShareThis and its Tools<p>ShareThis provides website operators (“Publishers”) with customizable social sharing tools, which makes sharing online content simple.
Any user of a website can easily share anything on the web with their friends on social sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Email, Digg, Reddit and more through using one of our tools on that website (“<strong>ShareThis Icon</strong>”).</p>
<p>ShareThis also collects data about internet users and how they interact with content, websites and adverts which enables ShareThis and our Publishers, advertisers, customers and data partners to facilitate the delivery of relevant, targeted advertising online to these groups.
We also carry out analytics and provide insights to understand internet users’ behaviour and improve the effectiveness of online content and advertising, based on such browsing, sharing, and what is considered to be the profile of that group.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do this by using technology such as cookies and pixels (including pixels and cookies for our customers) (“<strong>ShareThis Publisher Applications</strong>”) to gather information regarding the browsing and sharing activities of internet users, both on websites that use our ShareThis Icon and other websites which have our technology installed on them.
We also receive data from others who operate in the data analytics and advertising industries.
We analyse and aggregate the data we collect to create groups of data (called audience segments) based on defined criteria.&nbsp.
For example, we segment into groups internet users who we believe have similar characteristics, interests, needs or behavioral patterns.
Where we are able to infer that two or more browsers or devices are the same user or household, we may use that information to bolster our audience segments.</p>
<p>Targeted advertising has the aim of displaying advertising which is more likely to be of interest to internet users, based on analyses of their recent browsing and sharing activities and interactions with the website and adverts.
It is also sometimes referred to as interest-based advertising or online behavioural advertising.
For more information on this type of advertising, click here.</p>Data Collection and Use<p>In order to offer our products and services, we collect and use data relating to the websites you visit to display personalized advertisements, provide analytics, and data modeling based on social sharing, by us or third parties.
This data is pseudonymous in that it may not be used directly by ShareThis to identify an actual person.
This data does enable our systems to recognize your computer, device and/or browser over time.</p>
<p>In many places, this data is considered personal data as it relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
<p>We do not intentionally collect contact information such as your name, address, phone number, address, credit card information, or anything else that can allow us or our customers to contact you directly as part of our products and services.
We may collect such information if you are one of our Publishers or if you have a business relationship with ShareThis.<br>
</p> Additional Information<p>We have set out below the categories of data we process and why we process each category of data.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.Usage Data and Profile Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.1 Usage Data</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect information about how <em>internet users</em> browse the internet and interact with online content and advertisements through our ShareThis Icon, the ShareThis Publisher Applications and user interactions with advertisements on the internet.
We call this “Usage Data”.</p>
<p>Usage Data includes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the unique IDs of the cookie(s) placed on your web browser (example: 37d387ca-f68a-11e5-b87d-0e58954c72b1) and/or a hashed version of an email address which help us recognize your browser or device over time.</li>
<li>Information about the user’s browser and device</li>
<li>User agent string</li>
<li>Webpages viewed (including the URL addresses of such pages and search parameters, which may include search terms and key words) and the previous web pages that referred the user to that webpage&nbsp;</li>
<li>Time when webpages are viewed</li>
<li>Search queries from which users are directed to a webpage</li>
<li>Navigation from page to page</li>
<li>Time spent on each webpage</li>
<li>Interactions with the webpage, including items clicked or selected and content highlighted or copied</li>
<li>Ads viewed or displayed to the user and the user’s interactions with those ads</li>
<li>Shares of content including what content is shared and where – for example, the relevant social media site (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)</li>
<li>Geographic information such as country, city, state or postal code.</li>
<li>IP addresses</li>
<li>Device IDs</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the Usage Data listed above is not used by ShareThis to directly identify an actual person, it is considered to be personal data in many places.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.2 Profile Information </strong>
</p>
<p>We receive information about the content of the websites that you visit and information about the audience of those websites to enable us to infer and create groups of users who have similar characteristics, interests or behavioral patterns.
We combine the Usage Data with data we receive from third party advertisers, analytics vendors and data partners to create categories of data that are helpful to advertisers seeking to deliver a more personalized advertising experience.
For example, if a user regularly views or shares content about shopping for a car, our systems may infer that this user may be interested in purchasing an automobile.&nbsp.
This practice is sometimes referred to as interest based advertising, and a segment titled “interested in automobile” is sometimes referred to as an audience segment or a “profile.” When we group this data into profiles, we refer to it as<strong> “Profile Information”.</strong>
</p>
<p>We can infer this Profile Information (by reference to browser identifiers, not actual names) using the information we obtain from third parties about the likely content and characteristics of the users and audiences of the websites which are visited.
For example, users of a particular website may have an interest in cars and typically be within a certain age or income range.
Where we are able to infer that two or more browsers or devices are the same user or household, we may use that information to bolster our Profile Information.</p>
<p>The characteristics by which we group users relate to age ranges, income ranges, education, gender, ethnicity and family composition, on the basis of the typical audience of websites they visit and content viewed.</p>
<p>In certain cases where Publishers that we work with utilize the “Google Analytics By ShareThis WordPress” plug-in on their websites, ShareThis uses a Google Analytics feature currently known as Google Analytics Demographics, in order to better understand the audience demographics of those Publisher websites, and to provide insights about those demographics to the Publishers that own or operate those websites.
Where Google Analytics Demographics is enabled, certain Usage Data and Profile Information will be shared with Google so that we may provide demographic reporting features to those Publishers.
To learn more about Google Analytics’ privacy practices, please click here.
To opt-out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, please click here, or you may also visit the NAI consumer choice page.</p>
<p>If you would like to see a list of the types of Profile Information used by ShareThis, including any Profile Information that is health or political in nature (U.S.
only), please click here.
ShareThis does not create Profile Information based upon visits to adult entertainment websites.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.3 How we obtain Usage Data and Profile Information </strong>
</p>
<p>We collect Usage Data when your device visits our website, uses or interacts with our services (including sharing content with the ShareThis Icon), when your device visits Publishers’ websites that use ShareThis Publisher Applications, and when your device views or clicks advertisements that we serve or are served on our behalf.&nbsp.
We do so by using cookies placed on your browser, pixel tags, and HTTP headers (or other communication protocols) and the use of hashed email address..</p>
<p>
<em>Our use of Cookies and other Tracking Technologies</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Web Environment:</strong> (desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)</p>
<p>ShareThis uses browser cookies to “tag” visitors on the websites that use ShareThis Publisher Applications.
These users are given a technical identifier, such as C62414AY9324FB5671069928026P0067.</p>
<p>This browser cookie tracks the user’s browsing data.
Pixel tags are then used to transfer this browsing data to ShareThis and our customers and data partners.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies:&nbsp;</strong>Small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a browser.
Cookies are installed on a browser by the publisher of a website as well by third parties who do not operate the website but whose JavaScript and/or pixel tags (described below) are found on the website.
ShareThis cookies and cookies of our customers are installed in user browsers by the ShareThis Publisher Applications which are on Publishers’ websites.
Many browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
However, you may be able to change your browser settings to refuse or otherwise restrict cookies.
Check your browser’s “Help” files to learn more about handling cookies on your browser.<strong>

<strong>Pixel tags: </strong>These&nbsp;are small blocks of code on a webpage which read and place cookies.
When you visit a webpage, ShareThis’ pixel will see if your browser has a ShareThis cookie installed on it.
If it doesn’t, the pixel will install the cookie.
If it does, the pixel will “read” the cookie and will send us information such as the time you viewed a webpage, the type of browser used and your IP address.
This is how we learn about your interests and enable our customers to deliver targeted advertising to you.</p>
<p>
<strong>HTTP headers:&nbsp;</strong>These are transmitted whenever a webpage is viewed, and contain technical information required to connect your browser to the webpage.
This information may include information about the browser and the requested webpage.
ShareThis collects this information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Hashed emails:&nbsp;</strong>Hashing an email is a cryptographic function.
Hashing is a way of encrypting a piece of data, like an email address, into a hexadecimal string.
By doing this, each email address becomes an unrecognizable jumble of numbers and letters.
This technique doesn’t allow us to send you an email message or to identify who you are.
However, it does allow us to recognize your browser or device in the same way that cookies help us to recognize your browser or device.
ShareThis may obtain hashed emails from our advertising partners to help provide our products and services.
We may also receive and hash emails you provide to our Publishers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Environments: </strong>(Mobile applications)</p>
<p>To serve ads in mobile applications identifiers may be used, such as Google Advertising ID or Apple IDFA, depending on the operating system of your mobile device.
The advertiser identifier identifies your device but not you directly and can be reset by you.
See your device manufacturer for more information or visit NAI Mobile opt-out page at https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice/.</p>
<p>
<strong>Linking Environments</strong>: (browsers and mobile apps used)</p>
<p>To serve you personalized advertisements and provide a seamless online experience, third party data partners that we work with may link your identifiers on the different environments you use.
We may enable the linking of our Usage Data through cookie syncing.
We do not use plain text information that may be used by ShareThis to identify you such as your name or address to operate the linking.
Our data partners may use exact linking methods by leveraging the pseudonymous data collected through our technology such as advertising partner identifiers.</p>
<p>You can manage cookies, change consents or opt out of personalized ads using the mechanisms described in ‘User Choices’.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.4 How we use Usage Data and Profile Information</strong>
</p>
<p>We use Usage Data and Profile Information to enable the delivery of targeted advertising, to provide analytics, and for data modeling&nbsp;using cookies or similar tracking technologies described above.&nbsp;In addition, we may license portions of this data to our partners for their use for targeted advertising, analytics and modeling.
Where allowed by law, our customers may use this data for other uses such as addressing fraud, enhancing their security efforts or understanding macro investment trends.</p>
<p>Our customers who we share your data with may use this information to generate their own Profile Information.
They may independently gain other demographical information about you through their own cookies or web beacons and combine it with the data we provide to them.
The use of cookies and pixel tags by these third-party advertisers, publishers, and ad networks are subject to their own privacy policies.

</p> The GDPR and Your Rights as an EU or UK Data Subject<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to our processing of personal data.
If you are located in the United Kingdom, then the Data Protection Act 2018 applies to our processing of personal data.
These laws each grant those located respectively in the EEA and the UK a set of clear privacy rights and imposes responsibilities on ShareThis as we process the personal data of data subjects located in those places.
The ShareThis privacy policy outlines how and why ShareThis processes personal data.
This section is designed to provide more information on how ShareThis adheres to the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 and your rights as a data subject located in the UK or the EEA.</p> Additional Information<p>
<strong>Definition of Personal Data</strong>
</p>
<p>Both the GDPR and UK Data Protection Act define personal data broadly.
As such, where Usage Data and/or Profile Information relates to an individual in the EEA or UK we treat it as personal data.
Similarly, nearly all of the data collected from EEA and UK data subjects in the context of our normal business operations is likely to be considered personal data.
This includes: a) data collected via visits to ShareThis.com.
b) data collected from Customers, Publishers and business partners.
and c) data collected from employees and prospective employees.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Special Categories of Personal Data</strong>
</p>
<p>ShareThis does not collect nor process any special categories of personal data with respect to UK or EEA data subjects, and we do not create Profile Information of audience segments of such consumers based on special categories of personal data (i.e.
data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation).<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal Basis for Processing</strong>
</p>
<p>Both the UK Data Protection Act and GDPR requires entities seeking to process personal data to have a valid legal basis for doing so.
The legal basis utilized by ShareThis include: a) consent.
b) legitimate interest (i.e., where we believe that our need to process the data and/or the value we deliver by processing such data is not outweighed by the rights of the data subject).
c) where necessary for the performance of a contract.
and d) where processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
We will endeavor to outline our legal basis for the most common types of processing conducted by ShareThis.</p>
<p>
<em>Cookie and Similar Tracking Technologies </em>– We endeavor to obtain consent for our placement of cookies, pixels and similar tracking technologies as required under the ePrivacy Directive as implemented throughout the EEA.
As ShareThis does not have direct relationships with Internet users in many cases, we ask Publishers and other partners to obtain a consent on our behalf as described below.&nbsp.
Where we directly place cookies (e.g., via ShareThis.com) we directly obtain the consent from data subjects we’ve identified as being from the EEA or other place where consent is required.</p>
<p>
<em>Usage Data and Profile Information</em> – While we obtain a consent for our placement of cookies as described above, ShareThis processes Usage Data and Profile Information under our legitimate interest.
For purposes of clarity, where this data is utilized for analytics, targeted advertising, measurement or reporting, we also process it via legitimate interest.
To offer additional transparency, we endeavor to mention some of these use cases in the consents obtained for cookies and pixels.</p>
<p>
<em>Website Data</em>
<strong>
</strong>– We collect personal data via ShareThis.com.
Where that data is provided to ShareThis (e.g., via completing an online form), we consider it either Account Data and/or data collected pursuant to a Business Relationship which are described below.
Where we place cookies via the website, we use consent.
Where data is collected automatically (e.g., log files containing IP addresses), we process such data via our legitimate interest and in order to maintain the website and help us to a better job of personalizing the website to the interests of visitors.</p>
<p>
<em>Account Data and Business Relationships</em> – We require some Publishers to setup an Account with ShareThis.
Similarly, we maintain accounts containing personal data with most of the vendors who provide services to ShareThis, our Customers, our employees and our business partners.
If you are an employee of one of those entities, ShareThis may have your personal data including your name, your work email or your work telephone number.
For data subjects located in the EEA or UK, we process this data under the legal basis of contractual necessity.
In other words, we need to process this data in order to honor the terms of the contract between ShareThis and the Publisher, Customer, vendor, Etc.
This includes maintaining an account and login credentials, billing and payment purposes, communicating with the other party, and fulfilling requests.
Where we are seeking to market additional products and services to these entities, we will do so via legitimate interest unless applicable law dictates that we use consent (e.g., for email marketing).</p>
<p>
<em>General Purposes</em> – There are a number of instances where ShareThis processes personal data which are distinct from the descriptions provided above.
For example:</p>
<p>Legal and Regulatory Compliance – Like most companies, ShareThis will process data in order to comply with law, cooperate with requests from competent legal authorities such as the police, and to pay taxes.
The legal basis for this type of processing is necessary for ShareThis to meet our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>Enforcement of legal obligations – To enforce our terms and conditions, protect of our intellectual property and/or the rights of third parties, ShareThis processes personal data in these instances via our legitimate interest.
This may include obtaining advice and conducting legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Sell and Promote our Business – ShareThis may choose to conduct, evaluate and/or promote the sale of our business via our legitimate interest.</p>
<p>
<em>Aggregated Data </em>– Where we aggregate data and remove digital identifiers (e.g., cookie IDs), we may use this data for internal research, marketing, and statistical analysis purposes.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Controller</strong>
</p>
<p>ShareThis is generally a Controller of data with respect to the data processed as described above.
Where the GDPR or UK Data Protection Act applies to Usage Data and Profile Information and we share this data with our Customers, our Customers are independent controllers in relation to their processing of such data and they process it in accordance with their own privacy policies.
ShareThis is also the controller of the data it collects via ShareThis.com.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Processors</strong>
</p>
<p>ShareThis also has a number of agents and service providers who operate as processors of data on ShareThis’ behalf.
This agents and service providers are only able to use the data as specifically directed by ShareThis and only to provide the services requested by us.
They are also contractually obligated to process the data securely and under confidentiality obligations.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>UK and EU Data Subject Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>Where the GDPR or UK Data Protection Act applies, such data subjects have certain rights, including: a) The right to be informed about the types of data being processed and the legal basis for processing.
b) the right to access and see the data being processed.
c) the right of rectification, to make corrections to data subject to processing.
d) the right to erase data.
e) the right to restrict processing of data.
f) the right of data portability.
g) the right to object to the processing of data and f) the right not to be subject to automated decision-making.
Some of these rights apply only in certain circumstances and depend on the legal basis relied upon to process the data.
As an example, the right to object applies to processing which is carried out because it is necessary for our legitimate interests and only if we cannot demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds which outweigh your rights, interests and freedoms.
The same right does not apply to processing which is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations or to perform a contract with you.
Given that both the UK Data Protection Act and the GDPR defines personal data broadly, these rights may extend to the personal data we place into cookies or similar tracking technologies.<br>
</p>
<p>Where processing is based on your consent, in accordance with the GDPR and UK Data Protection Act (as applicable), you may withdraw that consent at any time, although any processing previously carried out will still be legal.
In order to exercise your data subjects’ rights or if you have any questions about these rights, you can write to us at privacy@sharethis.com.
We will endeavor to respond to any requests to exercise your rights within one month from when they are made, although this period may be extended in some cases in which case we will inform you before the expiration of the one month period.<br>
</p>
<p>You also have the right to submit complaints to the supervisory authority in your jurisdiction.
A list of supervisory authorities in the EEA can be found here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>How ShareThis interacts with our Publishers on GDPR and UK Data Protection compliance</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are in the European Economic Area, you may be familiar with websites asking you to consent to the use of cookies and similar technologies.
If you are in the UK, you may see similar consent notices which pertain to the UK Data Protection Act.
Where the ShareThis Applications are used to process personal data from data subjects in places where a notice and/or consent is required, our Publishers are required to notify you about the use of the ShareThis Applications, mention ShareThis as a third party who processes your personal data and ask you to consent to such processing as well as the placement of cookies.<br>
</p>
<p>
<em>Cross-border transfers of EU or UK personal data</em>
</p>
<p>We generally process data in the United States.
When we share data, we provide data to companies globally.
In each case, we have safeguards in place which allow those transfers to happen in a way that ensures data is handled in accordance with the applicable law.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>When we transfer personal data outside the EEA or UK, unless the recipient or location to which the data is transferred has been approved by the appropriate authorities as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, we put in place measures to ensure that the transfer complies with the applicable data protection law and that the personal data which is transferred is appropriately safeguarded.</p>
<p>When we&nbsp;enter into business relationships which involves the&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;of EU personal&nbsp;data to the United States, we put in place&nbsp;reasonable transfer mechanisms such as the&nbsp;EU standard contractual clauses with the recipient.
More information about international data transfers under the GDPR can be found at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en.&nbsp.
If requested, we may make available a copy of such safeguards, as required by the GDPR.</p>

</p>The LGPD and Your Rights as a Brazil Data Subject<p>If you are located in Brazil, then the Brazilian General Law for the Protection of Personal Data (LGPD) applies to our processing of personal data.
The LGPD grants those located Brazil a set of clear privacy rights and imposes responsibilities on ShareThis as we process the personal data of data subjects located in Brazil.
The ShareThis privacy policy outlines how and why ShareThis processes personal data.
This section is designed to provide more information on how ShareThis adheres to the LGPD and your rights as a data subject located in Brazil.</p>
<p>
</p>Additional information<p>
<strong>Definition of Personal Data</strong>
<br>Like the GDPR, the LGPD defines personal data broadly.
As such, where Usage Data and/or Profile Information relates to an individual in the Brazil, we treat it as personal data.
Similarly, nearly all of the data collected from EEA and UK data subjects in the context of our normal business operations is likely to be considered personal data.
This includes: a) data collected via visits to ShareThis.com.
b) data collected from Customers, Publishers and business partners.
and c) data collected from employees and prospective employees, as applicable.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Special Categories of Personal Data</strong>
<br>ShareThis does not collect nor process any special categories of personal data with respect to data subjects in Brazil.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Legal Basis for Processing</strong>
<br>The LGPD entities seeking to process personal data to have a valid legal basis for doing so.
The legal basis utilized by ShareThis include: a) consent.
b) legitimate interest (i.e., where we believe that our need to process the data and/or the value we deliver by processing such data is not outweighed by the rights of the data subject).
c) where necessary for the performance of a contract.
and d) where processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Brazil and Data Subject Rights</strong>
<br>Where the LGPD applies, such data subjects have certain rights, including: a) The right to be informed about the types of data being processed and the legal basis for processing.
b) the right to access and see the data being processed.
c) the right of rectification, to make corrections to data subject to processing.
d) the right to erase data.
e) the right to restrict processing of data.
f) the right of data portability.
g) the right to object to the processing of data and f) the right not to be subject to automated decision-making.
Some of these rights apply only in certain circumstances and depend on the legal basis relied upon to process the data.
If you are located in Brazil and have questions about how ShareThis implements these rights, please email us at privacy@sharethis.com.</p>
<p>
</p>The CCPA and Your Rights as California Data Subject<p>
</p>Additional Information<p>Starting January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act
(CCPA) provides additional privacy protections for California data subjects and
users, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right to see what data we have about you, your computer or
device (i.e., the right to know),</li>
<li>the right to delete the data we have about you, your computer or
device (i.e., the right to delete), and</li>
<li>the right to opt-out of the sale of data about you, your computer
or device to certain third parties (i.e., the right to opt-out from sales of
your information).</li>
</ul>
<p>The CCPA defines personal information broadly.
And as such, almost all of the information web collect is considered personal information under the CCPA.
California data subjects may send an email to privacy@sharethis.com to exercise those rights of visit our data subject access page at CCPA GDPR Data Subject Access Request.
California data subjects may also call us on our toll free CCPA privacy hotline at 1-800-272-1765.</p>
<p>We do not treat users that exercise any of the above rights
differently.
However, we may not be able to honor a right if doing so would
violate applicable law.
ShareThis does not sell data collected via our website
or the data we use to operate our business.
However, we transfer personal
information collected via the ShareThis Publisher Applications to third parties
and as such are considered to have sold data over the past twelve months under
California law, including any of the Usage Data, Profile Information and/or
audience segments.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your California Data Subject Access and
Deletion Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides certain rights
to California consumers – including the right to know the personal information
that we may have about you, and the right to delete that information.&nbsp.
ShareThis is committed to transparency, and
we want California consumers to have access to personal information that we may
have about them and/or the devices that they may use to access the
Internet.&nbsp.
We generally ask only for the
minimum information necessary to help us process a subject access or deletion
request and will keep information pertaining to your request for up to two
years.
If you are a customer of ShareThis with a login and password to the
ShareThis platform, we ask that you first direct your request to the person or
persons at your organization that administers the relationship with ShareThis.</p>
<p>If you’d like to make a CCPA access or deletion request, please send an email to privacy@sharethis.com.
California data subjects may also call us on our toll free CCPA privacy hotline at 1-800-272-1765.</p>
<p>If you make a subject access request as set out in this policy,
you are entitled to see and delete the personal information that we have about
you including any digital identifiers such as cookie IDs and mobile advertising
IDs that ShareThis may store.
We will confirm your request within 10 days and
make a good faith attempt to fulfill your request within 45 days.</p>
<p>Under the CCPA, your request to see the personal information that
we have about you may include: (1) specific pieces of personal information that
we may have about you.
(2) categories of personal information we have collected
about you.
(3) categories of sources from which the personal information is
collected.
(4) categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for
a business purpose about you.
(5) categories of third parties to whom the
personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose under the
CCPA.
and (6) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling
personal information.
Most of this information is described at least generally
in our privacy policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Verifying Data Subject Access and
Deletion Requests</strong>
</p>
<p>We may take steps to verify your request and may require you to
demonstrate or attest via affidavit that you own or control the computer or
device from which you are making such requests – particularly where you are
seeking access to or deletion of pseudonymous personal information such as
digital identifiers.</p>
<p>We will fulfill requests we are able to verify so long as we are
not prohibited from doing so by applicable law and/or the information is not
essential to us for billing, fraud prevention or security purposes.
We will
share our reason(s) for denying your request in the event that we are unable to
fulfill your request.
If we are unable to fulfil your deletion request, we may
invite you to make a request to opt-out at our privacy policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Access and Deletion Requests made via
Authorized Agents</strong>
</p>
<p>You may make an access or deletion request via an authorized agent
by having such agent follow the process below.
Please note that we will request
any authorized agent demonstrate that they have been authorized by you to make
a request on your behalf.
And we will verify your request and/or require you to
complete an affidavit as described above.
We request that any authorized agent
provide us with contact details such as an email address and phone number so
that we may ensure a timely response to the consumer.</p>Data Sharing or Disclosure, Recipients of Your DataAdditional Information<p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>GDPR and Swiss Privacy Shield:</strong>
</p>
<p>ShareThis, Inc.
is committed to protecting data and enabling individual privacy rights in every location we do business.
Therefore, we comply with the GDPR and the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>
<p>In accordance with the GDPR, which is designed to empower and protect the data privacy rights of EU individuals, ShareThis makes available user consent tools (ShareThis is a registered CMP with the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework), as well as facilitating user data rights outlined throughout this notice.<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>User Choices and Opt-out Rights<p>If you do not want to receive advertisements based on Usage Data and Profile Information collected by ShareThis on your current browser, you can change and manage your preferences in relation to the collection and processing of Usage Data and Profile Information by clicking the ShareThis opt-out button available on this privacy policy.
When data subjects opt-out, ShareThis will stop transferring data about their browser or device to third parties but does not otherwise treat those users differently.</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive ads based on Usage Data collected by ShareThis whatever device or browser used, you must opt-out from our services for each device and each internet web browser.&nbsp;<br>
</p>Opt-Out of Data Collection and Sharing<p>
<strong>Click below to “Limit Ad-Tracking” function on mobile devices:</strong>
</p>
<p>Instructions by Google for most Androids: Google Play Help</p>
<p>Instructions by Apple for iOS version 6 and above: Apple Support Center</p> Additional Information<p>Furthermore:</p>
<p>This process does not mean you will stop seeing advertisements, but that the advertisements you do see will not be influenced by the Usage Data collected and Profile Information used by ShareThis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions about your opt-out rights, you can write to us at&nbsp;privacy@sharethis.com.</p>
<p>
<strong>Browser environment:</strong> (desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)</p>
<p>When you change your consents or opt out, an opt-out cookie will be set on your browser.
We must maintain the opt-out cookie on your browser in order to recognize you as having opted out from our service.
The ShareThis opt-out cookie is like any other cookie.
therefore, if you clear that cookie from your browser, use a different internet browser, or use a new computer to access the internet you must go through the process again.</p>
<p>You can also opt out by visiting the following links.</p>
<p>Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Opt-Out Platform</p>
<p>Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Opt-Out Platform</p>
<p>European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) Opt-Out Platform</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Ghostery browser extension&nbsp;is also a good tool to see a list of all third-party cookies on each website you visit and allows you to selectively opt out.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
</p>
<p>The opt-out tools above are currently cookie-based ie they set a cookie on your browser which tells us that you have opted out.
This means that the opt-out will only function if your browser is set to accept third party cookies.
If your browser is set to automatically reject cookies or if you remove all cookies from your browser, the opt-out mechanism will not work since we would not see an opt-out cookie on your browser.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that cookies are browser based, therefore if you change browsers, operating systems or computers you would need to opt out again.</p>
<p>
<strong>Mobile environment:</strong>
</p>
<p>While the opt-out methods described above often work for mobile web browsing, they are cookie-based and are therefore less reliable in mobile “app” environments that may not accept interest-based advertising cookies.</p>
<p>Instead, you can typically opt out at the mobile platform level by the “limit ad tracking” function within the settings, as described below.
Though we do not collect data from mobile apps for interest-based advertising, we or third parties we work with may use such data collected by others in delivering interest-based ads.</p>
<p>
<strong>Most Android Users:</strong>
</p>
<p>To use the “opt-out of interest-based advertising” option, follow the instructions provided by Google here:&nbsp;Google Play Help.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a device setting and will disable interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for ShareThis.</p>
<p>
<strong>iOS users:</strong> (version 6 and above)</p>
<p>To use the “Limit Ad-Tracking” option, follow the instructions provided by Apple here:&nbsp;Apple Support Center.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a device setting and will disable interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for ShareThis.</p>
<p>
<strong>Do Not Track:</strong>
</p>
<p>You may also stop the collection of your Usage Data by using the do-not-track function of your browser.
ShareThis recognizes these do-not-track signals from your browser.
As required by law, or where we are able to ascertain that such signals are enacted by you and not set by default by your browser, we will consider them to be an indication that you have opted out.</p>
<p>
<strong>Onward Transfer/Privacy Shield:</strong>
</p>
<p>ShareThis complies with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S.
