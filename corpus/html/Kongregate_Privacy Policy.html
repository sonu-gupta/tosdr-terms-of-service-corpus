This aggregate information does not include personal data and cannot be linked to you.

</li>
<li>
<p>

How Long We Retain Your Personal Data <p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide our Services to you and fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
We do periodic status checks to review when personal data needs to be deleted.
However, as we process your personal data for various purposes, the actual period for which the personal data will be stored will depend on the circumstances.
For example, we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed your account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.
When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we cannot identify you.</p>
<p>While we endeavor to honor your requests related to your personal data, we may not be fully able
to honor the request until a later time or we may deny your deletion request if retaining the
information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or
service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our
ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;</li>
<li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or
prosecute those responsible for such activities;</li>
<li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</li>
<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights,
or exercise another right provided for by law;</li>
<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code § 1546 et.
seq.);</li>
<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public
interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s
deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you
previously provided informed consent;</li>
<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on
your relationship with us;</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation.
and/or</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context
in which you provided it.</li>
</ul> 5.
How We Protect Your Information <p>We strive to maintain the security of your personal information through a variety of security measures.
Safeguarding your personal data is a priority for us.
Personal data that you provide to us is stored on secure servers, and we use rigorous procedures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data.
Although we work hard to protect your personal data, please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal data, and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.</p>
<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to any login or password information, and to your computer or device.
To minimize the risk of having your account being compromised, we recommend that you set up your account password using unique numbers, letters and special characters.
Do not disclose passwords to others.
Please notify us of any password compromises and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection.
To learn more about how to protect yourself online, we encourage you to visit the government’s website at www.onguardonline.gov</p> 6.
Our Policies Concerning Children <p>

<p>For our limited collection of Kid-Appealing Games, we recognize a special obligation to further protect personal information collected from Children.
We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission.
Some of the features of our Kid-Appealing Games are age-gated so that they are not available for use by Children.
When we intend to collect personal information from Children, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notifying&nbsp.
parents &nbsp;about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>With the exception of a handful or so of our Kid-Appealing Games, Children should not attempt to create an account or send any of your information to us, including your name, address, telephone number or email address.
If Kongregate learns that we have collected personal information from Children without verification of parental consent in contravention of these measures, we will terminate access to the account immediately and will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or other as required or allowed by law).
