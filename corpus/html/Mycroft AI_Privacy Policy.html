<p>### Cookies.<br>

Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service.

web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors and users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.
We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>
<p>### Third Party Analytics.<br>
We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Application.

We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Please be aware no data security measures can guarantee security.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.</p>
