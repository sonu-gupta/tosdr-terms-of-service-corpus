         Privacy Policy
<p>
Let's keep this simple:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Your email will only be used for account notifications,
we don't spam or sell email addresses.
</li>
<li>
All the apps in our directory are user-requested and useful.
We do not list
malware or other shady apps.
</li>
<li>
We install apps like you would: with default settings and
we say "no" to all browser toolbars and other junk.
</li>
<li>
Some apps are tagged with a Ninite affiliate key.
Ninite receives a
commission when users upgrade those apps.
</li>
<li>
After installing apps non-identifying diagnostic information (OS version, language, machine architecture, failure status of installers) is reported back to Ninite so we can improve reliability.
</li>
<li>
Ninite Pro uses a meaningless hash of the first MAC address on a machine to count unique machines where a Pro account is used.
This is transmitted when Ninite gets the latest app configurations from our server.
</li>
<li>
All we do is install the apps you choose.
With our free version or Ninite Pro Classic not even Ninite is installed.
</li>
<li>
And, of course, we do not include any form of malware or spyware.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please send us an email
if you have further questions.
