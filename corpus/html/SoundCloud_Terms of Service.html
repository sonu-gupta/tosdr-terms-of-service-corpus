Description of the Platform
<p>The Platform is a hosting service.
Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (<strong>"Content"</strong>), which will be stored by SoundCloud at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Platform and accessible via the Website, Apps and elsewhere.
The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to discussions, and enables any user of the Website, Apps or certain Services (who may or may not be registered users of the Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.</p>
<p>The Platform also includes social and interactive features that enable users to engage with and learn from the SoundCloud community in order to build a following and ensure you get the content that interests you most.
For example, users who upload content to SoundCloud will gain access to our creator stats feature, which provides creators with insights into how the content they upload fares among users, including which users are top listeners and downloaders of such content.</p>
<p>Some features of our Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a certain Service (see Subscriptions and Gift Codes below).
SoundCloud however remains free for users that choose not to subscribe to such Services.
In order to make the Platform available for free and provide you with personally relevant features, we serve tailored ads on the Platform on behalf of third party advertisers.
To that end, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform to inform the nature of the ads we show you and provide you with a customized experience.
More information on how we use data to show you personalized ads is described in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, release new versions of our Apps, or introduce other services and/or features for the Platform.
Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms and conditions that we may release for those specific services or features.</p>
Your SoundCloud account
<p>You are not obliged to register to use the Platform.
However, access to the Apps and certain Services is only available to registered users.
As an example, our App, SoundCloud Pulse, enables registered users, who upload and make available their Content to other users, to receive instant feedback on the performance of their tracks, communicate with their listeners, and manage their Content anytime.</p>
<p>In order for you to engage with other SoundCloud listeners and creators, we enable you to create and personalize a public profile on SoundCloud.
To enable you to do that, you must provide us with the information you want to display on such profile.</p>
<p>In order to help you to navigate and discover content on the Platform that interests you, as a registered user you will also receive auto-generated personalized recommendations of other content that might appeal to you, based on your listening habits.</p>
<p>When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, and will choose a username and password for your account.
You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid.
Your email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password, and you will remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account, whether or not such activity was authorized by you.</p>
<p>If your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your account has been accessed by unauthorized third parties, you are advised to notify SoundCloud in writing, and should change your password at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames and permalinks in appropriate circumstances, as determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable laws or regulations.</p>
<p>You may terminate your account at any time as described in the Termination section below.</p>

To the extent it is necessary in order for SoundCloud to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use, including the distribution of advertising or other promotional material on our Platform and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licenses to SoundCloud on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis.</p>

Licenses with respect to audio Content, and any images or text within your account, will (subject to the following paragraph of these Terms of Use) terminate automatically when you remove such Content from your account.
Licenses with respect to comments or other contributions that you make on the Platform will be perpetual and irrevocable, and will continue notwithstanding any termination of your account.</p>
<p>Removal of audio Content from your account will automatically result in the deletion of the relevant files from SoundCloud’s systems and servers.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that once Your Content is distributed to a Linked Service, SoundCloud is not obligated to ensure the deletion of Your Content from any servers or systems operated by the operators of any Linked Service, or to require that any user of the Platform or any Linked Service deletes any item of Your Content.
Furthermore, if you authorize any of Your Content to be available for offline listening, after deletion of an item of Your Content or removal from the ability for other users to listen to the applicable Content offline, the applicable Content may still be temporarily available to other users of the Platform who saved the applicable Content for offline listening on their devices, but no longer than 30 days from the time of deletion.</p>
<p>Any Content other than Your Content is the property of the relevant Uploader, and is or may be subject to copyright, trademark rights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights.

Data protection, privacy and cookies
<p>All personal data that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Platform is collected, stored, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by SoundCloud in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
In addition, in common with most online services, we use cookies to help us understand how people are using the Platform, so that we can continue to improve the service we offer.
Our use of cookies, and how to disable cookies, is explained in our Cookies Policy.</p>
Meetups
<p>SoundCloud has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at venues all over the world (<strong>"Meetups"</strong>).
While SoundCloud is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded promotional materials to help organizers promote their Meetups, SoundCloud does not sponsor, oversee or in any way control such Meetups.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups is entirely at your own risk and SoundCloud does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any SoundCloud users or any third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.</p>
Competitions and other promotions
<p>From time to time, some SoundCloud® users may promote competitions, promotions, prize draws and other similar opportunities on the Platform (<strong>"Third Party Competitions"</strong>).
SoundCloud is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any promotion of these Third Party Competitions.
If you wish to participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.</p>
<p>If you wish to run your own Third Party Competition on the Platform, you are free to do so provided you comply with our Competition Terms, which are available here.</p>
Use of SoundCloud players and widget
<p>The Platform includes access to customizable players (<strong>"Players"</strong>), and an embeddable version of the SoundCloud waveform player (<strong>"Widget"</strong>) for incorporation into users’ own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service.
This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader.</p>
<p>You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part.
Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and you are the person or are authorized to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre.
You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget.
The foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.</p>
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason at its sole discretion.</p>
Subscriptions and gift codes
<p>Certain features of the Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a "Pro" or "Next Pro" plan (together, <strong>"Pro Accounts"</strong>) or to SoundCloud Go (Pro Accounts and SoundCloud Go are each referred to as a <strong>"Subscription"</strong>).</p>
<p>The purchase of Pro Accounts and gift codes related to Pro Accounts is subject to additional terms, which you will find here.
In addition, the purchase of subscriptions for SoundCloud Go is subject to additional terms, which you will find here.</p>
<p>The Pro Account Terms and the SoundCloud Go Terms include, amongst other things, terms relating to payment, the conclusion, renewal and cancellation of your Subscription, including your right of cancellation during the first 14 days of your Subscription, and certain technical usage limitations.</p>
<p>The Pro Account Terms are applicable to Pro and Next Pro Account users and the SoundCloud Go Terms are applicable to SoundCloud Go users in addition to these general Terms of Use when they purchase a Subscription.
SoundCloud reserves the right to limit the availability of SoundCloud Go subscriptions to specific jurisdictions as may be determined by SoundCloud in its sole discretion from time to time.</p>
Changes to the Platform, accounts and pricing
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only.
In the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access, SoundCloud shall use its reasonable endeavors to notify registered users of such decision in advance.</p>
<p>You hereby agree that SoundCloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to the Website, Apps and/or any Services that SoundCloud may wish to make from time to time, or for any decision to suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or access the same from or within any territory or territories.</p>
<p>SoundCloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its Subscriptions from time to time.
In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any Subscription which you have purchased, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your subscription.
In all other cases, where SoundCloud proposes to make changes to any type of Subscription you have purchased, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, SoundCloud will notify you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your SoundCloud® account and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance.
You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your Subscription.</p>
Termination
<p>You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to SoundCloud at Rheinsberger Str.
76/77, 10115 Berlin, Germany confirming such termination, by removing all of Your Content from your account, or by deleting your account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform.
If you have a Subscription, and terminate this Agreement before the end of such Subscription, we are unable to offer any refund for any unexpired period of your Subscription.</p>
<p>SoundCloud may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are deemed to be a Repeat Infringer as described above.

You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account before terminating your account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably deleted following any termination of your account.
SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation.
This data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account is active.</p>
<p>If you access the Platform via any of our Apps or via any third party app connected to your account, deleting that app will not delete your account.
If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account page within your Settings on the Website.
