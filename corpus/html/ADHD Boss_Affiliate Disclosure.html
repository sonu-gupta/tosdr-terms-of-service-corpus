<p>ADHD Boss is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to (“ADHD Boss” (amazon.com, or endless.com, MYHABIT.com, SmallParts.com, or AmazonWireless.com).</p>
<p>In other words, some of the links on this website contain&nbsp;affiliate ID’s.</p>
<p>This means that I may&nbsp;receive a commission <strong>at no additional cost to you</strong> when you purchase a product, or click on an advertisement associated&nbsp;with ADHD Boss.</p>
<p>I will almost always link to products that I have personally used, and have&nbsp;benefited&nbsp;from&nbsp;first-hand.</p>
<p>On occasion, I will link to a product that I have not yet used if I&nbsp;believe that it will add genuine value to your life.</p>
<p>I’ll normally only do this if I’m familiar with the brand or product line.</p>
<p>This works out to be a win-win for all.
I will do my best to provide you with products that add legitimate value to your life, and you’ll also be able to support ADHDBoss.com at no additional cost to you.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
