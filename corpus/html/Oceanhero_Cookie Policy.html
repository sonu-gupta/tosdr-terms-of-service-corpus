<strong>What about other tracking technologies, like webbeacons?</strong>
</p>
<p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
We mayuse other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimescalled "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").
These are tiny graphics files that contain aunique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited ourWebsites or opened an e-mail including them.
This allows us, for example, tomonitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, todeliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to thewebsite from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, toimprove site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketingcampaigns.
In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies tofunction properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</strong>
</p>
<p>Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local SharedObjects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information aboutyour use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust thesettings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the toolscontained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.
You can also control FlashCookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following theinstructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how todelete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site),how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without yourbeing asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies thatare not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of FlashCookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications,including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services oronline content.</p>
