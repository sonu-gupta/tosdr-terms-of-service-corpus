Refund policy <p>Cancelation &amp.
refund information</p> Cancellation Policy <p>IFastNet.com (IFastNet LTD) believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy.
Under this policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 7 days of placing an order.
However, the cancellation request will not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of provisioning services.
</li>
<li>Cancelations must be communicated to Ifastnet.com a minimum of 14 days before the service is due.
Failure to cancel before this period is acceptance of renewal of the service.
</li>
</ul> Refund Policy <p>When you buy our products/services, your purchase is covered by our 7-day money-back guarantee.
If you are, for any reason, not entirely happy with your purchase, we will cheerfully issue a full refund.
We develop and sell software that we use ourselves every day and have thousands of satisfied customers worldwide, and our support is second to none.
That is why we can afford to back our products with this special guarantee.</p>
<p>To request a refund, simply contact us with your purchase details within seven (7) days of your purchase.
Please include your order number (sent to you via email after ordering) and optionally tell us why you’re requesting a refund – we take customer feedback very seriously and use it to constantly improve our products and quality of service.
Refunds are not being provided for services delivered in full such as installation service and provided knowledge base hosting service.
Refunds are being processed within a 7 day period.</p>
<p>If a service is canceled and a refund requested, the cost incurred of renewing or providing a free domain name (if included with the service being canceled ) will be minused from the refund amount (this could sometimes lead to a negative value).</p>
<p>
<i>
</i> Domain name renewal / registration fees and costs are non-refundable.</p>
