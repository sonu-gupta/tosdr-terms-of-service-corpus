<p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<p>WRITERDUET INC.
will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
No transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.
For more information, see below “Transferring your Personal Information Out of the EEA” and “Your Rights Under the GDPR”.</p>Transferring Your Personal Data Out of the EEA.<p>To deliver services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>With our offices outside the EEA;</li>
<li>With your and our service providers located outside the EEA;</li>
<li>If you are based outside the EEA.
or</li>
<li>Where there is an international dimension to the services we are providing to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>These transfers are subject to special rules under European and UK data protection law.</p>
<p>Non-EEA countries do not have the same data protection laws as the United Kingdom and EEA.
We will, however, ensure the transfer complies with data protection law and all personal information will be secure.
Our standard practice is to use standard data protection contract clauses that have been approved by the European Commission.
To obtain a copy of those clauses, visit the European Commission website at https://ec.europa.eu/ and search for "standard contractual clauses".</p>
<p>If you would like further information, please contact us (see “How To Contact Us” below).</p>Your Rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<p>The GDPR gives people under its protection, including people in the EEA and the United Kingdom, certain rights with respect to their personal data collected by us.
Accordingly, WRITERDUET INC.
recognizes and will comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law.
The rights under GDPR include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Right of Access.</i> This includes your right to access the personal data we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security, and processing of that data.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Correction.</i> This is your right to request correction of your personal data.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Erasure.</i> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal data be erased from our possession (also known as the “Right to be forgotten”).
However, if applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your data, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using the Service and may result in closing your account.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Complain.</i> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal data with the appropriate supervisory authority.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Restrict Processing.</i> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal data is used or processed.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Object.</i>This is your right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal data is processed.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Portability.</i> This is your right to receive the personal data we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</i> This is your right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.
This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
</ul>
