HUBSPOT CRM AND FREE SERVICES<br>
</strong>
<p>1.1&nbsp.
HubSpot CRM Subscription Fees</p>
<p>HubSpot CRM, which includes ‘lite’ versions of select features in our paid products, is one of our free services.
As such, there are no Subscription Fees associated with your use of the HubSpot CRM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there’s no charge for contacts in the CRM, if you subscribe to Marketing Hub, you will be charged for contacts as part of your fee for that product, even if they are added through the HubSpot CRM.
If you use the HubSpot CRM or any of our Free Services, we will make those services available to you free of charge until earlier of (a) the date on which your free subscription is terminated or (b) the start date of your paid subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2 Email Send Limit</p>
<p>For the HubSpot CRM, if you only use our Free Services, the CRM Email Send Limit is equal to a maximum of two-thousand (2,000) (the "HubSpot CRM Email Sent Limit").</p>
<p>If you reach your HubSpot CRM Email Send Limit, you will not be able to send any more emails until the start of the next calendar month, including emails pre-scheduled to go out after reaching the HubSpot CRM Email Send Limit.&nbsp.
Kick-back emails from form conversion will not be interrupted.
You may not increase your HubSpot CRM Email Send Limit.</p>
<p>1.3&nbsp.
Limits</p>
<p>We may change the limits that apply to your use of the HubSpot CRM or Free Services at any time in our sole discretion without notice to you, regardless of whether or not these are used in conjunction with other products or services for which you pay us a fee.</p>
<p>1.4&nbsp.
Modifications</p>
<p>We may make changes to the HubSpot CRM or Free Services that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during the Subscription Term.</p>
<p>1.5&nbsp.
Non-Renewal Notice Period</p>
<p>To prevent continuation of the Subscription Term of a free subscription, you or we may close your account.</p>
<p>1.6&nbsp.
Retrieval of Customer Data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the HubSpot CRM and Free Services, we will not provide you with any access to Customer Data after termination or expiration of your subscription.
If you want to retain any Customer Data after your Subscription Term ends, we recommend you export that data from your HubSpot account in advance.</p>
<p>1.7 Unified Database.</p>
<p>By using HubSpot CRM with other parts of the Subscription Service, you understand that all Contact Information will be stored in a unified database of Contacts associated with your subscription, and that all workflows you use will pull from this unified list of Contacts.
While there’s no charge for Contacts in HubSpot CRM, if you subscribe to our Marketing Hub Professional or Marketing Hub Enterprise products, you will be charged for Contacts as part of your fee for those products, even if they are added through HubSpot CRM and whether or not there is an email address associated with a Contact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>2.&nbsp.
MARKETING HUB</strong>
<br>
<p>In October 2020, HubSpot introduced a new contacts pricing model for Marketing Hub called ‘Marketing Contacts’.&nbsp.
Customers who purchase one of our Marketing Contacts Products (defined below) will only pay for the contacts to which they want to send marketing emails and target ads, and they can store up to one million Non-Marketing Contacts for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marketing Contacts pricing model will be available to all new Marketing Hub customers on October 21, 2020.
If you purchase any of our Marketing Contacts Products, the Marketing Hub terms in Section 2.1 below will apply to your subscription.</p>
<p>Existing Marketing Hub customers with legacy contacts pricing will have the option on renewal to either (i) renew their existing Marketing Hub subscription or (ii) switch to the new Marketing Contacts pricing model when it is made available.&nbsp.
If you’re an existing Marketing Hub customer and you decide to remain on your existing contacts pricing model, the Marketing Hub terms in Section 2.2 below will apply to your subscription.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.1&nbsp.
Marketing Hub (with Marketing Contacts)</strong>
</p>
<p>The terms in this section 2.1 apply to any purchase of the following products: Marketing Contacts Products as defined below.</p>
<p>2.1.1&nbsp.
Definitions</p>
<p>“Marketing Contacts” means Contacts that are able to receive marketing emails and be targeted with ads, and are designated as Marketing Contacts in your HubSpot account<em>.</em>
</p>
<p>“Marketing Contacts Products” means</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing Hub Starter - Marketing Contacts.
</li>
<li>Marketing Hub Professional - Marketing Contacts.
and</li>
<li>Marketing Hub Enterprise - Marketing Contacts;</li>
</ul>
<p>as further described in the Product and Services Catalog, and including any additional Marketing Contacts that you may purchase with the above products (such as Starter Marketing Contacts, Professional Marketing Contacts, and Enterprise Marketing Contacts).
Details of Your Marketing Contacts subscription will be set out on your Order Form.</p>
<p>"Maximum Contacts" means the maximum number of Marketing Contacts you are permitted to use with the Subscription Service as identified in your Order Form, plus any Marketing Contacts added as part of an upgrade.</p>
<p>“Non-Marketing Contacts” means Contacts that are not designated as marketing-eligible by you in your HubSpot account.
You cannot target Non-Marketing Contacts with marketing emails or ads.</p>
<p>Terms not otherwise defined here will have the meaning as set out in the Master Terms.</p>
<p>2.1.2&nbsp.
Marketing Contacts Products Email Send Limit</p>
<p>For Marketing Hub Enterprise - Marketing Contacts, the Email Send Limit is equal to twenty (20) times the Maximum Contacts number per month.
For Marketing Hub Professional - Marketing Contacts, the Email Send Limit is equal to ten (10) times the Maximum Contacts number per month.
For Marketing Hub Starter - Marketing Contacts, this limit is equal to five (5) times the Maximum Contacts number per calendar month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you reach your Email Send Limit, you may not be able to send any more emails.
You may increase your Email Send Limit by upgrading your Marketing Contacts edition or by purchasing a ‘Dedicated IP Add-on’ which includes unlimited email sends, in which case your fee will increase during the course of a Billing Period as described in the ‘Fee Adjustments’ section below.</p>
<p>2.1.3&nbsp.
Marketing Contacts Products Subscription Fees</p>
<p>The Subscription Fee for Marketing Contacts Products will remain fixed during the Subscription Term unless you:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) exceed your Maximum Contacts or other applicable limits set out on the Product and Services Catalog,</p>
<p>(ii) upgrade products or base packages,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iii) subscribe to additional features or products, including additional Marketing Contacts, or&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iv) unless otherwise agreed to in the Order.</p>
<p>For our Marketing Contacts Products, once increased, your Subscription Fee will not decrease, even if there is a subsequent reduction in the number of Marketing Contacts or emails sent.&nbsp.
​Your Subscription Fee will not increase if you add Contacts which are not designated as Marketing Contacts by you in your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about how your fees may be otherwise adjusted in the remainder of this 'Fees Adjustments' section below.</p>
<p>2.1.4.&nbsp.
Fee Adjustments</p>
<p>2.1.4.1 Contact Tiers.
Your Subscription Fee will increase immediately during the course of a Billing Period if you exceed your Maximum Contacts limit in a Billing Period.
In this case, the Subscription Fee will increase up to the tier price which corresponds with the number of Marketing Contacts and your invoice will increase by the corresponding prorated amount for the remainder of Subscription Term.
Tier prices for Marketing Contacts Products are as set out in the Product and Services Catalog.
You will receive an electronic notification (as described in the Notices section of our Master Terms) if you’re approaching your Marketing Contact tier limit.</p>
<p>You may manage your Marketing Contacts to avoid an increase in your Subscription Fee as set out in the ‘Managing Your Marketing Contacts’ section below.</p>
<p>2.1.4.2&nbsp.
Other Fee Adjustments.&nbsp.
For detail on renewal pricing, see the ‘Fees’ section of the Master Terms.&nbsp.
We may choose to decrease your fees upon written notice to you.</p>
<p>2.1.5&nbsp.
Managing Your Marketing Contacts</p>
<p>When you purchase a Marketing Contacts Product, you’ll have the opportunity to select which contacts you’d like to designate as Marketing Contacts, and which you want to designate as Non-Marketing Contacts.
We also recommend reviewing the designation of your Contacts regularly to avoid an unintended Contact tier upgrade fee.
All Users have permission to make Contact designations in the portal unless their right to do so is limited by you in the ‘Users and Teams’ settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re switching from one of our Marketing Hub Products with legacy contacts pricing to one of our Marketing Contacts Products, all Contacts will be designated Marketing Contacts by default.
We strongly recommend you complete the Eligibility Flow tool to designate your Non-Marketing Contacts before you switch to avoid an unintended Contact tier upgrade fee which will apply immediately and cannot be refunded.</p>
<p>We will monitor or audit remotely the number of Marketing Contacts in the Subscription Service and the number of emails that you send on the Subscription Service.
This information is also made available to you in your HubSpot account.</p>
<p>You can change your Contacts from Non-Marketing to Marketing Contacts at any time.
We allow you to designate Marketing Contacts as Non-Marketing’ Contacts at any time, but changes in designations to Non-Marketing will not take effect until the first day of the next month or on your subscription renewal date, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>2.1.6&nbsp.
Limits</p>
<p>For all Marketing Contacts Products and paid Add-Ons to those products, we may change the limits that apply to you at any time in our sole discretion by updating the Product and Services Catalog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the Product and Service Catalog and your Order for details of any additional limits that apply to your Marketing Contacts Product subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.1.7&nbsp.
Downgrades</p>
<p>For our Marketing Contacts Products, you may designate your contacts as Non-Marketing at any time (as described in the ‘Managing your Marketing Contacts’ section above), but you can only downgrade your contact tier at your next renewal date upon signature of a new Order.
In order to avoid additional charges, you should purchase the appropriate tier of Subscription Service for your anticipated needs.</p>
<p>2.1.8&nbsp.
Modifications</p>
<p>We will not make changes to the Marketing Hub Professional - Marketing Contacts, Marketing Hub Enterprise - Marketing Contacts and paid Add-Ons to these products that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during the Subscription Term.</p>
<p>We may make changes to our Marketing Hub Starter - Marketing Contacts product and Add-Ons to that product that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during the Subscription Term.</p>
<p>2.1.9&nbsp.
Notice of Non-Renewal</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in your Order, to prevent renewal of your Marketing Hub with Marketing Contacts subscription or paid Add-Ons to Marketing Hub with Marketing Contacts, you or we must give written notice of non-renewal and this written notice must be received before the next renewal period begins.</p>
<p>2.1.10&nbsp.
Retrieval of Customer Data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Marketing Hub Professional - Marketing Contacts and for Marketing Hub Enterprise - Marketing Contacts, if you make a written request within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of your subscription, we will provide you with temporary access to the Subscription Service to retrieve, or we will provide you with copies of, all Customer Data then in our possession or control.
If we provide you with temporary access to the account, we may charge a re-activation fee.
Thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of your Subscription, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide you the Customer Data.
We will delete all Customer Data in our systems or otherwise in our control unless (i) we are legally prohibited or (ii) save as set out in the ‘Deletion or Return of Personal Data’ section of the DPA, then such Personal Data shall be Processed in accordance with our DPA.</p>
<p>For Marketing Hub Starter - Marketing Contacts, we will not provide you with any access to Customer Data after termination or expiration of your subscription.
If you want to retain any Customer Data after your Subscription Term ends, we recommend you export that data from your HubSpot account in advance.</p>
<p>2.1.11&nbsp.
Legacy Marketing Hub Products</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ‘Legacy’ section of the HubSpot Master Terms, once you've purchased a Marketing Contacts Product, you cannot choose to re-purchase the Marketing Hub product with legacy contacts pricing, which bills differently for Contacts, even if it's still listed in our Product &amp.
Services Catalog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use one of our other legacy Marketing Hub products that is not listed in the Product Specific Terms, then the terms that apply to Marketing Hub Enterprise with legacy contacts pricing apply to your subscription.</p>
<p>2.1.12&nbsp.
Brand Domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to host multiple root domains associated with your company in a single HubSpot account, you must purchase a subscription to the Marketing Hub Enterprise - Marketing Contacts product with the Brand Domain add-on product.&nbsp.
A root domain is considered to be a different domain name that immediately precedes the top-level domain indicator.
For example, www.hubspot.com and www.inbound.com are considered separate root domains, whereas www.hubspot.com and blog.hubspot.com or www.hubspot.fr are not considered separate root domains.</p>

For Marketing Hub Starter, we complete this review on the last day of your Billing Period.
You may manage your Contacts to avoid an increase in your Subscription Fee as set out in the ‘Manage Contacts’ section below.</p>
<p>If the number of Contacts in your account exceed your Maximum Contacts when we complete this review, then your Subscription Fee will increase at the beginning of the next Billing Period up to the tier price which corresponds with the reviewed number of Contacts.
Tier prices are as set out in our Product and Services Catalog.</p>
<p>For Marketing Hub Starter, upon renewal, your subscription will be adjusted to match the Contact tier that corresponds with the number of Contacts in your portal on the last day of your then-current Subscription Term.&nbsp.

If you subscribe to&nbsp.

<p>We allow you to reasonably manage the number of Contacts during the course of a Billing Period and will not count Contacts removed before our review, unless these Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase.
If Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase, we may consider the maximum number of Contacts from the reviewed Billing Period for the purposes of determining your Contact tier.</p>
