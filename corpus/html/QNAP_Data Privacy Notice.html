<p>After receiving your request, we will evaluate your request and inform you how we intend to proceed with your request.
Under certain circumstances, in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations, we may withhold access to your data, or decline to modify, erase, port, or restrict the processing of your data.</p>
<p>Please be advised that if you exercise the rights to erase data, restrict or object to our processing, or to withdraw your consent, we may not be able to continue providing our services to you if the necessary data is missing for processing.</p> Transfer, storage, and processing of data abroad <p>As noted in the "Sharing your personal data" section of this Notice, as a globally operating company, we may share your information with our affiliate companies or third parties.
Please refer to the "Sharing your personal data" section of this Notice for the recipients of your data and the reasons for our provision of your data to them.
Where such entities are located in other countries and jurisdictions, we will therefore be transferring your personal data outside of the European Economic Area.
In making such data transfers, we make sure to protect your personal data by applying the level of security required by applicable privacy laws.
Where we transfer your data to a country or jurisdiction that cannot guarantee the required level of protection as required by applicable privacy laws, we have enhanced our IT security measures and have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with the transferee to require security obligations on the transferee, both of which are intended to increase the protection of your personal data.
SCCs are one of a number of "appropriate safeguards" under the applicable privacy laws that enable the transfer of personal data concerning data subjects within the European Economic Area to jurisdictions that have not been designated by the European Commission as possessing an adequate level of data protection.
You may request a copy of such SCCs from us, or inquire about transfers of your information, by providing your request to the contact window set forth in the "Whom should I contact?" section.</p> Further processing <p>If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose not covered by this Notice, then we will provide you with a new notice explaining this new use prior to commencing such further processing for a new purpose.
This new notice sets out the relevant new purpose and processing conditions.
In such a case, we will find a lawful basis for further processing, and whenever necessary, we will seek your prior written consent to such further processing.</p> Security <p>We protect your data using technical measures to minimize the risks of misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss or theft, and loss of access.
Some of the safeguards we use are data pseudonymization, data encryption, firewalls, and data access authorization controls.
We take our data security very seriously.
Therefore the security mechanisms used to protect your data are checked and updated regularly to provide effective protection against abuse.</p>
<p>The servers through which we collect your information are usually encoded using the encryption module of your browser, and are certified by renowned institutions for international encryption technique.
If necessary, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect your personal information.
Moreover, we have put in place additional and comprehensive state-of-the-art security measures every time your data are accessed through the internet.
Firewalls prevent unauthorized access.
Diverse encryption and identification layers protect your data from intrusion or disclosure to third parties during data transfer.
Furthermore, we internally use sophisticated encoding methods in order to prevent decoding by unauthorized persons.
Moreover, an electronic identifier is generated during data transfer to safeguard your information.</p>
<p>For your confidentiality and security, we use IDs and passwords to secure your personal information.
It is important for you to protect your ID, password, or any personal information.
Do not disclose your personal information, especially your password, to anyone.
