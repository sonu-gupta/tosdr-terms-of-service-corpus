<strong>Who we are</strong>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>2.
Glossary</strong>
</p>
<p>This section explains the terms used within this Privacy Notice whose meaning may not be immediately obvious.
Wherever we have used these terms in the Privacy Notice we have <strong>Bolded</strong> and Capitalized them to indicate that a definition for them is provided in this section.</p>
<ul>
<li>A<strong> Cookie</strong> is a packet of information sent by a server to a Web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses that server.
For example, they can be used to identify users and cache user preferences (such as but not limited to user selected graphics).</li>
<li>The <strong>Controller</strong> is the entity who determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data is to be collected and processed.
For the One Search services, Verizon Media EMEA Limited is the <strong>Controller</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Encryption</strong> is the process of changing electronic information or signals into a secret code (known as a cipher) so that it cannot be read or deciphered by anyone who does not have the key used to create the cipher.
The method(s) of <strong>Encryption</strong> that OneSearch Services use are described through this link.</li>
<li>
<strong>IP Address</strong> is a unique electronic address made up of a series of numbers which identifies the device or internet access point that you are using.
It is necessary in order to identify where information should be sent when a request over the Internet is made.</li>
<li>
<strong>Location Data</strong> is information derived from your <strong>IP Address</strong> to determine your general location.
We only use <strong>Location Data</strong> to provide you with useful location specific search results.
Although different levels of specificity of location can sometimes be inferred from <strong>IP Address</strong>es (e.g., country, state, city, zip code, house/office), we only infer <strong>Location Data</strong> at the city level of specificity unless you have specifically selected that we provide you with results to a zip code or similar, but still imprecise, level of specificity through the <strong>Set Location</strong>
<strong>Functionality</strong>.
We do not collect <strong>Location Data</strong> that is more specific than within a 500 meter radius.
It is also worth noting that your search results may also be tailored towards a specific location if you have confirmed a <strong>Search Query </strong>which indicates a location within it (e.g., if you search "Pizza Restaurants London").</li>
<li>
<strong>Network Traffic Protection</strong> is a general term to describe actions that we and our <strong>Search Provider</strong> take in order to protect users, our systems and the <strong>Search Provider's</strong> systems from harm and/or misuse.
Examples of the types of harm and misuse that the <strong>Search Provider </strong>and we are looking to protect against are hacking attacks and fraudulent clicks.
It is necessary to use a non-encrypted version of a user's <strong>IP Address</strong> to complete this purpose.</li>
<li>
<strong>Obfuscation</strong>, in relation to this Service, is a process of rendering an <strong>IP Address</strong> as no longer specific to a single device.
For example, if your IPv4 <strong>IP Address</strong> was 102.3.3.201, this could be obfuscated by dropping the last octet or byte of the address, making the <strong>IP Address</strong> 102.3.3.### (for example, 102.3.3.000).
After <strong>Obfuscation</strong>, your <strong>Search Query</strong> is no longer connected to you through your <strong>IP Address.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Personal Data</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“user” or “data subject”).
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</li>
<li>
<strong>Search Optimisation </strong>is a process whereby we work with our <strong>Search Partners</strong> to provide you with contextual advertisements and/or search results.
As part of the process of selecting what advertising to provide you <u>we do not</u> consider any of your previous search history or any other <strong>Personal Data</strong> that identifies you.
Rather, we only provide these contextual advertisements and/or search results based on <u>each individual search</u> that you perform.
For example, if you search for “flower shops” we may display an advertisement/search result for one or more flower shops.
We will sometimes provide your <strong>Search Query</strong> and/or your general location to certain <strong>Search Partners</strong> in order to provide you with advertisements/search results but the information they receive is never identifiable to you as we do not provide your <strong>IP Address</strong> to any <strong>Search Partners</strong> (unless you identify yourself in the <strong>Search Query</strong> or through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong>, for example by inputting your name or entering your home address).</li>
<li>
<strong>Search Provider</strong> is our third party that provides results in response to your <strong>Search Query</strong>.
They are not provided with your <strong>Personal Data </strong>unless you identify yourself in the <strong>Search Query</strong> or click on a sponsored search result through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> (e.g., by inputting your name or entering your home address).</li>
<li>
<strong>Search Partners</strong> are our third-parties that provide advertising, content, and additional search results.
They are not provided with your <strong>Personal Data</strong> unless you identify yourself in the <strong>Search Query</strong> or click on sponsored content through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> (e.g., by inputting your name or entering your home address).</li>
<li>
<strong>Search Query</strong> are the characters that you input into OneSearch (e.g., by entering text into the search field or selecting a suggested term of interest).</li>
<li>
<strong>Search Stack</strong> is a general term we use to describe the internal systems used to provide the OneSearch Service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> is the optional ability you have to select a more specific or different location for which you would like your search results to automatically be tailored.
You may choose a city location or you may choose a zip code or similar, but still imprecise, level of specificity.
We do not collect <strong>Location Data</strong> that is more specific than within a 500 meter radius.
The location you selected does not have to relate to your actual location (e.g., you may wish to search for restaurants in an area you will be travelling to soon).
This functionality resets each time you close a OneSearch browser session (i.e., your location selection will not be remembered the next time you use OneSearch).</li>
<li>
<strong>User Agent</strong> is the term we use for data about the software and hardware that is being used when a user makes a search.
For example, this can include data about the browser, operating system, type of computer and/or app that is being used to make a search.
The collection of this data is necessary to properly provide the service to different types of software and hardware being used (e.g., so that search results are provided on a mobile phone friendly interface when a search comes from a mobile phone) and for <strong>Network Traffic Protection</strong> purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3.
What Data Do We Collect, How We Use It and Why We Do This</strong>
</p>
<p>In this section we describe what <strong>Personal Data</strong> we collect, why we collect it and how we process it.
When you make a search no <strong>Personal Data</strong> will be transferred to our <strong>Search Provider</strong> or any <strong>Search Partner</strong> unless you identify yourself or anyone else in the <strong>Search Query</strong>.</p>
<p>When you input a <strong>Search Query</strong> into the OneSearch Service your <strong>IP Address</strong>, the <strong>Search Query</strong> and <strong>User Agent</strong> will be securely transferred from your browser to our <strong>Search Stack</strong>.</p>
<p>We need to process your <strong>IP Address</strong>, <strong>User Agent</strong> and <strong>Search Query</strong> together to fulfil your search.
We derive your imprecise <strong>Location Data</strong> from your <strong>IP Address </strong>so that we can tailor the search results to you and your location.
The provision of this limited data is necessary to provide the OneSearch Service to you and if it is not provided we will not be able to perform the OneSearch Service.</p>
<p>We will also process your location when you choose to give it to us using the<strong> Set Location Functionality</strong>.
We do this so that we can provide location specific search results (e.g., if you search "flower shops" then flower shops in your city or area may be provided in the results).</p>
<p>When we fulfil a search request we will transfer your <strong>Obfuscated IP Address</strong>, <strong>Search Query</strong> and<strong> User Agent</strong> to our <strong>Search Provider</strong> to process.
Our <strong>Search Provider</strong> is not able to link a <strong>Search Query </strong>back to you, as your <strong>IP Address</strong> is <strong>Obfuscated </strong>before we send it to them.</p>
<p>We may also carry out <strong>Search Optimization</strong>, by including information from <strong>Search Partners </strong>who receive your <strong>Search Query</strong> and general geolocation.
We then provide search results to your browser so that you can see them.</p>
<p>Very shortly (i.e., within seconds) after a <strong>Search Query</strong> has been completed, we will store your <strong>IP Address</strong>, <strong>Search Query</strong> and <strong>User Agent</strong> in different servers in such a way that they should not be capable of being connected.
From that point we are not able to tell what <strong>IP Address</strong> any <strong>Search Query</strong> has come from.
The only <strong>Personal Data</strong> which we then hold about you is your <strong>IP Address, </strong>unless you have identified yourself in the <strong>Search Query</strong> or through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> (e.g., by inputting your name or home address).</p>
<p>When you make a search we also process your <strong>IP Address</strong> for the purpose of <strong>Network Traffic Protection</strong>.
We continue to store and process your <strong>IP Address</strong> for this purpose for four days.
After this we permanently delete your <strong>IP Address</strong>.
Any <strong>Personal Data</strong> provided through a <strong>Search Query</strong> or through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> may be stored for a longer period, in accordance with general retention criteria for those functions.</p>
<p>The <strong>Search Provider</strong> stores the <strong>User Agent</strong>, <strong>Search Query</strong>, and <strong>Obfuscated</strong>
<strong>IP Address</strong> information we send to them for a period of time.
If you click on a sponsored search result (identified as an ad), the <strong>Search Provider</strong> will collect your <strong>IP Address</strong>.
Similarly, if you click on sponsored content from a <strong>Search Partner</strong>, the <strong>Search Partner</strong> may collect your <strong>IP Address</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.

<strong>5.
Encryption and short term storage of browser history</strong>
</p>
<p>When you click the search button, the URL of the webpage that comes up on your browser with your search results will be encrypted so the term(s) you have searched for will not be found in, or identifiable from, the URL.
Certain of the information contained in the URL relates to a Where on Earth ID which is a numerical value that can be associated with a generalised geolocation relating to the target location of your search.
This URL expires after an hour, eliminating your search history.
Further information about this part of the Service, and the <strong>Encryption</strong> used, can be found here<u>.

<p>
<strong>9.
International data processing</strong>
</p>
<p>Any <strong>Personal Data</strong> that you provide to us when interacting with our Services will be transferred to the USA.
In the event a user enters <strong>Personal Data</strong> as a <strong>Search Query</strong> or through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong>, then this <strong>Personal Data</strong> may be transferred to or another country where we have engaged a <strong>Search Provider, Search Partner</strong> or from which we operate the Service.</p>
<p>Some countries that are not located within the EEA may be recognized by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection.
For transfers from the EEA to countries that are not considered as adequate by the European Commission, such as the USA, we have put in place measures and safeguards to protect your personal information.
In particular when we transfer information to the USA we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses.
The Standard Contractual Clauses are available through the European Commission here and you may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses which we have entered into with the entities processing your data by contacting us (note that certain commercial information may be redacted).</p>

Change in</strong>
<strong>ownership </strong>
</p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of Verizon, Verizon Media or the OneSearch Service is proposed to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, as we only store the complete <strong>IP Address</strong> for four days for Network Traffic Protection, we most likely would not transfer <strong>Personal Data </strong>as described in Sections 2 and 3 above to the new (or prospective) owner as part of the transfer of OneSearch.
We will notify you of any such changes in advance.</p>
