<strong>Any dispute, claim, or controversy relating in any way to these Terms of Use (including interpretation or application of this section and questions of arbitrability), to your use of any Services, or to any products or services sold or distributed by the Company or through </strong>
<strong>naturesbounty.com </strong>
<strong>will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, </strong>except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
<strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award all remedies (<u>except for class, consolidated, or representative action remedies)</u> to which a Party is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Use as a court would.</strong>

<p>
<strong>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted on an individual basis only, and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS </strong>

<p>
<u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law:</u> The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.
The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org.
The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>
<p>
<u>Arbitration Process:</u> As specified in the AAA’s rules, to begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a written Demand for Arbitration that describes your claim and the relief you seek to our registered agent at Corporation Service Company, 80 State Street, Albany, NY, 12207.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
Likewise, the Company will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.<br>
</p>
