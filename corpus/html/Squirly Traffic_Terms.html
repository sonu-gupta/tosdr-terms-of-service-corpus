<b>
<u>REFERRAL COMMISSIONS AND
GAMBLING COMMISSIONS<br>
</u>
</b>Squirly Traffic
pays Upgraded Members
for Direct Referral Purchases known as Referral Commissions<br>
Squirly Traffic does not pay cash for just Clicking prizes
(Gambling) Win/Claim Commissions<br>
<br> Terms
Update 02/19/2017<br> Beginning
Feb.19th 2017 New Payout Terms Apply To ALL Member Levels:<br>
Any member who is owed commissions and requests a cash payout, must
have generated 50% of these earnings from Referral Purchases
in order to receive a cash payout.
<br>
Squirly Traffic cannot continue paying members who just surf for cash
and expect to be paid.
If you promote Squirly Traffic and generate
sales from your direct referrals then we are happy to share the bounty,
BUT we cannot continue to operate by paying members who only
surf for cash and nothing more.
These new terms apply to all
commissions regardless of when they were earned.<br>
<br>
Under these new terms to receive commissions payments we are removing
the must be upgraded requirement to be paid, in turn the commissions
percentages will be adjusted per member level, and at least 50% of your
commissions owed must be earned from your direct referrals purchases.<br>
For example: If you are owed $10.00 in commissions at least $5.00 of
those commissions MUST have come from your direct referrals purchases
in order to be paid.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is simply, If you have no earnings from referrals
purchases then you don't get paid.
<br>
