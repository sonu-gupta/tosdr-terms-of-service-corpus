to the content aggregated within the Collections </b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may freely choose to aggregate any content into any Collection
that is published in the Account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users must however check the content that they choose to make available
and must not publish a Collection that aggregates content:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
That can be construed as an apology for crimes against
humanity or war crimes;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
That violates the respect and dignity of human beings,
the protection of children and teenagers, e.g.
violent, pornographic or

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
That runs counter to the public interest or to public
morals;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
That is threatening, insulting, constitutes
harassment, is defamatory or harmful;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.

code or program designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of
any software application, computer or telecommunication tool, this list not
being exhaustive;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
That enables a third party to directly or indirectly
procure pirated software, software applications used to commit acts of piracy
and intrusions into computer and telecommunication systems, and in general any
software or other tool that can be used to infringe the rights of others and
the security of people and property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Users acknowledge and agree that they shall be fully and solely
responsible for the content and the consequences of its aggregation and
dissemination as part of their Collections.
The Users hereby declare that they
hold all the requisite elements (rights, licenses, consents and/or permits) to
enable them to disclose their content.
Conversely, the Users undertake not to
publish any content comprising elements that they are not legally authorised to
hold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Users may be held liable for any content that infringes the rights
of other persons or the applicable laws, including the rules governing the
rights over a person’s image and the intellectual property rights over any
shared content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<b>RESCISSION AND
SUPENSION </b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, for any given reason, Pearltrees considers that a User is not
complying with these T&amp;Cs, including the obligations that are listed above,
Pearltrees may at any point in time, and at its entire discretion, eliminate or
suspend the User’s account and take all requisite legal measures against that
User, bearing in mind that no decision shall be taken without first informing
the School and the User, giving them a reasonable period of notice to remedy
the violation, save in case of gross misconduct by the User.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pearltrees shall be entitled to retain evidence of the violations that
are witnessed by archiving them with a third party service provider for as long
as is necessary to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should Pearltrees be compelled to irrevocably terminate the provision of
the Service, the Users shall be informed beforehand by any means within a
reasonable timescale in order to enable them to organise the transmission and
portability of their data and content towards another medium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users (except the students of the School) may close their accounts from
their profile at any point in time.
All the data linked to their accounts shall
then be eliminated unless the User request the
portability of its data.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<b>LIABILITY</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pearltrees shall be liable to the School and the Users for the proper
performance of the obligations arising from these T&amp;Cs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pearltrees shall not be liable for any failure to perform these T&amp;Cs
that may be blamed on the School, a User, a third party to this contract, or
any event that is beyond its control and that cannot be reasonably foreseen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its capacity as a mere service provider, Pearltrees hereby disclaims
liability for any information, messages and publications disclosed by the Users
in the Account and for the Collections published by the Users, such as on
account of the content aggregated within these Collections.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pearltrees shall do everything in its power to guarantee uninterrupted
access to the Platform and to the Account and continuous provision of the
Service but may not under any circumstance bear liability if, due to any
unavailability linked to maintenance operations or to a failure of the Internet
network or any other reason beyond its control or force majeure, a User cannot
temporarily access the Platform and/or the Account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, although Pearltrees does everything possible to ensure the
security of the information and data stored on its Platform, it cannot
guarantee the lack of any risk of intrusions, data piracy or contamination by
computer viruses pursuant to using the Platform.
It is therefore up to the
Users to take all the necessary precautions for ensuring the security of their
data and the protection of their computer systems against contamination by
viruses or other forms of attacks that may occur upon the use of the Platform.

<p>Should any content that is supposed to be excluded appear in the list of
the results that are proposed to the Users, the User and/or the School may
report that content by sending an e-mail to education@pearltrees.com.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pearltrees undertakes to promptly de-reference any content that is
reported if it would seem that this alert is justified by the nature of the
content.

</b>
<b>&nbsp;Intellectual
property rights over the Platform and the Account</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pearltrees shall retain exclusive ownership of all the elements
comprising the Platform that are protected by Intellectual Property Rights
(including all computer code, design elements, functionalities, photographs,
logos and any content that is made available to the Users directly by
Pearltrees).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any extraction, reproduction, showing, adaptation, modification,
translation, transformation, broadcasting, integration into other elements,
de-compilation, commercial use of all or part of the elements of the Platform
and/or of the Account, as well as of the data and databases that may be
gathered and processed by the Platform and/or the Account, shall be strictly
prohibited.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject to compliance with these T&amp;Cs, Pearltrees also grants the
Users a right to access and to use the Platform and the Account and the

The Users may not use the company names,
trademarks and distinctive signs belonging to Pearltrees save with its prior,
express consent.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>10.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<b>&nbsp;Intellectual
property rights over the content of the Collections </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>Given that Pearltrees does not check the content that
is aggregated and shared in the Collections, the Users shall be fully
responsible for the Collections that are published in the Account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Users hereby undertake to ensure that any third
party content that is aggregated in the Collections that they publish in the
Account shall not infringe the rights of any third parties, such as their
intellectual property rights, and that they shall be entitled to reproduce them
and/or to disseminate them to members of the public over the Internet, unless
this content is royalty-free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Users therefore guarantee Pearltrees against any
challenges, claims of ownership and legal or extrajudicial actions concerning
the abovementioned content and undertake to compensate Pearltrees in full for
any costs and losses that it may incur as a result.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they publish a Collection in the Account, the
Users grant Pearltrees a non-exclusive right to use this Collection free of
charge, enabling Pearltrees to use, to communicate to members of the public, to
reproduce, to adapt, to modify, to transmit and to disseminate this Collection
on any medium, worldwide, for the legal duration of the protection of the
intellectual property rights.

</b>
<b>DATA PROTECTION</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Users are hereby informed that Pearltrees process their personal
data on behalf of the School.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its capacity as data controller, as per the meaning of this term in
the applicable data protection rules and regulations, the School shall also be
liable for the processing of the Users’ personal data.
Pearltrees acts as the
data processor of the School within the meaning of data protection laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The processing of personal data and the management of cookies by
Pearltrees are more extensively described in its privacy
policy.
Pearltrees’ privacy
policy however cannot replace the information that must be provided to the
Users by the School in its capacity of data controller about its own data
protection policy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with France’s data protection law of 6 January 1978, as
subsequently modified, Users have a right to object to, to access, rectify,
port and request the erasure of their personal data, as well as a right to
oppose its processing on legitimate grounds, by contacting the School of the
Account or Pearltrees: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
by sending a letter
by post to Pearltrees, 131 boulevard de Sébastopol,

</b>
<b>THIRD PARTY SITES</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Platform and the Account may comprise hypertext links pointing to
third party sites.
The links pointing to these third party sites do not imply
any approval of these third party sites by Pearltrees.
Pearltrees has no
control over the information, products and/or services proposed by third
parties on the abovementioned sites, and hereby disclaims any liability in this
respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pearltrees moreover hereby disclaims liability for any hypertext links
that the Users may choose to aggregate into the Collections that they publish
in the Account, whether these links are simple or embedded links.
In this
respect, Users must perform the requisite checks in order to ensure that their
hypertext links do not point to Platforms or content that are illegal or that
violate the rights of third parties.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pearltrees finally disclaims liability for any gathering and
transmission of personal data, insertions of cookies or any other process
intended for the same purposes, by these third party sites.

<b>applicable law and settlement of disputes</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These T&amp;Cs are governed by French law.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rules of conflict of laws shall not apply and French law alone shall
apply to the relationship between the Parties, without any reservations, unless
the applicable public interest provisions of the country of residence of a User
require the application of other rules, and these provisions cannot be set
aside by contract.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event of a dispute, the Users may resort to contractual mediation
or any other alternative mode of settlement of disputes.
The User can seize the
consumer ombudsman designated by Pearltrees by accessing the following address:
www.medicys.com.
The European Commission publishes an online settlement of
disputes platform to which the Users may refer, that
is accessible here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should the Parties fail to reach an amicable settlement or a settlement
through mediation, their dispute shall be brought before the courts of Paris,
France, which shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction.
This clause may not however
prevent the Users, acting in their capacity as consumers, from vindicating
their rights before any court that has territorial jurisdiction under the civil
procedure rules that are applicable or before the courts of the place where
they resided at the time of the signature of this contract.</p>
