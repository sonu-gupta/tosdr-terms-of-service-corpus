<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
<p>AppsFlyer provides attribution and marketing analytics services (“<strong>Services</strong>“) that enable advertisers and developers (collectively, “<strong>Customer(s)</strong>“) to: (i) measure and analyze the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by understanding which marketing campaigns contributed to the download/installation of their mobile applications (“<strong>Applications</strong>“) or such other conversion metric (e.g.
relaunch of Application).
and (ii) measure and analyze certain events and actions within their Application or websites, such as in-app purchases made by End Users (as defined below).
The Services also help our Customers identify and protect against fraudulent behavior related to their marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>This Services Privacy Policy describes AppsFlyer’s privacy practices in relation to the information collected from Customers and End Users and received by AppsFlyer when Customers use our Services.
This Services Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through use of AppsFlyer’s publicly accessible website or marketing activities, which is described under our Website Privacy Policy.
To view the Website Privacy Policy, please click here.
Furthermore, AppsFlyer and its Customers have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by AppsFlyer and their use by Customers (“<strong>Agreement(s)</strong>“).
Such Agreements may contain additional obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information.
Nothing in this Services Privacy Policy derogates from such additional obligations.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this Services Privacy Policy: (i) any reference to “<strong>End User(s)</strong>” means end users who have interacted with, or viewed, Customer’s advertising and marketing materials, or use or have used Customer’s Applications, websites, products and services.
and (ii) any reference to <strong>“AppsFlyer”</strong>
<strong>“we”</strong>
<strong>“us”</strong> or <strong>“our”</strong> shall means AppsFlyer Ltd.
and its affiliates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>END USER DATA RECEIVED AND PROCESSED BY APPSFLYER</strong>
<p>When a Customer uses the Services, the following End User information may be received and processed by AppsFlyer (collectively, <strong>“End User Data”</strong>).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>“Technical Information”</strong>: this refers to technical information related to an End User’s mobile device or computer, such as: browser type, device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.</li>
<li>
<strong>“Technical Identifiers”</strong>: this refers to various unique identifiers that generally only identify a computer, device, browser or Application.
For example, IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices).
Google Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique identifiers.</li>
<li>
<strong>“Engagement Information”</strong>: this refers to information relating to the Customer’s ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer’s website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyze within their Application or website (e.g.
add to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).</li>
<li>While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information (“<strong>PII</strong>“), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such.
Within the scope of the engagement between Customers and AppsFlyer, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by AppsFlyer.
However, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII.
This includes, for example, a Customer using an End User’s email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier.
If a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>REGISTRATION INFORMATION RECEIVED AND PROCESSED BY APPSFLYER</strong>
<p>When a Customer registers to use the Services, we may collect certain information related to such Customer (<strong>“Registration Information”</strong> and together with the End User Data, <strong>“Customer Data”</strong>), including Customer name and Customer details, billing information and names and contact details of Customer employees and representatives who are using the Services (e.g.
email, phone number and address).
When a Customer uses the Services, AppsFlyer may also collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Customer is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g.
browser type, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Customer (<strong>“Log Data”</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>HOW DATA IS COLLECTED</strong>
<p>Customer Data may be collected through various methods, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>When provided voluntarily (e.g.
Customer’s Registration Information).</li>
<li>When the Customer integrates AppsFlyer’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Applications, websites and/or ads (<strong>“Collection Technologies”</strong>).
For explanations on cookies and similar technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.</li>
<li>From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Customer in connection with the measurement and analysis of Customer’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with AppsFlyer (<strong>“Partners”</strong>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>HOW DATA IS USED BY APPSFLYER</strong>

<li>to establish: (i) matches between devices used by an End User.
and (ii) to detect fraud (such matched data and fraud data, collectively, the, <strong>“Platform Data”</strong>) in order to ensure more accurate attribution measurement and ad fraud protection for Customers using the Services.
Platform Data does not contain PII such as End User names, physical addresses, phone numbers or other similar personal data that can directly identify an individual.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, we use such information to authenticate login to the Services, to communicate with Customer and to process any payments in connection with the Services.
Additionally, we may use: (i) Registration Information to inform Customer of any updates to the Services, including new features and functionalities.
and (ii) Log Data to understand how Customers are using the Services so that we may efficiently audit, maintain and improve the Services provided to Customers.</li>
<li>AppsFlyer may use information derived from the aggregation of End User Data and/or Log Data with other data for research and analytics purposes and improvement and marketing of the Services (<strong>“Aggregated Data”</strong>).
Aggregated Data shall be anonymous and in no way reveal the identity of the Customer or any End User.</li>
</ol>
