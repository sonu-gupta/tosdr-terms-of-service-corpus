The use of our websites (www.cycl.ch, www.matchpoint.social, www.condense.social, www.firestart.com, www.gennex.ch, www.claimsprovider.net) is generally possible without providing personal data.
Insofar as personal data (e.g.

This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g.
communication by e-mail) can be subject to security gaps.
A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

These data are evaluated exclusively for the improvement of our offer and do not allow any conclusion about your person.</p>
<p>Personal data that indicates the identity of the customer, such as name, address, postal address, delivery address, telephone number or e-mail address, are only collected on our websites if you voluntarily provide them to us when placing an order, registering for an event or webinar, downloading information, license keys or software, creating support tickets or registering for our newsletter or if you use the contact function on the website or otherwise contact us, for example by e-mail.

Google Analytics
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc.
("Google").
Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended by the code "anonymizeIp" in order to guarantee anonymous recording of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).</p>
<p>On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator.
The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google.</p>
<p>You can prevent Google from collecting data relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information on the terms of use and data protection at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html or at https://policies.google.com/?hl=en&amp;gl=us.</p>
<p>If you have agreed that Google may link your web and app browsing history to your Google Account and use information from your Google Account to personalize ads, Google will use your information in conjunction with Google Analytics data to create cross-device remarketing audience lists.
Google Analytics first collects your Google-authenticated ID, which is associated with your Google Account (i.e., personally identifiable information), on our website.
Google Analytics will then temporarily link your ID to your Google Analytics data to optimize our target audiences.</p>
<p>If you do not agree, you can opt-out by selecting the appropriate settings in the "My Account" section of your Google Account.</p>
<p>This website also uses Google Analytics' demographic features feature.
This allows reports to be generated that include statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors.
This information comes from Google's interest-based advertising and third party visitor information.
This information cannot be associated with any specific individual.
You can deactivate this function at any time by the ad settings in your Google Account or generally prohibit Google Analytics from collecting your data as described under "Objection to data collection".</p>

Use of Google AdWords
<p>As an AdWords customer, we also use Google Conversion Tracking, an advertising service provided by Google Inc.
(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
"Google").
Google AdWords places a cookie on your computer/mobile device ("conversion cookie") if you have reached our website via a Google ad.
These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification.
If you visit other Internet sites and then come to our website, we and Google will know that someone clicked on the ad and was directed to our website, should the cookie not have expired.
Each AdWords customer receives a different cookie.
As a result, cookies cannot be tracked through AdWords customer websites.
The information collected from the Conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for Conversion Tracking.
AdWords customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were directed to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag.
However, you will not receive any information that personally identifies users.
If you do not wish to participate in the tracking procedure, you can also refuse to set a cookie as required for this - for example, by setting your browser to generally deactivate the automatic setting of cookies.
You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the https://www.google.com/adwords/ domain.</p>
