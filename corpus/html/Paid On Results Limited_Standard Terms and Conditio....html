Payment.<br> 2.1 Payment Models<br>
<p>Paid On Results will make payments to all affiliates under one of two payment models:-</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<strong>a) Standard Model (Default)</strong>
</p>
<p>Paid On Results undertakes to make payments to affiliates on this payment model 6 weeks after the end of the month in which they have made a sale or action that would result in being paid.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<strong>b) Payment On Request</strong>
</p>
<p>Once an affiliate has been paid by Paid On Results twice, they move on to this payment model provided they have chosen to be paid by BACS and are UK based.
Affiliates on this payment model may request payment at any time for all validated sales made to the date at which you request payment.
Once a request for payment has been made Paid On Results undertakes to process a BACS payment within five days.</p>
<br>
<br> 2.2 GENERAL.<br>
<p>Payment is only made to Affiliates in the UK that have a minimum balance of £25 (twenty-five pounds) in their account or joint accounts.
All Affiliates outside of the UK have to reach a minimum balance of £50 (fifty pounds) in their account or joint accounts before payment is made.
Affiliates who do not meet the minimum balance requirements will not be eligible for payment until it has been reached.
Furthermore any account that has had no activity (clicks, sales etc.) for a period of 6 calendar months will be deemed to be abandoned and Paid On Results will apply a variable account closing charge up to the maximum of £25.
The charge will never be greater than the balance in the account.</p>
<p>Affiliates will receive payment for any action that is payable as set out by each individual Merchant.</p>
<p>Affiliate payments will only be made when funds are in place from the Merchant.
Paid On Results will endeavour to collect funds from the Merchant and then pay the Affiliates on the Merchant's behalf.</p>
<p>In the event of a system problem at the Merchant site that you have not had prior warning about it will be up to the sole discretion of Paid On Results after having discussed the matter with the Merchant as to what compensation if any is to be paid.
No compensation will be made for clicks or sales from the time Paid On Results has made due notice of the problem in it's Affiliate Control Area and/or via Email.</p>
<p>Paid On Results will provide the Affiliate with a detailed real time reporting system showing commission that is pending, approved or void.
The Affiliate agrees to regularly check his reports to ensure that the commission shown is correct.
Paid On Results accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions and their consequential implications which are not notified to us in writing within a 4 week period.
This four week period begins on the day that the sale/action which generates the commission took place.
The exception to this is where the affiliate program operates on a batch reporting system and not in real time.
Where that is the case, the four week period begins when the batch report which includes the day that the sale/action generating the commission took place is uploaded by Paid On Results.
While Paid On Results will do everything we can to correct any errors or omissions which may occur, we will not be liable for any of these which are not brought to our attention within the 4 week period as detailed above.</p>
<p>The majority of Merchant Programs via Paid On Results operate on an 'in funds' basis.
This means that the Merchant provides funds in advance 'up front' to finance Affiliate commission.
In order to allow certain Merchants and Agencies to work with Paid On Results, this may from time to time require working on an 'invoice after action' basis.
Programs that are not 'in funds' will be clearly indicated, and as such, it will be for the Affiliates to decide if the Merchant is worth taking the risk to promote or to continue promote during any period that the Merchant may not be in funds.
Paid On Results is not liable to Affiliates for any loss of income due to Merchants who are not 'in funds' and subsequently don't pay any invoices due.</p>
<p>In the event of any Affiliate fraud, all transactions in the Affiliates account will be reversed.
In addition Paid On Results or the Merchants affected may recover any payments made before fraud has been detected.
We also reserve the right to take legal or criminal action against the companies and individuals involved.</p>
<p>In the event of suspected fraud, payment to an Affiliate's account will be stopped and the Affiliate will be asked to provide additional information as to how they have been promoting the Merchants to ascertain where any rules or program terms may have been broken.
Failure to comply will result in monies being withheld and the Affiliate's account being terminated.</p>
<p>Paid On Results require that all Affiliates supply an invoice before payment will be made.
This must be done online via our control area.
All invoices must include full legal trading details including VAT number where appropriate.
Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create, a partnership or relationship of employer and employee between Paid On Results and the Affiliate.</p>
<p>Any Affiliate outside of the United Kingdom to whom we pay regular or one off large sums of money may be asked to provide information in compliance with Money Laundering Regulations.
Failure to comply will result in monies being withheld.</p>
<p>The Affiliate is responsible for the payment of all tax and national insurance payable on any payments made to him/her by Paid On Results.</p>
