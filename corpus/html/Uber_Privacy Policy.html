<p>

Please see the section of this notice titled “<strong>Choice and transparency</strong>” to learn how to object to this use of personal data.<br>
</li>
<li>Enable <u>Accessibility</u> features that make it easier for users with disabilities to use our services, such as those that enable deaf or hard-of-hearing drivers to alert their riders of their disabilities, allow only text messages from riders, and enable receipt of flashing trip request notifications instead of sound notifications on their mobile device.<br>

This includes:<br>
</p>
<ul>

<li>In certain regions, using information derived from driver’s license photos, and other photos submitted to Uber, for safety and security purposes.

<br>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>6- Marketing.
</strong>Uber may use the data we collect to market our services to our users.
This includes sending users communications about Uber services, features, promotions, sweepstakes, studies, surveys, news, updates, and events.
</p>
<p>We may also send communications to our users about products and services offered by Uber partners.
For example, if a user has placed an Uber Eats order, we may provide recommendations, promotions, or ads about similar food offered by other Uber partners.
Although we may send users communications about Uber partners’ products and services, <strong>we do not sell users’ personal data to, or share it with, such partners or others for purposes of their own direct marketing or advertising, except with users’ consent.</strong>

</p>
<p>We use personal data to make automated decisions relating to use of our services.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling <u>dynamic pricing</u>, in which the price of a ride, or the delivery fee for Uber Eats orders, is determined based on constantly varying factors such as the estimated time and distance, the predicted route, estimated traffic, and the number of riders and drivers using Uber at a given moment.<br>
</li>
<li>Matching available drivers and delivery persons to users requesting services.
Users can be matched based on availability, proximity, and other factors.
Please see <u>here</u> for further information about our matching process.<br>

</li>
<li>Deactivating users who are identified as having engaged in fraud or activities that may otherwise harm Uber, its users, and others.
In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Uber’s referral program, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation.<br>
</li>
<li>Using driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud.
For example, if we determine by using such information that a driver is delaying a rider pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the rider a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver to omit such a fee.
To object to such adjustment, please contact Uber customer support.</li>
</ul>

<strong>7- For legal reasons or in the event of a dispute</strong>
</p>
<p>Uber may share users’ personal data if we believe it’s required by applicable law, regulation, operating license or agreement, legal process or governmental request, or where the disclosure is otherwise appropriate due to safety or similar concerns.
</p>
<p>This includes sharing personal data with law enforcement officials, public health officials, other government authorities, airports (if required by the airport authorities as a condition of operating on airport property), or other third parties as necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, user agreements, or other policies.
to protect Uber’s rights or property or the rights, safety, or property of others.
or in the event of a claim or dispute relating to the use of our services.
If you use another person’s credit card, we may be required by law to share your personal data, including trip or order information, with the owner of that credit card.</p>
<p>Please see <u>Uber’s Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities</u> for more information.</p>
<p>This also includes sharing personal data with others in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company.</p>
<p>
<strong>8- With consent</strong>
</p>
<p>Uber may share a user’s personal data other than as described in this notice if we notify the user and they consent to the sharing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<strong>E.
Data retention and deletion</strong>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Uber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time.
Uber may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for the reasons stated in this policy.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Uber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.
This means that we retain different categories of data for different periods of time depending on the category of user to whom the data relates, the type of data, and the purposes for which we collected the data.
</p>
<p>Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings &gt.
Privacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber’s website (riders and delivery recipients <u>here</u>.
drivers and delivery persons <u>here</u>).</p>
<p>Following an account deletion request, Uber deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute.
Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for a minimum of 7 years after a deletion request.
For riders and delivery recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.</p>
<strong>F.
Grounds for processing</strong>
<p>
<strong>
<em>We only collect and use personal data where we have lawful grounds to do so.
These include processing user personal data to provide requested services and features, for purposes of Uber’s legitimate interests or those of other parties, to fulfill our legal obligations, or based on consent.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect and use personal data only where we have one or more lawful grounds for doing so.
Such grounds may vary depending on where our users are located, but generally include processing personal data: </p>
<p>
<strong>A- To provide requested services and features</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to provide our services, we must collect and use certain personal data.
This includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>User profile data, which we use to establish and maintain user accounts.
verify user identity.
communicate with users about their trips, orders, and accounts.
and enable users to make payments or receive earnings </li>
<li>Background trip information, which is used to verify an applicant’s eligibility to be a driver or delivery person</li>
<li>Driver and delivery person location data, which we use to track trips and assist with navigation</li>
<li>Usage data, which is necessary to maintain, optimize, and enhance Uber’s services, including to determine incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings</li>
<li>Transaction information</li>
<li>Information relating to customer support <br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>B- For purposes of the legitimate interests of Uber or other parties</strong>
</p>
<p>This includes using personal data to maintain and enhance our users’ safety and security.
For example, we use personal data to prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior, such as by retaining data of banned users to prevent their use of Uber’s apps.
We also use usage data to prevent matching of riders and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (for instance, because they have been the subject of prior complaints from other users).
</p>
<p>This also includes purposes such as combating fraud.
improving our services, direct marketing, research, and development.
and enforcing Uber’s Terms of Service.<br>
<br>In addition, it includes using personal data to the extent necessary for the interests of other people or the general public, such as in connection with legal or insurance claims, and to protect the rights and safety of others.</p>
<p>
<strong>C- To fulfill Uber’s legal obligations </strong>
</p>
<p>For example, Uber is subject to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain data about our users’ trips and deliveries, and to provide copies of such data to the government or other authorities.
We collect and use personal data to comply with such laws.
</p>
<p>Uber may also share data with law enforcement regarding criminal acts or threats to public safety, or requests by third parties pursuant to legal processes.
Uber may also share information with public health authorities where required or permitted by law.
For more information about such sharing, please see Uber’s <u>Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - United States</u>, <u>Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - Outside the US</u>, and <u>Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests and Service of Legal Documents</u>.</p>
<p>
<strong>D- With consent </strong>
</p>
<p>Uber may collect and use personal data based on the user’s consent.
For example, we may collect personal data through voluntary surveys.
Responses to such surveys are collected on the basis of consent and will be deleted once no longer necessary for the purposes collected.
<br>
<br>A user who has provided consent to a collection or use of their personal data can revoke it at any time.
However, the user will not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal data.</p>IV.

</p>
<p>Settings menus in the Uber app for riders give them the ability to set or update their location-sharing preferences and their preferences for receiving mobile notifications from Uber.
Information about these settings, how to set or change these settings, and the effect of turning off these settings is described below.
</p>

<strong>Location data</strong>
</li>
</ul>

Location data helps improve our services, including pickups, navigation, and customer support.
</p>
<p>Riders may enable or disallow Uber to collect location data from their mobile devices through the Settings &gt.
Privacy menus in the Uber app.

<p>
<strong>B- Device permissions</strong>
</p>
<p>Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owner’s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained.
iOS devices notify users the first time the Uber app requests permission to access certain types of data and gives users the option to grant or refuse permission.
Android devices notify users of the permissions that the Uber app seeks before their first use of the app, and use of the app constitutes a grant of such permission.</p>
<p>
<strong>C- Ratings look-up</strong>
</p>
<p>After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5.
An average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services.
For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders.
</p>
<p>This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior.
Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders.
</p>
<p>Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the Uber app.
</p>
<p>Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Uber Driver app.</p>
