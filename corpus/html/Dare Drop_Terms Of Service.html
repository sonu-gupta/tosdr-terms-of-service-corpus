Welcome to Dare Drop!<p>This page explains our terms of service.
When you use Dare Drop, you’re agreeing to all the rules on this page.
We’ve done our best to offer you clear and simple explanations of what everything means with brief summaries before each Section.
The summaries are not part of the official legal terms.</p>
<p>Welcome to Dare Drop.
By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by Dare Drop (together with its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors — collectively, “Dare Drop,” “we,” or “us”), and used by companies marketing their products and services (”Brands”), you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “Terms”).
You’re also agreeing to our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Copyright Policy.
and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Rules of Use.</p>
<p>We may change these terms from time to time.
If we do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email.
New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively and we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect.
If you keep using Dare Drop after a change, that means you accept the new terms.</p>
<p>Dare Drop is for your personal, non-commercial use, except as explained in Section 4 and Section 5 below.</p>2.
Creating an Account<p>To use Dare Drop, you need to be 13 years old or older.
If you’re between 13 and 18 (or the legal age of majority for your jurisdiction), you may only use Dare Drop under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms.
You’re responsible for your account and all the activity on it.</p>
<p>You can browse Dare Drop without registering for an account.
But to use some of Dare Drop’s functions, you’ll need to register.
When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete.
Don’t choose names that are offensive or that violate anyone’s rights, and don’t impersonate anyone.
If you don’t follow these rules, we may cancel your account.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential.
If you find out that someone has used your account without your permission, report it to support@DareDrop.com.</p>
<p>To sign up for an account, you need to be at least 18 years old, old enough to form a binding contract where you live, or at least 13 years old under the supervision of a parent or guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Service.
If necessary, we may ask you for proof of your age.</p>3.
Don’t Do These Things<p>This Section is a List of things you know you shouldn’t do: lie, break laws, abuse people, steal data, hack other people’s computers, and so on.
Please behave yourself.</p>
<p>Many people use Dare Drop.
We expect all of them to help keep this a nice place.
Don’t do any of these things on the Site:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Don’t break the law.</strong> Don’t take any action that infringes or violates other people’s rights, violates the law, or breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone</li>
<li>
<strong>Don’t spam.</strong> Don’t distribute unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material, or any junk mail, spam, or chain letters.
Don’t run mail TermLists, TermListservs, or any kind of auto-responder or spam on or through the Site.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don’t lie to people.</strong> Don’t post information you know is false, misleading, or inaccurate.
Don’t do anything deceptive or fraudulent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don’t solicit use of prohibited items of activities.
</strong>Don’t post Dares that include or encourage illegal actions or items, violate any of Dare Drop’s policies, rules, or guidelines, or violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation.</li>
<li>
<strong> Don’t victimize anyone.</strong> Don’t do anything threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, tortious, obscene, profane, or invasive of another person’s privacy.</li>
<li>
<strong> Don’t harm anyone’s computer.
</strong>Don’t distribute software viruses, or anything else (code, films, programs) designed to interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or equipment on the Site (whether it belongs to Dare Drop or another party).</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to make sure that the Site is secure and functions properly.
So don’t do any of these things — most of which boil down to “don’t mess with our system.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t try to interfere with the proper workings of the Services.</li>
<li>Don’t bypass any measures we’ve put in place to secure the Services.</li>
<li>Don’t try to damage or get unauthorized access to any system, data, password, or other information, whether it belongs to Dare Drop or another party.</li>
<li>Don’t take any action that imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure, or on our third-party providers.
(We reserve the right to determine what’s reasonable.)</li>
<li>Don’t use any kind of software or device (whether it’s manual or automated) to “crawl” or “spider” any part of the Site.</li>
<li>Don’t take apart or reverse engineer any aspect of Dare Drop in an effort to access things like source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms.</li>
</ul>4.
How Dares Work<p>Most of our Terms of Service explain your relationship with Dare Drop.
This section is different — it explains the relationship between creators and backers of Dare Drop Dares, and who’s responsible for what.
This is what you’re agreeing to when you create, fund, or deliver results for a Dare Drop Dare.</p>
<p>Dare Drop provides a funding platform for creative Dares.
When a creator fulfills a Dare on Dare Drop or a funder backs a Dare on Dare Drop, they’re inviting other people to form a contract with them.
Anyone who delivers the result for a Dare is accepting the creator’s and funder’s offer, and forming that contract</p>
<p>Dare Drop is not a part of this contract — the contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and backers.
Here are the terms that govern that agreement:</p>
<p>When a Dare is successfully completed, <b>the funders must pay their pledged amounts to the deliverer</b>.
Once a funder has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to the other funders and the deliverer.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, deliverers owe their funders a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the Dare to life.
At the same time, funders must understand that when they fund a Dare, they’re helping to create something.
There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents a deliverer from being able to finish the Dare as requested.</p>
<p>The deliverers are each solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their claimed Dare.
If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by the funders.</p>5.
How Funding Works<p>This section goes over the details of funding and creating Dares.
This is how money gets collected, and the details on how and when pledges can be changed or canceled.</p>
<p>These are the terms that apply when you’re funding or creating a Dare:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re only charged if the Dare is completed.
You’ll provide your payment information when you pledge, but you won’t be charged.
Your payment will only be collected if, at the time of the Dare’s funding deadline, the Dare has been completed.
The exact amount you pledged is the amount Dare Drop will collect.
If the Dare hasn’t been completed, you won’t be charged, and no money will change hands.</li>
<li>In some cases we’ll reserve the charge on your card.
Dare Drop and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full pledge, at any time between the pledge and the collection of funds.</li>
<li>You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time during the Dare, with one exception.
During the last 24 hours before the Dare is completed, you can’t decrease or cancel your pledge without contacting customer support first — if the deliverer has already created the video or is in the process of streaming the video which will be used to deliver on the Dare, then you may not cancel or decrease your pledge.</li>
<li>Dare Drop doesn’t offer refunds.
Responsibility for finishing a Dare lies entirely with the Dare deliverer.
Dare Drop doesn’t hold funds on deliverers’ behalf, cannot guarantee deliverers’ work, and does not offer refunds.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the terms that apply when you’re <b>delivering a Dare</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>We’ll charge our fees before putting funds in your account</b>.
Dare Drop and its payment partners will subtract fees before transmitting the proceeds of a Dare.</li>
<li>
<b>Some pledges can’t be collected, which might reduce the amount of funding you get</b>.
Because some payments can’t be collected — for instance, when a backer’s credit card expires before funding ends, and they don’t provide updated information — we can’t guarantee that the amount of funding you receive will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees.</li>
<li>
<b>We’ll help resolve payment-card disputes</b>.
If a backer of your Dare disputes the charge with their card issuer, we’ll handle re-presenting the charge to settle the dispute with the card issuer.
You’ll be notified that a dispute has been filed, and you’ll be able to provide evidence to help us resolve it in your favor.
If the cardholder’s dispute is found valid, you authorize us to charge the credit card number you provided when you completed the Dare for the amount of the chargeback.</li>
<li>
<b>Don’t count your chickens before they hatch</b>.
Don’t assume you’ll be able to deliver on a Dare when you want.
there could be a reason we’re not able to accept it, or a problem that takes time to resolve.
Don’t assume you’ll be able to immediately collect your funding.
there may be a delay between the end of a successful Dare and your access to the funds.
And don’t take any actions in reliance on collecting any of the money pledged until you actually have the ability to withdraw it from your account and spend it.</li>
</ul>6.

In the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, and without application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act or the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods.
