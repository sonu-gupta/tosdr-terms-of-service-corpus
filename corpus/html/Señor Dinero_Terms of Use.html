<p>THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS BETWEEN You (“You” or “Your”), and Crediterium DE LLC or its subsidiaries

your Transaction Agreements, including but not limited to Your Application, Privacy Policy, Consent

Agreement, Optional Revocable Debit Card Authorization Agreement, Disclosures, Loan Agreement and
Disclosures, and any other Agreements or transactions in connection with your Application and your

<p>Arbitration is a process in which persons with a dispute: (a) waive their rights to file a lawsuit
and proceed in court and to have a jury trial to resolve their disputes.
and (b) agree, instead, to
submit their disputes to a neutral third person (an “arbitrator”) for a decision.
Each party to the
dispute has an opportunity to present evidence to the arbitrator.
Pre-arbitration discovery may be
limited.
The arbitrator will issue a final and binding decision resolving the dispute, which may
then be enforced by a court judgment.
A court rarely overturns an arbitrator’s decision.
It is
acknowledged and agreed that this arbitration is intended to keep both parties' costs down in the
event of a disagreement and is a material inducement to the parties to enter into this Agreement.
THEREFORE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</p>

indirectly to the signing of this Arbitration Agreement, however excluding the validity and scope of
this Arbitration Agreement and any claim or attempt to set aside this Arbitration Agreement.

federal or state law claims, disputes or controversies, arising from or relating directly or
indirectly to Your Loan, the information you gave us before entering into Your Loan, and/or any past
and/or future claims or disputes between you and us.
(c) all counterclaims, crossclaims and third
party claims.
(d) all common law claims, based upon contract, tort, fraud, or other intentional
torts.
(e) all claims based upon a violation of any state or federal law.
(f) all claims asserted by
us against you, including claims for money damages to collect any sum we claim you owe us.
(g) all
claims asserted by you individually against us and/or any of our employees, agents, directors,

collectively referred to as “related third parties”), including claims for money damages and/or
equitable or injunctive relief.
(h) All claims asserted on your behalf by another person.
(i) all
claims asserted by you as a private attorney general, as a representative and member of a class of
persons, or in any other representative capacity, against us and/or related third parties
(hereinafter referred to as “Representative Claims”) .
and/or (j) all claims arising from or
relating directly or indirectly to the disclosure by us or related third parties of any nonpublic
personal information about you.</p>
Waiver
<p>You acknowledge and agree that by entering into this Arbitration Agreement:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY TO RESOLVE
ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A COURT, OTHER THAN SMALL
CLAIMS COURT, RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE
OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
ANY DISPUTE MAY NOT BE
CONSOLIDATED WITH THE DISPUTE OF ANOTHER PERSON.</p>
</li>
</ol>
Class Waiver
<p>Except as provided below, all disputes against us and/or related third parties shall be resolved by
binding arbitration only on an individual basis with you.
THEREFORE, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT
CONDUCT CLASS ARBITRATION.
THAT IS, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE,
AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY FOR OTHERS IN THE
ARBITRATION.</p>
Notice and Choice of Arbitrator
<p>Any party to a dispute, including related third parties, may send the other party written notice by
U.S.
Certified Mail of their intent to arbitrate, along with the subject of the dispute and the
relief requested, even if a lawsuit has been filed.
Regardless of who demands arbitration, you shall
have the right to select any of the following arbitration organizations to administer the
arbitration: the American Arbitration Association (+1 (800) 778-7879)
JAMS (1-800-352-5267).
However, the parties may agree to select a local
arbitrator who is an attorney, retired judge, or arbitrator registered and in good standing with an
arbitration association and arbitrate pursuant to such arbitrator’s rules.
The party receiving
notice of arbitration will respond in writing by U.S.
Certified Mail within twenty (20) days.
If you
demand arbitration, you must inform us in your demand of the arbitration organization you have
selected or whether you desire to select a local arbitrator.
If related third parties or we demand
arbitration, you must notify us within twenty (20) days in writing by U.S.
Certified Mail of your
decision to select an arbitration organization or your desire to select a local arbitrator.
If you
fail to notify us, then we have the right to select an arbitration organization.
The parties to such
dispute will be governed by the rules and procedures of such arbitration organization applicable to
consumer disputes, to the extent those rules and procedures do not contradict the express terms of
your Loan Agreements, including the limitations on the arbitrator herein.
You may obtain a copy of
the rules and procedures by contacting the arbitration organizations listed above.</p>
Arbitration Fees and Hearing
<p>Regardless of who demands arbitration, at your request we will advance your portion of the
arbitration expenses, including the filing, administrative, hearing and arbitrator’s fees
(“Arbitration Fees”).
Throughout the arbitration, each party shall bear his or her own attorneys'
fees and expenses, such as witness and expert witness fees.
The arbitrator shall apply applicable
substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and applicable statutes of
limitation, and shall on or claims of privilege recognized at law.
The arbitration hearing will be
conducted in the county of your residence, or within 30 miles from such county, or in such other
place as mutually agreed by the parties or ordered by the arbitrator.
The arbitrator may decide,
with or without a hearing, any motion that is substantially similar to a motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim or a motion for summary judgment.
In conducting the arbitration proceeding,
the arbitrator shall not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence.
If the
arbitrator renders a decision or an award in your favor resolving the dispute, then you will not be
responsible for reimbursing us for your portion of the Arbitration Fees, and we will reimburse you
for any Arbitration Fees you have previously paid.
If the arbitrator does not render a decision or
an award in your favor resolving the dispute, then the arbitrator shall require you to reimburse us
for the Arbitration Fees we have advanced, not to exceed the amount which would have been assessed
as court costs if the dispute had been resolved by a state court with jurisdiction, less any
Arbitration Fees you have previously paid.
At the timely request of any party, the arbitrator shall
provide a written explanation for the award.
The arbitrator’s award may be filed with any court
having jurisdiction.</p>
Small Claims Court Exception
<p>All parties may ask a small claims court to decide a Dispute that meets the requirements of the
Small Claims Court, so long as no party to the small claims court lawsuit seeks to recover damages
beyond the jurisdiction of the small claims court.
If you file a small claims court lawsuit against
us, then we lose the right to elect arbitration of your Dispute (but not of other persons'
Disputes), however you may not consolidate or join the claims of others.
Any Dispute, which is
outside the jurisdiction of a small claims court, shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
Any
appeal of a judgment from a small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration.</p>
Interstate Commerce
<p>This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall
be governed by the FAA.
If a final, non- appealable judgment of a court having jurisdiction over
this transaction finds, for any reason, that the FAA does not apply to this transaction, then our
agreement to arbitrate shall be governed by the arbitration law of the State of Delaware.</p>
Miscellaneous
<p>This Arbitration Agreement is binding upon and benefits you, your respective heirs, successors and
assigns, and is binding upon and benefits us, our successors and assigns, and related third parties.
This Arbitration Agreement continues in full force and effect, even if your Loan has been paid or
discharged through bankruptcy.

unenforceable, the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be in full force and effect.</p>
