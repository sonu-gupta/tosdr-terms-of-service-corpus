<p>Welcome to Pluto TV.
We take your privacy seriously.
Please read this Cookie and Similar Technology Policy (“<b>Cookie Policy</b>”) to understand how we use cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies on our website at Pluto.tv (including any subdomains, mobile and connected TV versions, the “Sites”), how we share information they provide, and how you can control or manage your consent to the collection of data using these technologies.
</p>
<p>This Cookie Policy is incorporated into our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
Capitalized terms not defined here will have the definitions set forth in these agreements.</p>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies in the following ways and as otherwise communicated to you from time to time (subject to your consent when required by applicable laws).</p>
<b>What are cookies and similar technologies?</b>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that a website places on your browser.
Cookies are used by most websites for security, to learn about and improve upon how users navigate a website, or to enable various features.
For example, cookies can allow the website to save your password, determine whether it is your first visit to the website and how long you stayed on each page, &nbsp;determine if you were brought to the website from another website, and other similar information.
</p>
<p>Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags typically function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email.
The request for these files from a server reveals certain information, such as your browser type, IP address, and other information.
&nbsp;Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons) are electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information such as ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies.
We may also use these automated technologies to collect, analyze, and correlate with other tracking technologies certain information related to the devices you use to access the Services, such as IP addresses, browser type and version, browser language, OS version, unique device identifiers, and other information about your computer(s) and/or mobile device(s), to the extent made available by your device, OS, or your chosen configuration or choices.
In certain cases, these technologies may be used to identify your device or browser through a common process known as “device fingerprinting.”</p>
<p>Other tracking technologies also include locally shared objects (also known as ‘Flash cookies,’) HTML cookies, or other tracking software that stores data on your device on behalf of third parties.
These files may be installed through your browser or other software on your computer that is used by your browser.
These files may be installed by us or a third party.
To control the storage of data through such software, users may be required to change their preferences in the software itself, through a browser, or through the use of specialized add-ons or plugins.</p>
<b>What is the difference between session and persistent cookies?</b>
<p>All cookies have a time limit for which they will be stored.
Cookies are typically classified as “session cookies” or “persistent cookies” depending on how long they will be stored.
Session cookies remain on your browser while you are logged on to a particular website and typically ‘expire’ or are deleted from your device when or shortly after you leave the website, close the browser, or when you delete them.
Persistent cookies remain on your device for longer periods of time, sometimes indefinitely, or until you delete them.
</p>
<b>How can these technologies affect my privacy?</b>
<p>Information from cookies and similar technologies may be used to collect information about your activities over time and across sites.
For example, information can be aggregated and used to determine patterns of behavior on the website, or simply to store your preferences.
Sometimes however, cookies and similar technologies can be used to link information about browsing, viewing, or other uses to a single device, browser, or user, although this information is not typically correlated to information that readily identifies you.
To learn more about how cookies and other tracking and analytics technologies are generally used and how they can affect your privacy, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
<b>What cookies/technologies do you use and how do you use/share them?</b>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies for several important reasons.
First, we use cookies for “essential” or “functional” purposes, meaning they enable various features of the Services.
Certain other “analytics” or “performance” cookies and similar technologies track how the Services are used or perform, and how users engage with the Services.
“Advertising” and “tracking” cookies and similar technologies are used in the process of selecting and delivering advertisements to you, and help us to continue offering our Services free of charge.</p>
<p>Please note, the specific cookies and technologies we use are subject to change without notice.
We may use third-party analytics providers who use tools, such as Google Analytics, to enhance analytics on our Sites.
See your browser’s settings menu for a list of the cookies currently in use on our Services.
You may contact us using the information below if you have questions about any specific cookie or other technology.</p>
<p>We generally use the following types of cookies and similar technologies on our Services:</p>
<i>Essential and functional cookies/technologies</i>
<p>Our Services typically use certain cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies that enable various operations on the webpage.
For example, our browser-based Services request the installation of essential cookies to maintain an active session, or keep you logged in to your account.
Our browser-based Services may similarly request the installation of a cookie for various functions, for example, if you would like your browser to remember your username or password, or stay logged in after a session has ended.
Our use of essential technologies may occur regardless whether you have provided your consent.
Our functional technologies may be used without your consent, or you may consent implicitly through your use of a particular feature or browser configuration.
Please note, if your browser does not accept cookies, these features may not work properly or your experience may suffer.
</p>
<i>Analytics cookies/technologies</i>
<p>Our Services use cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies to understand how users navigate our Services and the content they view.
For example, when you first arrive to our Sites, our Sitesmay install several session cookies that track how long you stay on each page.
Our Services may also install persistent cookies that help us keep track of the number of returning visitors and to understand how users reach our Services.
</p>
<p>These cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies are generally used in order to improve the performance of our Services and to learn how users interact with the features of our Services or other services.
These cookies or technologies may be provided or controlled by us or our trusted third-party service providers.
For example, we currently work with analytics providers who provide tools that analyze usage of our Services.
While some of these cookies may use unique identifiers, the data is analyzed only in the aggregate and we do not use these technologies to identify you personally.
</p>
<i>Advertising and targeting-related cookies/technologies</i>
<p>Our Services also use cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies to understand, tailor, and deliver content and advertisements through our Service.
For example, we may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content.
</p>
<p>This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Services and on third-party websites that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network.
We may also share information about your use of our Services with our advertising and analytics partners.
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
We and third-party vendors, for example Google and AdRoll, use third-party technologies together to report how your ad impressions, uses of advertising services, and your interactions with these ad impressions and/or ad services are related to visits to our Services.
See our Privacy Policy for additional details.</p>
<p>The information these parties collect includes information about your visits to our Sites and Services, as well as other sites and services you may use.
We or these third parties may augment the information collected with information provided by third parties.
We and the parties that operate these services may build a profile of you containing this information, create or link your information to a profile or unique ID, and may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
These third-party tracking technologies allow us and these providers to better inform, optimize and deliver advertisements that are personalized to your preferences and individual profile.
.
</p>
<p>These technologies may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you purchase a good or service you were shown in an advertisement.
In some cases, these technologies may be used to develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person to which a company wants to advertise, whether and how ads you see are effective, and may also be used to augment your profile with information derived from these observations.</p>
<b>What are my choices regarding these technologies?</b>
<p>You can control cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies or withdraw your consent to information collection in several ways.
First, many browsers allow you to change the settings such that the browser will either allow or block the installation of cookies.
You may delete all cookies stored by your browser using your browser’s privacy menu.
Third parties may also offer you a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for certain purposes.
