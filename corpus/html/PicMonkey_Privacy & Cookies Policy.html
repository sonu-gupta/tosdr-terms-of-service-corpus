To ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection and is treated securely, we have put the appropriate safeguards in place to protect the privacy and integrity of such personal information when being transferred outside the EEA in the form of EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses.

Your name and profile image associated with your Collaborations Feature content will be retained in line with our Data Retention Period.&nbsp.
