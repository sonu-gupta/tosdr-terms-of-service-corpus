<p>The personal information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), including the United States, for the purposes described above.
To ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection and is treated securely, we have put the appropriate safeguards in place to protect the privacy and integrity of such personal information when being transferred outside the EEA in the form of EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses.
