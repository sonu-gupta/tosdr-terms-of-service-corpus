</ul> Sur.ly Terms of Service <p>Thank you for using Sur.ly.
By accessing the Sur.ly website (“Site”) or using the services offered by Sur.ly (“Services”) you agree and acknowledge to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”).
If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access the Site or use the Services.

Sur.ly reserves the right to terminate your license to use the Site and Services at any time and for any reason or start charging for commercial usage in future.</p> 2.
User responsibility <p>You are solely responsible for your use of the Site and Services.

The linked websites' content, business practices and privacy policies are not under our control, and we are not responsible for the content of any linked website or any link contained in a linked website.

No warranty and limitation of liability <p>Sur.ly provides the site and services “as is” and without any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory.
Sur.ly specifically disclaims any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, information accuracy, integration, interoperability or quiet enjoyment.
Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.
You understand and agree that you use the Site and Services at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages that arise from such use.
under no circumstances shall Sur.ly be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages of any kind, or any other damages whatsoever (however arising, including by negligence), including without limitation, damages related to use, misuse, reliance on, inability to use and interruption, suspension, or termination of the site or services, damages incurred through any links provided on the site and the nonperformance thereof and damages resulting from loss of use, sales, data, goodwill or profits, whether or not sur.ly has been advised of such possibility.
your only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with this site or services or with sur.ly shall be to terminate use of this site and services.
Some states do not allow the exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you.</p> 5.
Other <p>Sur.ly and you are independent entities, and nothing in the Terms, or via use of the Site or Services, will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between Sur.ly and you.
These Terms supersede any previous agreement and represent the entire agreement between Sur.ly and you.
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York without reference to conflict of laws principles.
If any provision of the Terms is adjudged to be illegal or unenforceable, the continuation in full force of the remainder of the Terms will not be prejudiced, and the illegal or unenforceable provision of the Terms shall be severed accordingly.
