Legal Disputes and Arbitration Agreement <b>Short version:</b>
<i>You and we agree to resolve disputes on an individual basis via arbitration, with limited exceptions, unless you opt out as described below.</i>
<b>1.
Initial Dispute Resolution</b>
<br> We are available by email at support@pastebin.com to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Website or Service.
Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
<br>
<br>
<b>2.
Terms of Service and Binding Arbitration Agreement</b>
<br> If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the “Initial Dispute Resolution” paragraph above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.
All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Website or Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS on a non-confidential basis in accordance with the provisions of its then-effective rules, including its streamlined procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service or the Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of the Agreement or these Terms of Service is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The procedures and rules of the Federal Arbitration Act shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision and the parties hereby reject, waive and disclaim the application of any state Arbitration Act, with all other issues determined under the internal laws of the State of Nevada applicable to contracts made and performed in that state wihtout regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
<br>
<br> The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/, or by calling JAMS at 1.800.352.5267.
To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost.
A request for payment of fees should be submitted to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and Pastebin will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.
If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000.
The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases.
<br>
<br> The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
<br>
<br>
<b>3.
Class Action Waiver</b>
<br> The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
<br>
<br>
<b>4.
Exception – Small Claims Court Claims </b>
<br> Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>
<b>5.
Exception – Intellection Property, Confidenitiality and Privacy Protection</b>
<br> Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in court per Section N.7 below to enjoin infringement or misuse of intellectual property, confidential information, or User Personal Information.
<br>
<br>
<b>6.
30 Day Right to Opt Out </b>
<br> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the preceding three paragraphs by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: support@pastebin.com.
The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of creating an account to use the Website or Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes as set forth herein.
<br> If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
<br>
<br>
<b>7.
Exclusive Venue for Litigation </b>
<br> Solely to the extent the arbitration provisions set forth above do not apply, or for purposes of either party enforcing an award granted to it pursuant to arbitration, the parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Las Vegas, Nevada (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside).
The parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Las Vegas, Nevada for any litigation other than small claims court actions.
The parties irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction in Las Vegas , Nevada for any litigation and hereby waive, for all purposes, their right to challenge the lack of personal jurisdiction of Las Vegas , Nevada over any litigation arising in connection with, out of, or as a result of (a) these Terms of Service, the Agreement, the Website or the Service, and (b) any acts or omissions of Pastebin, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees or agents in connection with these Terms of Service, the Agreement, the Website or the Service, or any action to enjoin infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights, confidential informaiton or User Personal Information.
