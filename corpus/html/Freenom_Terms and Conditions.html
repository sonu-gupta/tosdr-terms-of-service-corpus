<p>Privacy Policy</p> Free Domains <p>This is the standard way of registration.
It's a free service! You need to have a website, homepage or web page online on an existing web address or the capability of setting up your own website/server with content.
Every Internet user who surfs to your free domain address will automatically go to the website address you have registered.
You can change your website address any time to redirect your users to a different website or web page.</p>
<p>Registration Agreement FREE Domains</p>
<p>Next to the terms and conditions of free domain names, free domain name registrations are subject to content policies set out by the top level domain name registries.

This means that you can register the domain for a longer period of time (1-10 years) and where you identify yourselves in the WHOIS record of the domain.
Legal license holders (paid domain name registrants) are able to sell or transfer their domains - just like it is common with any top level domain.</p>
