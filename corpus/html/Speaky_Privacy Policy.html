<p>
<b>General Information </b>
</p>
<p>Speaky offers users online language and spelling course services (hereafter referred to as the <b>“Services”</b>), accessible from the website www.speaky.com / (hereafter referred to as the <b>“Site”</b>) or via a learning platform installed on the user's device (hereafter referred to as the <b>“Platform”</b>).
In this context, Speaky is committed to respecting the privacy of users.
Speaky therefore makes every effort to protect the confidentiality of the Data collected and to respect both national legislation related to the collection and processing of Data as well as European Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (hereafter referred to as: <b>“GDPR”</b>).
This policy regarding the use of personal data (hereafter referred to as the <b>“Privacy Policy”</b>) details Speaky’s practices with regard to the collection of personal information (hereafter referred to as <b>“Data”</b>) following consultation of the Site, placing orders, requesting information, and executing the Services from the Site or Platform or via any other electronic means of communication.
By “use of personal data”, we mean any handling of data that can identify you as a natural person.
On the other hand, the data collected by Speaky in the context of a study on language knowledge (specifically with a view to refining the tests offered to Users) are anonymised and are solely intended for the production of anonymous global statistics.
This data is not subject to any individual processing and is therefore not subject to the Privacy Policy.
The data that we collect is specifically defined in the “Data Collection” section, which we invite you to read carefully.
Speaky is committed to respecting your privacy and providing you with as much information as possible to allow you to control what happens to your Data.  You will therefore find below further information about the Data we collect, why we collect it, how long we keep it, your privacy rights and how you can exercise them.

<p>Speaky uses your Data only to the extent necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained.

<b>For what purposes and on what legal basis do we use your Data? </b>
</p>
<p>Speaky uses your Data for various purposes.
in this context, each time we only use the data that is essential to achieve the intended purpose.
We use the Data when it is necessary: </p>
<ul>
<li>In the context of the preparation of a contract, its execution or its dissolution (<b>Article 6.1.b.  GDPR</b>).
For example, to provide you with the requested Services, respond to questions you have about the Services, ask you for your opinion about the Services and optimise your searches when you are on our Site.
</li>
<li>To conform with the legal and regulatory provisions to which Speaky is subject (<b>Article 6.1.c GDPR</b>).
</li>
<li>On the basis of our legitimate interests, ensuring in such cases to balance these with respect for your privacy, in particular if you are a minor (see the section “Handling of Data Related to Children”) (<b>Article 6.1.f. GDPR</b>).

Specifically, this allows us to: </li>
</ul>
<p>- Send you our Newsletter </p>
<p>- Offer you new products, services, or special campaigns that are likely to be of interest to you (by mail, telephone, email or via social networks) </p>
<p>-  Send you promotional offers </p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, Speaky may collect and use data with your consent if it is to send you promotional messages, provided that you are not yet listed as an Interested Party.
In this context, you may at any time request to unsubscribe to these promotional messages.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>To whom can we transmit your Data? </b>
</p>
<p>We only transmit your Data to third parties when: </p>
<p>-  It is necessary for the proper execution of our services </p>
<p>-  It is necessary to meet a legal obligation </p>
<p>-  You give us the authorisation </p>
<p>In order to execute our Services, we may subcontract, in whole or in part, some of our tasks to technical subcontractors, for example to an IT company with a view to hosting the Site and storing the Data and backup copies.
We ensure that subcontractors handle your data in the same manner we do.
that is, in a safe, respectful and responsible way.
and we provide adequate contractual guarantees to this effect.
Speaky therefore requires its subcontractors to comply with data protection legislation and to provide sufficient guarantees regarding the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, so that the use of the data meets the requirements of applicable data protection legislation and guarantees the protection of your rights.
</p>
<p>
<b>Your Rights </b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Right of Access </li>
<p> You have the right to consult your Data at any time, free of charge.</p>
<li>Right to Rectification </li>
<p> You have the right to demand that incorrect Data be corrected and that inappropriate Data or Data that is no longer needed be deleted.</p>
<li>Right to Erasure </li>
<p> When you no longer want your Data to be used and request that it be deleted, we will proceed to delete your Data from our database.</p>
<p>It is necessary to take into account that it is not always possible to delete all personal data requested, for example when its processing is essential for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal rights, or because it is required by the judicial authorities to retain such Data.
You will receive further information concerning this subject, should it be necessary, in the response to your request.</p>
<li>Right to Data Portability </li>
<p> To the extent necessary, you will also be entitled to the portability of your Data under the conditions provided by applicable data protection legislation.
We draw your attention to the fact that data portability is only possible for Data that you yourself have provided to Speaky on the basis of an authorisation or a contract.
This right of portability is therefore only applied to Client and Student Data.</p>
<li>Right to Object to the Processing of your Data </li>
<p>What happens when you do not wish or no longer wish to receive any form of commercial communication? You maintain the right to object, without having to provide a justification, to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.

<li>Right to Limit Use </li>
<p>Finally, you maintain the right to limit the use of your Data by Speaky, in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.
</p>
<li>Exercising your Rights </li>

</p>
</ul>
<p>
<b>For how long do we keep your data?  </b>
</p>
<p>We are unable to retain your Data beyond the time necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it is collected.

</p>
<p>
<b>Security </b>
</p>
<p>We have developed adapted technical and organisational security rules, in order to prevent the destruction, loss, falsification, modification, unauthorised access, and accidental disclosure to third parties and any other unauthorised handling of Data.
For example, Speaky synchronises databases containing User or Customer Data securely on three different physical supports in different locations.
In order to protect the entire system against viruses and security breaches, system software and application software packages are updated as soon as a security update is available.
A firewall is installed on each server and configured by our network administrator to protect against any external attack.
Access to the servers is also restricted by private-public key, with the private key being encrypted (DES 256).
Finally, the individual computer of each Speaky employee is equipped with an automatically updated and professional antivirus.
In addition, developers or employees working on the infrastructure are equipped with a computer that has a fully encrypted hard disk.
In the event of a data leak with adverse consequences for your Data, you are personally notified under the circumstances and within the time limits as stipulated by law.
To ensure the security of your Data, we advise that you: </p>
<p>-  Do not disclose your password to third parties </p>
<p>-  Change your password regularly </p>
<p>- Make sure that access to your computer/tablet/smartphone is secure </p>
<p>You are solely responsible for your client account and the consequences of its use, as well as for any information of any kind that you communicate to Speaky.
Speaky is not liable in the event of damage caused because of erroneous, incomplete or fraudulent information that you provide to us.
</p>
<p>
<b>Telecommunications Privacy Guarantee </b>
</p>
<p>All transmissions of personal data will be encrypted via “https” pages.
 This mainly concerns all the administrator tools (server management, database access, server access).
 All communication between servers is encrypted using TLS technology, and access to the server is via encrypted SSH and VPN connections. This guarantees a high level of data security and confidentiality.  In addition, all user and supervisor passwords are encrypted (SHA256) in our database and cannot be read externally or internally by SPEAKY.
It is for this reason that we only send new passwords and never an existing password.
This is a very important security measure that prevents inappropriate access to strictly personal and confidential data.  </p>
<p>
<b>Links to Third Party Sites </b>
</p>
<p> We would like to point out that our website may contain links to third party sites, and some of our services may grant you access to third party services (such as social networks).
We have no control over how third party sites and services handle your Data.
We do not review third party sites and services, and we are not responsible for those third party sites and services or their practices regarding the protection of your Data.
We invite you to carefully read the data handling policies of third party sites that you access from our site.
</p>
<p>
<b>Handling of Data Related to Children </b>
</p>
<p>We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 16 without the explicit authorisation of a parent or guardian.
In the event that information about children under the age of 16 has been inadvertently collected by us, we will take steps to delete the Data as soon as possible, unless we are required by law to store that information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Changes to the Privacy Policy </b>
