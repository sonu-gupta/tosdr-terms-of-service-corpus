<u>Tracking Technologies</u>.
We use cookies to track user activity on our websites and online services, but we do not collect personal information about your online activities over time as you move across other websites and online services.
Web browsers can transmit Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals that indicate that a user does not wish to have activity tracked.
Currently, no universally accepted standard exists for how to interpret such signals, and we do not respond to Do Not Track signals.
Thus, whether or not you have turned on your DNT setting should not affect your experience or interaction with our websites or online services.

</ul>
<strong>Children’s Privacy</strong>
<p>Digital privacy is a component of BSA’s commitment to youth protection and safety.
As such, we do not collect the personal information of children under the age of 13 unless a child’s parent or legal guardian provides it to us through the online membership registration process or a child provides it to us to enter a contest or promotion.
In any event, consistent with the U.S.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a parent may review or have deleted their child’s personal information, and prohibit its further collection or use.
If you have a request in relation to the personal information of your child below the age of 13, please send an email to privacy@scouting.org.</p>
<p>For contests and promotions, we typically require only the information necessary for a child to enter, such as first name (to distinguish among family members) and his or her online contact information.
We will only use the child’s online contact information to enter him or her into the contest or promotion and contact him or her once when the contest ends.
If a contest or sweepstakes asks the child to submit his or her own created content with the entry and that content contains the child’s personal information, then we will either pre-screen the submission to remove any personal information or seek parental consent by email for the collection.
To facilitate delivery of the contest’s prize, we may ask a child at the time of entry to also provide her or her parent or legal guardian’s online contact information, which we will only use to notify the parent or legal guardian if the child wins the contest or promotion.</p>
<p>Our sites and applications that are age-gated are not intended for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 through those sites and applications.
In the unlikely event we discover that we have collected personal information from a child other than as described in this section, we will either delete the information immediately or promptly seek the parent or legal guardian’s consent to use the information.</p>
<strong>Data Security, Integrity and Retention</strong>
<p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us.
We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect guest information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification.
From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods.
Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<strong>Changes</strong>
<p>From time to time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes.
We will provide notice to you if these changes are material, either by direct notice or posting an announcement on the websites where this policy is posted, and, if required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent.</p>
<strong>Comments and Questions</strong>
<p>If you have a comment or question about this policy or our treatment of your information, you may email us at privacy@scouting.org, write to us at Boy Scouts of America, Attn: Privacy Compliance-Legal Department, 1325 West Walnut Hill Lane, Irving, Texas 75038, or contact our Member Care Center at (972) 580-2000.

<u>General Data Protection Regulation</u>:</p>
<p>Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires those who collect personal information from individuals in the European Union to provide certain information to such individuals at the time their personal information is collected.
In GDPR parlance, those who collect and direct the use of such personal information are referred to as “data controllers” or simply “controllers”, and such individuals are referred to as “data subjects”.
The terms “processing”, “profiling”, and “recipient” are defined in Article 4 of the GDPR, as is the term “personal data”, which is analogous to the term “personal information” used in this policy.
Much of the information required by Article 13 is set forth elsewhere in this policy.
For ease of reference, below we have indexed the contents of this policy to the specific requirements of Article 13 and included additional commentary as appropriate:</p>

<p>“How We Use Information” describes why we collect, store and use personal information, and “Sharing Your Information with Others” describes why we disclose personal information to third parties.
We process personal information because it is necessary to either (a) perform a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract, (b) protect against threats to health and provide medical treatment, (c) serve our legitimate interests in the safe and proper administration of our programs, activities, events, and advancements, or (d) comply with legal requirements.
With respect to the personal data of employees of the BSA Transatlantic Council based in Brussels, Belgium, at U.S.
Army Garrison Benelux, we process such personal information for internal administrative purposes.</p>

<p>The period for which the personal data will be stored</p>
<p>“Data Security, Integrity and Retention” describes how long we store personal information</p>
<p>The existence of certain rights of the data subject</p>
<p>Pursuant to GDPR, data subjects (i.e., individuals in the European Union) have the right to (a) request access to their personal information.
(b) rectify or correct inaccurate personal information.
(c) have their personal information erased in certain circumstances.
(d) restrict the processing of their personal information in certain circumstances.
(e) object to the processing of their personal information in certain circumstances, such as processing for direct marketing purposes.
and (f) the right to receive, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, the personal information he or she has provided to us under certain circumstances and the right to transmit such data to another controller.</p>
<p>The right to complain to a supervisory authority</p>
<p>Pursuant to GDPR, data subjects (i.e., individuals in the European Union) have the right to lodge a complaint with one of the independent public authorities established by the countries in the European Union (each such public authority is referred to as a “supervisory authority” in GDPR parlance).</p>
<p>Whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data;</p>
<p>“Your Controls and Choices” describes your options for providing personal information to us and the potential consequences of your choices.
The provision of personal data by you, the data subject, is your choice and not a statutory requirement, unless indicated otherwise at the point of collection.</p>
<p>The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling</p>
<p>We use automated processes, such as data analytics, to analyze your personal preferences, interests, and location with respect to our programs, products and services, and we use such analyses to deliver to you offers, promotions and other information we believe you would find interesting or useful.</p>
