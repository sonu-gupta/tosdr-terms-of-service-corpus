<br> Welcome to TinyURL!™ <p>Are you sick of posting URLs in emails only to have it break when sent causing the recipient to have to cut and paste it back together? Then you've come to the right place.
By entering in a URL in the text field below, we will create a tiny URL that <i>
<b>will not break in email postings</b>
</i> and <i>
<b>never expires</b>
</i>.
</p>
<b>Enter a long URL to make tiny:</b>
<br> Custom alias (optional):<br> https://tinyurl.com/ <br>
<small>May contain letters, numbers, and dashes.</small> An example <p>Turn this URL: </p> http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Globally/dp/B003FSUDM4/ref=amb_link_353259562_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-10&amp;pf_rd_r=11EYKTN682A79T370AM3&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_p=1270985982&amp;pf_rd_i=B002Y27P3M into this TinyURL: http://tinyurl.com/KindleWireless Which one would you rather cut and paste into your browser? That's the power of TinyURL! <p>
</p> Add TinyURL to your browser's toolbar <p>Click and drag the following link to your <i>links</i> toolbar.
</p> TinyURL! Once this is on your toolbar, you'll be able to make a TinyURL at the click of a button.
By clicking on the toolbar button, a TinyURL will be created for the page you are currently at.
<p>
</p>
<p>This is compatible with most web browsers and platforms as long as your bookmarks or favorites allow javascript.
The links toolbar may not be visible in all setups and in most browsers, you can enable it in the View-&gt;Toolbars menu of your web browser.
You can also put it in your bookmarks instead of the links toolbar.</p> Redirection to any page in your site! <p>With TinyURL, you can also make a smaller URL that will work for any page on your site.
Let's say that you have a website with the homepage that is at: </p>http://www.my-internet-isp.com/~myusername Entering that URL into TinyURL will create a URL like http://tinyurl.com/3 With this you can then redirect someone to anywhere within your site by appending a slash and the pages filename to it.
So if you have a page at http://www.my-internet-isp.com/~myusername/my-links-page.html, you can use the URL http://tinyurl.com/3/my-links-page.html and going to this URL will forward the visitor to the page in your website.<p>
</p> Link to us! Please link to us! Just make a link to https://tinyurl.com or use the following code to make a URL input box: &lt;form action="https://tinyurl.com/create.php" method="post" target="_blank"&gt.
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#E7E7F7"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt.
&lt;b&gt;Enter a long URL to make &lt;a href="https://tinyurl.com"&gt;tiny&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt.
&lt;input type="text" name="url" size="30"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="Make TinyURL!"&gt.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt.
&lt;/form&gt.
