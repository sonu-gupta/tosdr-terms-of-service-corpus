Parties shall, in this case, consult each other for the purpose of agreeing to new provisions to replace the null and void or voided provisions.</li>
<li>Without prejudice to the provisions of article 1.4, the provisions of these Terms prevail if a conflict should arise about any of the arrangements made by parties, unless parties have explicitly departed from these Terms in writing, with reference to these Terms.
In the event of a conflict between the provisions of different sections of these Terms, the provisions of a prior section apply, unless parties have explicitly agreed otherwise.</li>
<li>AskAnna may make amendments to these Terms of Use.
In case of an amendment, AskAnna will give client at least 30 days notice thereof.
An amendment will be considered to be accepted by client and will enter into force on the date determined by AskAnna, if client does not reject the amendment within 30 days following the notification thereof.
