        Appcast’s Privacy Policy<p>Revised and Effective – June 30, 2021</p>
<p>Appcast, Inc.
(“Appcast” or “we” or “us”) is a job advertising technology service.
We also own and operate several websites (e.g., www.appcast.io).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes (i) the types of information we collect when you use our websites (the “websites”), interact with our products, services, or applications (the “Service”) in any manner.
(ii) how we use the information we collect.
(iii) with whom and why we share it.
and (iv) the choices we offer regarding our use of the information.
We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how to contact us about our privacy practices.</p>What Information Do We Collect?<p>We gather various types of information, including information that identifies or may identify you as an individual (“personal information”) as explained in more detail below.</p>
<strong>Information You Provide Us</strong>
<p>We receive and store personal information you submit directly to us.
For example, when you register as a user of the Service, you submit basic personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, and physical address, and we collect and maintain your user ID and password, which you create and provide to us.
When you fill out a hosted job application or submit your interest in certain job vacancies using a version of the Service where we host that submission process, we collect the personal information that you submit as part of that form in order to process that application, including your name, email address, physical address, and phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also ask for your responses to employment-related questions, such as whether you know how to use certain software products, are available to work at night or have sufficient work-related permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also enable you to upload a copy of your resume or CV.
We do not control what information is included in your resume or CV, but we encourage you to refrain from including sensitive personal information such as your Social Security Number, identification numbers, or financial account information.&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may collect additional information related to your job application and prospective employment.</p>
<p>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<strong>Information&nbsp;Collected Through Technology</strong>
<strong>Through the Service</strong>
<p>To provide the Service, we collect certain information from job applicants using automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, when they click on an Appcast-sponsored job ad at third party websites, and when job applicants start and complete a job application at your website or a website operated by your applicant tracking system, and when certain points of the recruitment process (for example an interview or hire) have been completed.
The information we collect in this manner may include IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, referring URLs, dates and times of site visits, and predictive demographic information that does not identify you individually.
We anonymize IP addresses by hashing or truncating them.&nbsp.
A cookie is a text file that websites send to a user’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the device and browser or to store information or settings in a browser.
A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag or pixel tag, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
ID syncing is a methodology for securely and privately making associations between two or more web servers about certain actions for attribution and ad optimization purposes.
We may also enable third parties to use cookies, web beacons, and ID syncing to collect information when you click on an Appcast-powered job ad at third party websites, when job applicants start and complete a job application for a job vacancy, and when certain points of the recruitment process (for example an interview or hire) have been completed.</p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but browser settings can be changed to prevent these cookies from collecting information.
Disabling cookies does not necessarily disable the use of pixel tags, web beacons and other technologies that collect information.</p>
<p>Unless you include it in your resume or CV, we do not collect the following information, and we urge you to exclude this information from your resume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Security Number, Driver’s License Number, or other personally identifying numbers</li>
<li>Payment card information or other financial information.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Through the Websites</strong>
<p>Our websites collect certain information related to your device automatically.
This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, the general location where the device is located, browser information, date and time of application or click.</p>
<strong>Information from Third Parties</strong>
<p>We may receive information about you from various third parties, such as lead generation companies, recruiters, job search websites, resumé databases, and public data sources.</p>
<strong>Children</strong>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16.
If you are under 16, please do not register for Appcast’s Service or send any personal information about yourself to us.
If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as soon as possible.
If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at contact@appcast.io.</p>
<strong>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</strong>

<strong>Transferring Personal Data to The United States</strong>
<p>Appcast is located in the United States.
Please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to, processed, or accessed in the United States and other countries in which our service providers are located, and may be subject to United States law or other international law.
The privacy and data protection laws in the United States and other countries may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence.</p>
<p>The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” under Article 45 of the GDPR.
&nbsp;Appcast relies on i) derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR or ii) Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers of Personal Data.
In particular, Appcast collects and transfers outside the EEA and UK personal data only: with your consent, to perform a contract with you, or to fulfill a legitimate interest of Appcast in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.
Appcast endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with Appcast and the practices described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
We acknowledge our liability for such data transfers to third parties.</p>
<p>We will always give you an opportunity to choose opt out before your personal data is (1) disclosed to a third party (other than an agent doing work at our direction), or (2) to be used for a purpose that is materially different than that for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
The only exception to this choice would be where we are required to disclose your personal data pursuant to government or judicial order, law, or regulation to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
