<p>To better understand your purchasing preferences, we may also use third party vendors that provide tracking tools that recognize and collect usage and interest information across the sites you’ve visited from your various Devices.
When you visit the Services on a specific Device, a unique ID is created for that Device which may be based on your hashed (de-identified) email address.
This allows us and our third party vendors to deliver relevant product recommendations, personalized content and advertising to you based on your interests gathered across multiple sites.
This data may be combined with the same information from another browser or Device if you use multiple browsers or Devices.
Third party tracking tools might also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your mobile Device, the websites you visit and other information about you or your Device in order to analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Services and elsewhere.</p> INTERNET ADVERTISING <p>We or our advertising partners may use Tracking Technologies to collect Information about your visits over time and across the Services and other third-party websites, and combine that information with other information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you.
For example, we use Google interest based cookies to serve personalized ads to you.
Our ad partners automatically receive your IP address or Device identifier when this happens.
Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.
These third parties may also use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest based advertisements from other advertisers to you on third-party websites and applications.</p>
<p>The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) has also made available for consumers tools on which you can register your choices not to be tracked by participating advertising networks or companies in the collection and use of your online activities.
These are (1) The DAA Consumer Choice Page for Mobile Web and (2) DAA AppChoices, which is a mobile app that allows you to opt out of the collection and use of cross-app data, other than for permitted uses, by listed third-party AppChoices participants.
You may opt out of mobile-app targeted advertising ads from any or all of the listed participating advertising networks.
You can download the free mobile app from an app store available on your mobile platform.
When you opt out with a particular participating advertising network, the mobile app adds your device identifier to that participant’s opt-out list.
The participant advertising network is then notified to block the device identifiers on the opt-out list.
You can also prevent your receipt of interest-based ads on websites by deleting and declining cookies in your browser(s).
Note that your opt-out choice is applied only to the browser from which you make the choice.</p>
<p>Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications, or your mobile web browser may provide a “Do Not Track” browser setting which will notify those ad servers and networks who recognize the signals to refrain from sending you interest based ads to your mobile device.
You can check the settings on your device for such options in your device’s operating system.
