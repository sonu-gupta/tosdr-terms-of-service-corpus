Services (or, if we offer a free trial, at the end of your free trial), or
purchase a gift subscription for another (each, a “<b>Transaction</b>”), you
expressly authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge you for

We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to

your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and
notification, or we may use the App Store’s (defined below) or another payment
processor’s payment functionality (any such information, “<b>Payment
Information</b>”).
You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to
use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information.
For each
Transaction, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third
parties so we can complete your Transaction and to charge your payment method
for the type of Transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and
other charges).
You may need to provide additional information to verify your
identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included
within the definition of Payment Information).

Subscription, you will be charged the recurring Subscription fee, plus any
applicable taxes, and other charges (“<b>Subscription Fee</b>”), at the
beginning of your Subscription and at the end of each period thereafter, such
period determined by your choice of Subscription (e.g., monthly, every six
months, or annually), at the Subscription Fee we then charge you for the
Services.

processor) will automatically charge you at the end of your existing
Subscription period, using the Payment Information you have provided, until you
cancel your Subscription.
If you elect an annual Subscription, Audm will send
you a reminder at least fourteen (14) days prior to each renewal with the
then-current Subscription Fee.
By agreeing to these Terms and electing to
purchase a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring
payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations
prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Audm.

FINAL AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CANCEL THE PURCHASE AND/OR RECEIVE A REFUND FROM
YOUR TRANSACTION AT ANY TIME.
But if something unexpected happens in the course
of completing a Transaction, we reserve the right to cancel your Transaction
for any reason.
if we cancel your Transaction we’ll
refund any payment you have already remitted to us for such Transaction.
Without
limiting the foregoing, you may cancel your Subscription at any time, but
please note that such cancellation will be effective at the end of the
then-current Subscription period.
To cancel, you can cancel using the App Store
or the App’s functionality or send an email to support@audm.com.
You will be responsible for all Subscription

(defined below) that you and Audm are not required to arbitrate will be the
state and federal courts located in Brooklyn, New York, and you and Audm each

<b>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<b>Dispute Resolution.</b>
<b>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</u> We
each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to
these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity
thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “<b>Disputes</b>”)
will be resolved <b>solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a
class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding</b>.
You and Audm
agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Audm are each waiving the right to
a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision
shall survive termination of these Terms.
<b>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<u>Exceptions and Opt-out</u>.
As limited
exceptions to Section 16(a)
above: (i)&nbsp;you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it
qualifies.
and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other
equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or
misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
In addition, <b>you</b>
<b>will
retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute </b>if
you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so<b>
</b>by email at support@audm.com or by
regular mail at<i>
</i>495A Henry Street
#1034, Brooklyn, NY 11231 within thirty (30) days following the date you first
agree to these Terms.
<b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration
Rules</u>.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<b>AAA
Rules</b>”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
The AAA Rules
are available at www.adr.org
or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must
submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other
party as specified in the AAA Rules.
The AAA provides a form Demand for
Arbitration at www.adr.org.
If your claim is for U.S.
$10,000 or
less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or
video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA
Rules.
If your claim exceeds U.S.
$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Any
arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live,
unless we both agree to a different location.
The parties agree that the
arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation,
applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
<b>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<u>Arbitration Costs</u>.
Payment of all
filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
We’ll
pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your
Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute
frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all
of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration
you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent
provided under applicable law.
<b>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<u>Class Action Waiver</u>.
<b>YOU AND AUDM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved
through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims
with your claims, and
may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
proceeding.
If this specific provision
is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution
section shall be null and void.
<b>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<u>Effect of Changes on Arbitration.</u> Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 3 “Changes to Terms or
Services” above, if Audm changes any of the terms of this Section 16 “Dispute Resolution”
after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent
changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written
notice (including by email to support@audm.com)
within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the
“Last Updated” date above or in the date of Audm’s email to you notifying you
of such change.
By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will
arbitrate any Dispute between you and Audm in accordance with the terms of this
Section 16 “Dispute Resolution”
as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent
changes to these Terms).
<b>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</b>
<u>Severability.</u>&nbsp.
With the
exception of any of the provisions in Section 16(e)
of these Terms ("Class Action Waiver"), if an arbitrator or court of
competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or
unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.
