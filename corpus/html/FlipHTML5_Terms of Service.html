If you or we cancel your subscription, you are not entitled to a refund of any subscription fees that were already charged for a subscription period that has already begun.
You agree to submit any dispute regarding any charge to your account in writing to FlipHTML5 within thirty (30) days of the charge, otherwise that dispute will be waived and the charge will be final and not subject to challenge.
Refunds (if any) made pursuant to a dispute, are at the discretion of FlipHTML5.</p>
