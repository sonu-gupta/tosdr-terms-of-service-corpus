<strong>COVID-19 Screening Tool And Thermal Vision Camera<br>
</strong>In order to help reduce the risk of COVID-19 infections and keep our communities safe, all Dell employees, contingent workers, and visitors must complete a daily health survey and pass a thermal body temperature screening in order to gain access to Dell premises.
The thermal vision camera measures your body temperature on an anonymous basis and Dell does not retain your body temperature.
If your body temperature is equal to or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be denied entry and/or asked to leave Dell premises.
<br>
<br>The health survey screening tool, available via an app or web portal, collects your name, email address, and certain health data you voluntarily provide.
This information will be retained on your device and not shared with Dell unless you self-report that you are COVID-19 positive.
In that case, the tool will notify Dell Environment, Health, and Safety (“EHS”) team, and your email address will be retained for up to 30 days (subject to local laws) so EHS may contact you as it takes appropriate action to protect the health and safety of individuals at Dell physical locations.
Your COVID-19 positive status will be shared with the Dell EHS team and applicable public health authorities (as required by law).
Your status will also be shared on an anonymous basis with potentially infected individuals for contact tracing purposes.<br>Your Consumer Privacy RightsYou may have the following consumer privacy rights under applicable state laws, including California privacy laws:<br>
