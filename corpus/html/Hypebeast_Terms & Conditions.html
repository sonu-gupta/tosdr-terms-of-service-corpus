Copyright¶ <p>You agree not to copy, distribute, display, disseminate, or otherwise reproduce any of the information on our website, or our website itself, including text, graphics, illustrations, logos, button icons, images, audio, video and music, and the selection and layout of such content, without our prior written permission.

Trademarks¶ <p>"HBX" is a trademark used by us, Hypebeast Hong Kong Limited, to uniquely identify our website, business, and service.
You agree not to use any of our trademarks, service marks, designs, and logos anywhere without our prior written consent.
Additionally, you agree not to use our trade dress, or copy the look and feel of our website or its design, without our prior written consent.
You agree that this paragraph goes beyond the governing law on intellectual property law, and includes prohibitions on any competition that violates the provisions of this paragraph.</p> 12.
Communications Decency Act <p>As we are located in Hong Kong, we have certain defenses available to us for liability for defamation posted on our website by third parties, such as in our forums or on our blog.
We recommend that you review the decision of the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Court of First Instance in the case of Oriental Press Group Ltd.
and Another v.
Fevaworks Solutions Ltd.
Specifically, the law in Hong Kong is that we are a "subordinate distributor" and not automatically liable for the defamatory material of another who posts on our website.</p>
<p>Our Online Community Policy (described above) prohibits defamation from being published on our website.
In order to complain about defamatory material on our website, please notify us with full details of where the defamation is located on our website (provide us with the URL), your name, and an explanation of how the material is defamatory.
We will respond within a reasonable timeframe and, if it appears that there are grounds to believe the material is defamatory, we will remove it.
You may send your request to info@hypebeast.com.</p>
<p>
<u>Special Note to American Users</u>
</p>
<p>Please note that if you are thinking of suing us in the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act prohibits you from holding us liable for the comments of a third party.
Additionally, the SPEECH Act prohibits you from enforcing in the United States any judgments obtained against us in a Hong Kong court for a third party’s defamatory statements, and if you attempted to sue us in a Hong Kong court for the actions of a third party our lawyers would make a motion in the U.S.
courts where your deposition is to be taken to prevent such a deposition from occurring.
Therefore, we stress the importance of following the proper Hong Kong notification procedure as described above.</p> 13.
