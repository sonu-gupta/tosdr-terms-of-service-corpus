INTRODUCTION
<p>
Boeing Employees' Credit Union (“BECU” or “we”) is a not-for-profit credit union.
We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our online visitors and members.
We recognize that individuals need to understand how their privacy is protected, so we have established the following privacy notice (“Privacy Notice”) for our users.</p>
<p>
This Privacy Notice explains what personal information BECU will collect about you from our BECU websites and BECU mobile applications, both as defined below (collectively, the “online services”) as well as from third-party and offline sources.
This Privacy Notice also explains how we use, protect, and disclose information to provide you with the online services and other financial services (collectively, the “financial services”).</p>

<p>
<strong>
What does personal information mean?</strong> “Personal information” means personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, telephone number, and account numbers.
It does not include aggregated data that does not reveal your identity or anything about you individually.

Remember, aggregated data is not considered personal information.</p>
