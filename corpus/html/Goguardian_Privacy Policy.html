<strong>Data Controller vs.
Processor.
Our Legal Bases for Using Your Information</strong>
<p>Under applicable law, GoGuardian is considered the "data controller" of information from or about our Website visitors.
In other words, GoGuardian is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, share, and disclose this information.</p>
<p>The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union ("<strong>EU</strong>") require companies to tell you about about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing your information.
To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Contractual Commitments:</em>

<strong>
<em>Legitimate Interests:</em>
</strong> In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Website, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Legal Compliance:</em>
</strong> We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How Long We Keep Information</strong>
<p>We generally retain information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above.
To dispose of any personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps.
Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional time period of time.</p>
<strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong>
<p>GoGuardian takes the security and privacy of your data very seriously.
For these reasons, GoGuardian has implemented various technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information.
These safeguards vary depending on the sensitivity of the information at issue.</p>
<p>GoGuardian is committed to preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data, and will investigate any possible occurrence.
In the event of a breach of personal data, GoGuardian will comply with all relevant breach laws.</p>

At this time, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will consider all of your requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law.
