</ul> Compare Anything ›› <i>vs.</i> Diffen:Privacy policy Summary <p>If you only read the Diffen website, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general.
</p>
<p>If you contribute to Diffen, you are <b>publishing</b> every word you post publicly.
If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever.
This includes articles, user pages and talk pages.
Some limited exceptions are described below.
</p> Publishing on Diffen and public data <p>Simply visiting the web site does not expose your identity publicly (but see private logging below).
</p>
<p>When you edit any page on Diffen, <b>you are publishing a document</b>.
This is a public act, and you are identified publicly with that edit as its author.
</p>
<p>
<b>Identification of an author</b>
</p>
<p>When you publish or edit a page on Diffen, you may be logged in or not.
</p>
<p>If you are logged in, you will be identified by your user name.
This may be your real name if you so choose, or you may choose to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name you selected when you created your account.
</p>
<p>If you have not logged in, you will be identified by your network IP address.
This is a series of four numbers which identifies the Internet address from which you are contacting Diffen.
Depending on your connection, this number may be traceable only to a large Internet service provider, or specifically to your school, place of business, or home.
It may be possible that the origin of this IP address could be used in conjunction with any interests you express implicitly or explicitly by editing articles to identify you even by private individuals.
</p>
<p>It may be either difficult or easy for a motivated individual to connect your network IP address with your real-life identity.
Therefore if you are very concerned about privacy, you may wish to log in and publish under a pseudonym.
</p>
<p>Your IP address is also associated and published with any "anonymous" comments that you post on Diffen.
</p>
<p>When using a pseudonym, your IP address will not be available to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a Diffen page by you or by another user with the same IP address.
In all cases, your IP address will be stored on the Diffen servers and can be seen by Diffen's server administrators and by users who have been granted "CheckUser" access.
Your IP address, and its connection to any usernames that share it may be released under certain circumstances (see below).
</p>
<p>If you use a company mail server from home or telecommute and use a DSL or cable Internet connection, it is likely to be very easy for your employer to identify your IP address and find all of your IP based Diffen contributions.
Using a user name is a better way of preserving your privacy in this situation.
However, remember to log out or disconnect yourself after each session using a pseudonym on a shared computer, to avoid allowing others to use your identity.
</p>
<p>

You may clear these cookies after use if you are using a public machine and don't wish to expose your username to future users of the machine.
(If so, clear the browser cache as well.)

<b>Passwords</b>
</p>
<p>Many aspects of the Diffen's community interactions depend on the reputation and respect that is built up through a history of valued contributions.
User passwords are the only guarantee of the integrity of a user's edit history.

</p> Private logging <p>Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server.
Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using.
</p>
<p>The raw log data is not made public.
</p>
<p>Log data may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site.
IP addresses of users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of Diffen, including the suspected use of malicious "sockpuppets" (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users, or disruption of Diffen.
</p>
<p>
<b>Policy on release of data derived from page logs</b>
</p>
<p>It is the policy of Diffen that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database via the CheckUser feature, may be released by the system administrators or users with CheckUser access, in the following situations:
</p>
<ol>
<li> In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement
</li>
<li> With permission of the affected user
</li>
<li> When necessary for investigation of abuse complaints.
</li>
<li> Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues.
</li>
<li> Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers
</li>
<li> Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Diffen.com, its users or the public.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Diffen's policy does not permit public distribution of such information under any circumstances, except as described above.
