<p>We’ve included annotations in the gray boxes below to emphasize certain portions of our terms and help guide you as you read them.
The annotations aren’t summaries, so please take the time to read everything!</p>
<p>This page describes the general terms that apply to your use of any of our services.
By using our services you agree to these terms on top of any other terms that apply to a specific service you are using (like Team Management, for example).
If you use our services on behalf of your company, your company agrees to them too.</p>
<p>These General Terms of Service (“General Terms”) are a legal agreement between you, as a current or prospective customer of Square’s services (“you,” “your”) and Square, Inc.
Square Capital, LLC, and/or Square Financial Services, Inc., (”Square,” “we,” “our” or “us”) and govern your use of Square’s services, including mobile applications, websites, software, cloud-based solutions, hardware, and other products and services (collectively, the “Services”).
By using any of the Services, you agree to these General Terms and any policies referenced within (“Policies”), including our Privacy Notice (see Section 8) and terms that limit our liability (see Section 18) and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see Section 21), which are collectively incorporated herein by reference.
You also agree to any additional terms specific to Services you use (“Additional Terms”), such as those listed below, which become part of your agreement with us (collectively, the “Terms”).
If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you represent to us that you have authority to bind that business or entity to these Terms, and that business accepts these Terms.
You should read all of our Terms carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>Payment Terms: These terms apply to all Payment Services.</li>
<li>Point of Sale Additional Terms of Service: These terms apply when you use certain Square Point of Sale Services.</li>
<li>ACH Service Terms: These terms apply when you use ACH Services.</li>
<li>HIPAA Business Associate Agreement: If you are subject to HIPAA as a Covered Entity or Business Associate (as defined in HIPAA) and use the Services in a manner that causes us to create, receive, maintain, or transmit Protected Health Information on your behalf, then you agree to the HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (“HIPAA BAA”).</li>
</ul> 1.
Square Account Registration <p>Provide accurate personal information during registration and keep the information current.
We can suspend or terminate your account if you provide incomplete or false information.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all activity on your account.</p>
<p>You must open an account with us (a “Square Account”) to use the Services.
During registration we will ask you for information, which may include but is not limited to, your name and other personal information.
You must provide accurate and complete information in response to our questions, and you must keep that information current.
You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your Square Account, including for any actions taken by persons to whom you have granted access to the Square Account.
We reserve the right to change the account type, suspend or terminate the Square Account of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or who fails to comply with the account registration requirements.</p> 2.
Revisions, Disclosures and Notices <p>We can make updates to our terms of service at any time, and we’ll notify you of these updates as appropriate.
By continuing to use our services after these updates, you agree to the revised terms.</p>
<p>You also agree to receive notices from us electronically.</p>
<p>We may amend the Terms at any time with notice that we deem to be reasonable under the circumstances, by posting the revised version on our website or communicating it to you through the Services (each a “Revised Version”).
The Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted, but will not apply retroactively.
Your continued use of the Services after the posting of a Revised Version constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version.</p>
<p>You agree to Square’s E-Sign Consent.
We may provide disclosures and notices required by law and other information about your Square Account to you electronically, by posting it on our website, pushing notifications through the Services, or by emailing it to the email address listed in your Square Account or that you otherwise provided to Square.
Electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies.
Such disclosures and notices are considered received by you within twenty-four (24) hours of the time posted to our website, or within twenty-four (24) hours of the time emailed to you unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered.
If you wish to withdraw your consent to receiving electronic communications, contact Square Support.
If we are not able to support your request, you may need to terminate your Square Account.</p> 3.
Restrictions <p>If you want to use our services, you can’t do certain bad things.
If we think you are doing these bad things, we have the right to share your information with law enforcement.</p>
<p>You may not, nor may you permit any third party, directly or indirectly, to:</p>

Compatible Mobile Devices and Third Party Carriers <p>We do not warrant that the Services will be compatible with your mobile device or carrier.
Your use of the Services may be subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer or your carrier.
You may not use a modified device to use the Services if the modification is contrary to the manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including disabling hardware or software controls—sometimes referred to as “jail broken.”</p> 5.
Your Content <p>You retain all rights to your content when you upload it into our services, but you do give us broad rights to use, modify, display your content in our services.
You can see specifics on the rights you grant us below.</p>
<p>Also, anything you provide us or make available to the public through our services must not contain anything that we think is objectionable (e.g., illegal, obscene, hateful or harmful to you, our customers or us).
We can remove any content at any time.</p>
<p>The Services may include functionality for uploading or providing suggestions, recommendations, feedback, stories, photos, documents, logos, products, loyalty programs, promotions, advertisements and other materials or information (“Content”).</p>
<p>You grant us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual, and sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display your Content throughout the world in any media for any reason, including to provide, promote, and/or incorporate into the Services.
You retain all rights in your Content, subject to the rights you granted to us in these General Terms.
You may modify or remove your Content via your Square Account or by terminating your Square Account, but your Content may persist in historical, archived or cached copies and versions thereof available on or through the Services.</p>
<p>You will not upload or provide Content or otherwise post, transmit, distribute, or disseminate through the Services any material that: (a) is false, misleading, unlawful, obscene, indecent, lewd, pornographic, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, abusive, or inflammatory.
(b) encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or gives rise to civil liability.
(c) breaches or infringes any duty toward or rights of any person or entity, including rights of publicity, privacy or Intellectual Property Rights.
(d) contains corrupted data or any other harmful, disruptive, or destructive files.
(e) advertises products or services competitive with Square’s or its partners’ products and services, as determined by us in our sole discretion.
or (f) in our sole judgment, is objectionable, restricts or inhibits any person or entity from using or enjoying any portion of the Services, or which may expose Square, its affiliates or its customers or other persons to harm or liability of any nature.</p>
<p>Although we have no obligation to monitor any Content, we have absolute discretion to remove Content at any time and for any reason without notice.
Square may also monitor such Content to detect and prevent fraudulent activity or violations of Square’s General Terms.
You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Content, including any loss or damage to any of your Content.</p> 6.
Copyright and Trademark Infringement <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask you to do the same.
We have adopted an Intellectual Property Policy regarding third-party claims that your material infringes the rights of others.
We respond to all valid notices of such infringement, and our policy is to suspend or terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.</p> 7.
Security <p>We take security incredibly seriously, but can’t guarantee that bad actors will not gain access to your personal information.
You need to do your part by keeping your passwords safe, being smart about who has access to your account and which of your devices can access our services, and letting us know if you think an unauthorized person is using your account.</p>
<p>If there is ever a dispute about who owns your account, we are the decider.</p>
<p>We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental destruction, loss, alteration and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure.
However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
You provide your personal information at your own risk.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access to the Services from your compatible mobile devices and computer(s).
You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or Square Account or any other breach of security.
You will immediately take all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of a security breach and will cooperate with Square and provide all information requested by Square to remediate the breach.
Any assistance provided by Square in relation to a security breach does not in any way operate as acceptance or acknowledgement that Square is in any way responsible or liable to you or any other party in connection with such breach.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Sections 20 and 21, in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, we will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion.
Our decision (which may include termination or suspension of any Square Account subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties.</p> 8.

In such circumstances, you agree that you will comply with the data protection laws applicable to you and will provide data subjects with information on the processing of their personal information which satisfies the transparency requirements of such data protection laws and which ensures that personal data may be processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner.
If you or your business are located in California, please see Section 27.</p> 9.
Communications <p>You consent to us sending messages to your email or mobile devices about your account or our services, which may include marketing.
You can opt out of communications in ways that are specific to that communication method, such as by unsubscribing from emails, or replying to text messages with ‘STOP’.</p>
<p>You consent to accept and receive communications from us, including e-mail, text messages, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number you provide to us when you sign-up for a Square account or update the contact information associated with your account.
Such communications may include, but are not limited to requests for secondary authentication, receipts, reminders, notifications regarding updates to your account or account support, and marketing or promotional communications.

You may opt out of any promotional phone calls by informing the caller that you would not like to receive future promotional calls.
You may only opt-out of text messages from Square by replying STOP.
You acknowledge that opting out of receiving communications may impact your use of the Services.</p>
<p>We also provide Services that allow you to send short message service (SMS) messages to your customers (the “Seller-Initiated SMS Services”).
You will only use the Seller-Initiated SMS Services in compliance with these Terms and all other applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdiction from which you send messages and in which your messages are received.</p> 10.
Paid Services <p>Lots of what we offer is free, but we offer paid services too.
We can collect payments for a paid service by either charging your linked debit/credit card or taking the payment from your transaction proceeds, Square-account balance or linked bank account.</p>
<p>We’ll give you 30 days advance notice if we change our subscription fees, and you can cancel your subscription at any time.</p>
<p>Square’s Services include both paid-for Services (“Paid Services”) and free Services, for which no fees are charged (“Free Services”).
Square offers certain Paid Services to be paid for on a recurring basis (“Subscription Services”) and others on an as-used basis (collectively, “Paid Services Fees”).
Subscription Services may subject you to recurring fees and/or terms.
By signing up for a Subscription Service, including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription fee and any applicable taxes (“Subscription Fee”).
See Payment Terms for terms applicable to Payment Services.</p>
<p>Paid Service Fees may be paid by debit card, credit card, or deducted from your transaction proceeds.
however, Paid Service Fees related to hardware may only be paid by debit card or credit card.
If you link a debit or credit card to your account, you authorize us to collect Paid Service Fees by debit from your linked debit card or charge to your linked credit card.
Regardless of payment device, we reserve the right to collect Paid Service Fees by deduction from your transaction proceeds, the Balance (as defined in the Payment Terms) in your Square Account or your linked bank account.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise provided in a Subscription Service’s terms, Subscription Fees will be charged on the first of every month until cancelled.
You may cancel a Subscription Service at any time from your Square Account settings.
If you cancel a Subscription Service, you will continue to have access to that Subscription Service through the end of your then current billing period, but you will not be entitled to a refund or credit for any Subscription Fee already due or paid.
We reserve the right to change our Subscription Fee upon thirty (30) days’ advance notice.
Your continued use of Subscription Services after notice of a change to our Subscription Fee will constitute your agreement to such changes.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all applicable taxes that arise from or as a result of your use of Square’s Services.
For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by you to Square under the Terms shall be paid free and clear of any deductions or withholdings whatsoever.
Other than taxes that may be charged by Square to you and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities on your behalf, any deductions or withholdings that are required by law shall be borne by you and paid separately to the relevant taxation authority.</p> 11.

Binding Individual Arbitration <p>This section provides details about how we will resolve disputes through the arbitration process.</p>
<p>
<strong>General.</strong>
You and Square agree that any and all Disputes, except those that are resolved informally or brought in a small claims court, will be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can.
ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST SQUARE.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).</p>
<p>
<strong>Pre-Filing Requirement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes.</strong> Before an arbitration is commenced, you or Square agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a Dispute informally.
Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms.
To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice (“Notice”).
Any Notice to Square should be sent by mail to Square, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142.
Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account.
The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number.
(ii) provide detailed information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming party’s individualized claim and for the other party to determine if an amicable resolution is possible.
and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages.
Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent.
After that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration.
Each party agrees that state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California, referenced below, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.</p>
<p>
<strong>Scope of Arbitration.</strong> If we are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this Section and the Commercial Arbitration Rules for that forum, except you and Square will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and to request that the AAA’s Expedited Procedures apply regardless of the claim amount.
Except as set forth above, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the General Terms and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Small Claims Court.</strong>
Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis.
If a party has already submitted an arbitration demand to the AAA, the other party may, in its sole discretion, inform the AAA that it chooses to have the Dispute heard in small claims court.
At that time, the AAA will close the arbitration and the Dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court, with no fees due from the arbitration respondent.</p>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
§§ 1-16, including its procedural provisions, fully applies.
Any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or videoconference.
The Arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Square values your privacy, particularly with respect to your financial transactions and data.
Each of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other result of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law.
While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s claim.
