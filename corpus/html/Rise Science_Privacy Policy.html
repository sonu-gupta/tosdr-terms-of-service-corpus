<p>
<strong>Welcome to RISE.
The power behind your next best day.</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RISE makes it easy to improve your sleep and daily energy to reach your potential.</p>
<p>Maintaining the privacy of your information is of paramount importance to us as it helps foster confidence, goodwill and stronger relationships with our users.
This Global Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) describes the privacy practices of Rise Science, Inc.
(“<strong>RISE</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) when you use or otherwise interact with our website at https://www.risescience.com/ (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and our mobile application RISE Sleep (the “<strong>App</strong>”).
The App allows users to track their sleep, sleep debt, and energy levels, along with offering guided support and educational content on a wide array of relevant topics.
The Site and the App are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the “<strong>Service.</strong>” Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements.
In this Privacy Policy, we also provide a supplementary privacy notice for California residents and a supplementary privacy notice for data subjects in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK (collectively, “<strong>Europe</strong>”) and Brazil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and forms part of our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before using the Service or submitting any personal information to RISE, please review this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us at privacy@risescience.com if you have any questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‍</p>
<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT</strong>
<p>Here’s a description of the categories of information we may collect when you interact with our Service, and examples of how we use the specific types of information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>‍</p>
<strong>Information You Provide Us</strong>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Account data, </strong>such as your email address and password (required to create an account on our Service) and other information you may choose to provide, such as your first name, last name, phone number, and gender.
If you create an account or log into the App using third-party services, such as Google or Facebook, we will receive information about you as permitted by your profile settings on the third-party service in order to authenticate you.
The information we receive when you authenticate through a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service.
You should always check the privacy settings and notices in the relevant third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Information uploaded by you on the App</strong>, such as your estimated sleep duration, sleep and energy quality surveys.</li>
<li>
<strong>Communications</strong> that we exchange with users when they contact us and use our support services.
We also collect your information when you wish to set an e-meeting with us, to share with us your ideas about new features you would like to see on RISE or when providing us with your feedback.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Payment and transactional data </strong>if you choose to sign up for a premium account with additional features and content, including name, payment card information, bank account number, billing information, and your transaction history.
This information is collected by Apple (and if applicable, Google) with respect to in-app purchases made through the App.
If you make a purchase for the App through our Site, our payment processor, Stripe, Inc., will collect and process your payment information.
In addition to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, information related to your payments or purchases is also processed according to Stripe’s services agreement and privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<strong>Information We Receive From Your Use of the Service</strong>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<ul>

<strong>Steps, movement and phone motion data</strong>, collected through your device’s accelerometer or phone motion (if you choose to authorize this from your phone settings).
This data is needed to make predictions for when and how long you have slept.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Sleep and step data</strong>, if you are using certain devices and authorize the App to access this data from your phone settings.&nbsp.
Each morning, RISE checks Apple Health or Google Fit for the previous night’s sleep data.
If your third-party sleep tracker device or application (such as the Apple Watch sleep app) has sent data to Apple Health or Google Fit, RISE will use it to make predictions for when and how long you have slept.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, (a) we use Apple Health and / or Google Fit sleep and step data only to provide the Service and not for advertising, and (b) we will not disclose this data for advertising, marketing, or use-based data mining not needed to provide the Service.</li>
