Our search engine Spot is a metasearch engine.
It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.
All your requests are anonymized.
There is no systematic mining of the data sent to you other than to provide you with search results.
There is no manual processing or transfer to any third party.
IP addresses are logged for the minimum legal duration.
We can not take any responsibility for third-party apps and the data they store or obtain about users.
We do have a policy in our app store against abusing private data and any app that is found to be in violation is removed and its author banned.
However, we do not have the ability to check all code of all third-party applications and thus we recommend you are careful when installing third-party apps.
If you see any problems, please report it to abuse@e.mail&nbsp;Location<p>In /e/OS, we don’t collect or keep any information about your GPS location.
To be able to locate you when you use the onboard maps application or other services requiring your location, we do so by leveraging the Mozilla Location Services API, a set of software tools developed by Mozilla Corporation.</p>
<p>Here is what that means for your data</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that Mozilla receives your approximate location when you ask us to locate you.
Mozilla will receive your location each time you choose to share your location with another application or website.</li>
<li>Mozilla receives publicly observable data about WiFi access points, Bluetooth beacons and cell towers around you, your estimated latitude and longitude, the date and information about your heading, speed and altitude.
This information is stored locally on your device until an Internet connection is established.
The data is then deleted from your device and sent to Mozilla.</li>
<li>If you do not want to report crowd-sourced data to Mozilla, you can set your location services to ‘off’ or ‘device only’.
These settings can be accessed from your OS, going into ‘Settings’, then tap ‘Location’.
To turn off location services, tap the switch in the top right corner and then&nbsp.
‘Mode’.
To select ‘device only, within the ‘location’ settings page, tap on ‘mode’ and select ‘Device only.</li>
<li>In addition, Mozilla may receive certain temporary data such as your IP address.
This data is deleted after being used as follows:</li>
<li>for security purposes to protect against certain types of attack.</li>
<li>to assist in providing you with an approximate location.</li>
</ul>Over the Air Updates<p>When you connect to our servers to update /e/OS, we collect some visitors statistics such as your IP address, only for our internal use.
We use these statistics internally, for example, to know which country users come from or which smartphones variants are being updated.
These statistics are not providing us any personal identifiable information.
This information is not disclosed unless legally obliged to do so.
All data on your “own” /e/ server is encrypted and never shared, sold or traded to any third party.&nbsp;We will only disclose the limited user data we possess unless legally obliged to do so.
