AWOs that participate in the Wagtopia microchip program are provided with access to Wagtopia software at no cost.

<p>

&nbsp.
The Wagtopia Marketplace.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.1 &nbsp.
&nbsp;Description of Services.</strong> The Wagtopia Marketplace provides a venue for users to purchase certain pet products, goods, services and any other pet-related items (“Products”) as may be listed by Sellers.&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>1.2 &nbsp.
&nbsp;Content, Pricing and Accuracy.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;All features, content, availability, specifications, products and prices of Products described or depicted on the Wagtopia Marketplace are subject to change at any time without notice.
The inclusion of any Products on the Wagtopia Marketplace at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these Products will be available at any time.
Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only.
We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of the Products and ensure that information on the Wagtopia Marketplace is complete, accurate and up-to-date.
Despite our efforts, the information on the Wagtopia Marketplace may occasionally be inaccurate, mispriced, incomplete or out-of-date.
We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on the Wagtopia Marketplace.
For example, Products included on the Wagtopia Marketplace may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may carry a different price than what is stated on the Wagtopia Marketplace.
We reserve the right to correct any errors from time to time and we will not be obliged to supply the Products at the incorrect price, or in accordance with the incorrect description.
In the event of a pricing error or discrepancy on the Wagtopia Marketplace with respect to Products, we reserve the right to cancel any orders (or partial orders) for such Products.
We will (at our discretion) either cancel your order and refund the price you have paid or use reasonable efforts to contact you and ask you whether you wish to continue with the order at the correct price or correct description.
The inclusion of any Products on the Wagtopia Marketplace at a particular time does not imply or warrant that such Products will be available at any other time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>1.3</strong>&nbsp.
&nbsp;<strong>Shipping.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Product order is placed, it will be shipped to the address designated by you, as long as such shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Wagtopia Marketplace.
Multiple items placed with separate vendors may incur multiple shipping costs per individual Seller.&nbsp;&nbsp;REMINDER, a complete and accurate address is critical for successful delivery.
An incomplete or inaccurate address will cause significant delays and loss of shipments.
Unfortunately we’re not able to accept liability for lost Products if you input an incorrect or incomplete address, and you will not be refunded in this event.
Any recovery, re-stocking, re-shipments, or other costs related to your entry of incorrect or incomplete addresses will be at your expense.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.4 &nbsp.
&nbsp;Confirmation, Seller Cancellation and Coupons.&nbsp;</strong>While it is our practice to confirm online orders via email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order nor our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product.
We reserve the right, without prior notice and at any time: (a) to limit the order quantity on any Product and/or to refuse service or fulfillment of any order or to any user.
(b) to discontinue any Product or service.
(c) to bar any user from making or completing a transaction.
and (d) to limit or impose conditions on the honoring of any coupon, coupon code, promotional code, or other similar promotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;For clarification, orders may be limited or cancelled by us or the Seller at any time including after receipt of a confirmation or shipping email.

Partial shipment or partial cancellation of orders may occur.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.5 &nbsp.
&nbsp.
Purchaser Changes and/or Cancellation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In most cases, once an order is placed, it is final and cannot be canceled or changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the fulfilment process begins immediately for most orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may nonetheless request a change from the Seller, and the Seller will notify you if it is possible to cancel or make basic modifications to your order (for example, for Products with longer lead-times).&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic modifications would include changing the size or color of an item, or making a minor update to a delivery address.
It is not possible to change one item to another where the value is different, or to change the delivery address entirely from one address to another.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> If the Seller is unable to cancel or amend your order, (for example if your order has already been shipped), then you will need to initiate a return after your receipt of the order.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of clarity, personalized Product purchases are final, and not eligible for returns.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.6 &nbsp.
&nbsp;RETURNS</strong>
</p>
<p>You may return your order, or any part of your order, in accordance with these terms, for a full refund if you are not satisfied for any reason.

<p>

</p>
<p>If you refuse to accept delivery of all or part of your order (where the products or packaging do not appear to be damaged or defective) any fees and charges incurred by the Seller due to a package being refused may be deducted from your merchandise refund.
The same will apply if the tracking states that delivery has been attempted and the item is awaiting collection from a point of pickup and that item is not collected and returned to the Seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>You will be refunded within fourteen (14) days of the Seller’s receipt of the returned Products.

Messages you send over the Messaging Portal may be viewed by more than one veterinarian or customer support agent and will typically be answered within forty-eight (48) hours.
You should not rely on the Messaging Portal if you need immediate attention from a veterinarian or other health care professional.

Emergency Fund.</strong> If your Subscription includes access to PetVetMD's $3,000 emergency fund (the "Emergency Fund"), you will be subject to our PetVetMD Emergency Fund Terms &amp.
Conditions (which are incorporated by reference herein and which supplement these Terms).
By subscribing to the Emergency Fund, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<p>(<strong>a</strong>) There is a 14-day mandatory wait period upon starting your PetVetMD Subscription before the Emergency Fund is available to you (the “Wait Period”).
If a veterinary doctor determines you are having a life-threatening emergency and need immediate care for your pet before the expiration of the Wait Period, the Emergency Fund will not yet be at your disposal.
You will also be subject to the Wait Period again if you cancel and reactivate your Account.</p>
<p>(<strong>b</strong>) The Emergency Fund is only available to you if your Subscription Fees are made continuously and without interruption.
If the payment method we have on file for you fails, you will lose access to the Emergency Fund.
If you cancel your Account, you will lose access to the Emergency Fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<strong>c</strong>) If you suspect your pet is having a life-threatening emergency and needs immediate care, you must consult our veterinary doctors before gaining access to the Emergency Fund.
All emergencies must be assessed and referred by one of our veterinary doctors through the PetVetMD platform.
A live face to face video call or a video recording is mandatory to determine if it is a life-threatening emergency or not.
You cannot access the Emergency Fund if the pet has been admitted for emergency care prior to contacting one of our veterinary doctors as set forth above.</p>
<p>(<strong>d</strong>) The Emergency Fund only pays for the initial emergency care.
All other follow up care is at the expense of the pet owner.
Additionally, the Emergency Fund will not cover additional costs associated with euthanasia, such as cremation or memorabilia.</p>
<p>(<strong>e</strong>) The Emergency Fund is restricted to a one-time annual pay-out in an amount not to exceed $3,000, regardless of the amount of the emergency.
In other words, you are only entitled to access the Emergency Fund one time during each year of your Subscription, even if the emergency is less than the $3,000 limit.</p>
<p>(<strong>f</strong>) You have up to a maximum of 4 hours to take your pet to an emergency clinic or any veterinary clinic of your choice after being referred by our vets.
If you exceed the 4-hour period to use the Emergency Fund, the funds will not be released for your pet's care.</p>
<p>(<strong>g</strong>) You will not qualify for the Emergency Fund if our veterinary doctors have previously recommended a visit to your vet clinic and you failed to comply.
Waiting to take your pet in for medical care can result in an unnecessary emergency for your pet and we do not support medical negligence.</p>
<p>(<strong>h</strong>) The Emergency Fund only covers your cats and dogs.
No other pets are entitled to participate in the Emergency Fund.
You may be required to provide proof of ownership of your pet in the form of a pet license or registration.</p>
<p>(<strong>i</strong>) You can take your pet to any veterinary clinic located within the United States.
Please keep in mind that some clinics require a deposit before accepting your pet for evaluation.
PetVetMD cannot provide the deposit for you, however, upon receiving the final invoice, the deposit will be included in the final payment issued by PetVetMD.
This means whatever deposit you left upon checking in will be credited back to your account at the discretion of the clinic.</p>
<p>(<strong>j</strong>) The Emergency Fund is non-transferable to other parties and their pets.</p>
<p>(<strong>k</strong>) We do not cover emergencies associated with breeding or pregnancy issues.</p>
<p>(<strong>l</strong>) In order to gain access to your emergency fund, we require completed profiles for all of your pets with their name, age, weight, breed, and a clear photo.
If this information is missing, you will not have access to your emergency fund.</p>
