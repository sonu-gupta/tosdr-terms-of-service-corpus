Information Choices and Changes</b>
</p>
<p>Users may opt out of providing personal information to the Service at any time by uninstalling the application.
Users may also opt out of providing personal information by emailing <b>support@Flipgrid.com</b> to have their account removed or by asking their Discussion Owner to remove their content.
Flipgrid will stop collecting the User’s personal information in these cases, but may still retain the User’s personal information as outlined in the “Data Retention” (Section 8) of this Policy (below).
</p>
<p>Our communication email regarding events, news and other such topics explain how to opt out of receiving such emails.
If a User opts out, we may still send them operational emails that pertain to the User's account and notifications regarding our services.
</p>
<p>Users may send requests about their personal information to our contact information in Section 14 below, including to change contact choices, opt out of our sharing with others, and review, update, correct, or delete personal information.
Once the User has been authenticated, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor these requests.
We may retain an archived copy of User records as required by law.
Such opt outs may result in disruption or cancellation of the Service or impairment of certain Service functionality.
</p>
<p>Users may also contact the Discussion Owner and request that the video be removed.
If the Discussion Owner is not able to remove the video, Users can contact us at <b>support@Flipgrid.com</b> and request that such videos be removed.
However, we will only be able to remove the video if (a) the User provided their email address when posting the video and (b) the User sends the email request to us using that same email address.
Otherwise, we may not be able to remove a posted video.
Deletion of a video removes it from the Group or Topic.
</p>
<p>Discussion Owners have certain options with respect to the privacy settings of their Groups and Topics.
For example, Discussion Owners choose how Users gain access to their Groups and Topic and whether those Groups and Topics are moderated.
Parents and Students should send all requests regarding these privacy settings directly to the Discussion Owner.

<p>
<b>6.
COPPA AND STUDENTS</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>6.1 Notice to Parents and Schools</b>
</p>
<p>Under the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), verifiable parental consent is needed to collect, use, or disclose personal information (e.g., full name and email address) from each User under 13 years old.
In accordance with COPPA, a teacher or Discussion Owner may act as the agent of the parent or legal guardian of a Student and provide consent on behalf of the parent for Flipgrid’s collection, use, and disclosure of the Student’s personal information.
By enrolling a Student under 13 to use the Service, the School provides such consent to us and agrees that the Students’ activities while on the Service are subject to our Terms.
Please see <b>Flipgrid’s Teacher Toolkit</b> (https://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_dos_donts.pdf) and <b>Parent Consent Form</b> (http://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_consent_form.pdf) for guidelines on how teachers and Schools should provide consent on behalf of parents.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not govern any School's collection, use, or disclosure of a Student User’s personal information through the Service, and we are not responsible for any such collection, use, or disclosure.
Parents should contact the teacher or Discussion Owner directly to understand the Discussion Owner’s privacy practices or to request to access, change or delete information collected by the Discussion Owner in connection with the Service that cannot otherwise be accessed, changed or deleted as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>As required under COPPA, parents can make certain choices regarding how their child’s information is used.
(For more information, see “Parent’s Choices Regarding Information on Students Under 13,” in Section 6.2 below).
Parents should submit these requests to the teacher or Discussion Owners, and the teacher or Discussion Owners, as the parent’s agent, must pass those requests to us by emailing <b>support@Flipgrid.com</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>6.2 Parent’s Choices Regarding Information on Students Under 13</b>
</p>
<p>Under COPPA, parents of Students under 13 have certain rights with respect to our collection, use, retention, and disclosure of their Student’s information.
This includes the right to review, update, or delete Student information, as well as prohibit our sharing Student information with third parties.
Parents can exercise these rights by contacting the Student’s Discussion Owner, and the Discussion Owner should submit these requests, on the parent’s behalf, to Flipgrid by emailing <b>support@Flipgrid.com</b>.
Notwithstanding any such requests, we may continue to share the Student information for non-Service purposes as described in Section 3, “Information We Share.” </p>
<p>A parent should request deletion of the Student’s information (such as videos submitted) through the Discussion Owner.
Upon receiving such requests, the Discussion Owner can request deletion of the Student’s information by emailing <b>support@Flipgrid.com</b>.
This will delete the Student information from our live databases.
We will not have any liability whatsoever for any termination of the account or related deletion of the Student information.
When we delete personal information, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives for up to 30 days.
</p>
<p>Schools and Discussion Owners should always obtain parental consent for a Student under 13 to use the Service.
Please see <b>Flipgrid’s Teacher Toolkit</b> (https://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_dos_donts.pdf) and <b>Parent Consent Form</b> (http://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_consent_form.pdf) for tips on how to obtain proper consent from parents.
