</p> 3.
How We Share The Information We Collect
<p>We do not sell your personal information and only share your information as described in this privacy statement.&nbsp;Please note that some state statutes may define a “sale” to include sharing of personal information with third parties for valuable consideration.&nbsp.
Many companies have common arrangements with online advertising networks and analytics companies that may potentially be considered sales under these definitions.&nbsp.
Please review our Additional Notice for California Consumers below for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share your personal information within the McDonald's Family.
The McDonald's Family includes McDonald’s Corporation, our affiliates, our subsidiaries, and our franchisees.
A list of these entities, or where you can find more information, is available at the&nbsp;country's McDonald's website&nbsp;for the applicable privacy statement.
Members of the McDonald’s Family who receive this information from us are not authorized to use or share the information, except as set out in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>We may share your personal information with vendors who provide services to us, such as fulfilling orders, providing data processing and other information technology services, managing promotions, contests, prize draws and sweepstakes, carrying out research and analysis, and personalizing individual McDonald’s customer experiences.
We do not allow these vendors to use this information or to share it for any purpose other than to provide services on our behalf.&nbsp;We may also share your personal information with vendors and partners who use the information to detect or prevent fraud for McDonald’s, and who may use the information to provide fraud detection and prevention services to others.</p>
<p>We may, for strategic or other business reasons, decide to sell or transfer all or part of our business.
As part of that sale or transfer, we may pass information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to anyone involved in the sale or transfer.</p>

Your Choices
Marketing Communications
<p>If you have agreed to receive marketing communications from us, you can later opt out by following the opt-out instructions in the marketing communications we send you.
You can also generally find your communication preferences with instructions on how to opt out in the profile section of the online services that you use.
You may also have the ability to change your communication preferences using your device settings.
You can also opt out by contacting us at our Global or Local Data Protection Office using the contact information provided below.
If you are contacting a Local Data Protection Office, please choose the office in the country in which you are a customer.</p>
<p>If you do opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still send communications to you about your transactions, any accounts you have with us, and any contests, competitions, prize draws or sweepstakes you have entered.
Opting out of one form of communication does not mean you have opted out of other forms as well.
For example, if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, you may still receive marketing text messages if you have opted in to receiving them.
Please note that if you are receiving communications from a McDonald’s franchise, then you will need to opt out from them directly.</p>
<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, unless you give us permission to do so.
When we give you notice, and you consent, we will share your personal information as you direct us to.</p>
Your Personal Information Rights
<p>In certain countries, individuals are entitled to the right to access, correct, transmit, restrict, delete and object to processing of the personal information we have collected.

Use of Our Online Services and Other Technology
<p>We, and our vendors who provide services to us, may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies on our online services and in other areas related to our business, such as online advertising, to collect information and provide you with the services or products that you have requested.</p>
Cookies and other technologies
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that is placed onto an Internet user’s web browser or device and is used to remember and/or obtain information about the user.
Some countries in which we operate may have a cookies policy.
That specific information, by country, is provided below.</p>
<p>A “web beacon” is a small object or image that is embedded into a web page, application, or email and is used to track activity.
They are also sometimes referred to as pixels and tags.</p>
<p>Please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might be assigned a cookie when using our online services.</li>
<li>We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies and other similar technologies.</li>
<li>We may use both session (for the duration of your visit) and persistent (for the duration of a fixed period of time) cookies and other tracking technologies.</li>
<li>Our online services and other areas related to our business may have web beacons.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons and other similar technology, to collect information for the purposes described in this privacy statement.
We may also combine the information collected by these technologies with information we have collected about you by other means that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>We may use these technologies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>uniquely identify you or your device;</li>
<li>allow you to access and use our online services, where without them, our online services may not work properly;</li>
<li>further system security where appropriate;</li>
<li>statistical purposes, in order to measure use of our websites and mobile apps;</li>
<li>improve our products and services;</li>
<li>help us monitor the performance (e.g., traffic, errors, page load time, popular sections, etc.) of our online services;</li>
<li>remember you, for your convenience, when you visit our online services</li>
<li>help customize your experience;</li>
<li>to market to you through targeted advertising.
and</li>
<li>for other purposes described in the section of this privacy statement titled, “How we use the information we collect.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we may use certain technologies to determine whether you have opened an e-mail or selected a link contained in an e-mail, how you use the pages and content in our mobile apps, or whether you have selected a McDonald’s online advertisement.</p>
<p>Both we and others (such as our advertising networks) may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites and devices, and when using our online services to further personalize your experience with us.</p>
<p>Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
Select the “Help” section of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
If you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features available on a website.</p>
<p>Some newer web browsers may have a "Do Not Track" preference that transmits a "Do Not Track" header to the websites you visit with information indicating that you do not want your activity to be tracked.
McDonald’s does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.
We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>
<p>Where video is available on our online services, we may target and track the videos you view.
You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through online services or third-party social media for up to two years, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, or until you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p>More information regarding how cookies and technology are used in a country in which you are a customer may be available in the country specific addendum.</p>
Targeted advertising
<p>When you use our online services, we (and our vendors who provide services to us) may collect information about your activities so that we can provide you with advertising tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>Because we take part in advertising (“ad”) networks, you may see certain ads on other websites.
Ad networks allow us to target the information we send you based on your interests, other information related to you, and contextual means.
These ad networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through use of cookies, web beacons, and web-server logs.
The ad networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be of particular interest to you.
The ad networks we take part in may collect information about your visits to websites that also take part in the relevant ad network, such as the pages or advertisements you view and how you use the websites.
We use this information, both on our online services and on third-party websites that take part in the ad networks, to provide you with advertising tailored to you, and to help us assess how effective our marketing is.</p>
<p>You can opt out of targeted advertising by visiting&nbsp;the Digital Advertising Alliance website&nbsp;or&nbsp;the Network Advertising Initiative website&nbsp;.
If you choose to opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements but they will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

We are not responsible for the policies and practices of third parties.
Any information you give to those organizations is dealt with under their privacy policy, terms and conditions, and other policies.</p>
<p>We may also have providers of other apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our online services, such as Facebook “Like” buttons, which may also use automated methods to collect information about how you use these features.
These organizations may use your information in line with their own policies.</p>

<p>McDonald’s USA is committed to protecting the information of our customers.
The below is meant to provide additional information regarding our privacy practices in the United States.</p>
Children’s Privacy Notice
<p>We understand how important it is to protect your privacy when you use our online services.
We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit or use our online services.
This section (children's privacy notice) is designed to answer your questions about how we use the personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 when they use our online services.</p>
A.
What personal information do you collect?<br>
<p>We offer many features on our sites, such as games and coloring books, which children do not have to provide any personal information.
However, sometimes we may collect personal information, such as an email address, a postal address or phone number, from your child as part of an activity.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of information we collect.</p>
<ul>

How We Share The Information We Collect
<p>We do not sell your personal information and only share your information as described in this privacy statement.&nbsp;Please note that some state statutes may define a “sale” to include sharing of personal information with third parties for valuable consideration.&nbsp.
Many companies have common arrangements with online advertising networks and analytics companies that may potentially be considered sales under these definitions.&nbsp.
Please review our Additional Notice for California Consumers below for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share your personal information within the McDonald's Family.
The McDonald's Family includes McDonald’s Corporation, our affiliates, our subsidiaries, and our franchisees.
A list of these entities, or where you can find more information, is available at the&nbsp;country's McDonald's website&nbsp;for the applicable privacy statement.
Members of the McDonald’s Family who receive this information from us are not authorized to use or share the information, except as set out in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>We may share your personal information with vendors who provide services to us, such as fulfilling orders, providing data processing and other information technology services, managing promotions, contests, prize draws and sweepstakes, carrying out research and analysis, and personalizing individual McDonald’s customer experiences.

<p>We may, for strategic or other business reasons, decide to sell or transfer all or part of our business.

<p>We, and our vendors who provide services to us, may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies on our online services and in other areas related to our business, such as online advertising, to collect information and provide you with the services or products that you have requested.</p>
Cookies and other technologies
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that is placed onto an Internet user’s web browser or device and is used to remember and/or obtain information about the user.
Some countries in which we operate may have a cookies policy.
That specific information, by country, is provided below.</p>
<p>A “web beacon” is a small object or image that is embedded into a web page, application, or email and is used to track activity.
They are also sometimes referred to as pixels and tags.</p>
<p>Please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might be assigned a cookie when using our online services.</li>
<li>We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies and other similar technologies.</li>
<li>We may use both session (for the duration of your visit) and persistent (for the duration of a fixed period of time) cookies and other tracking technologies.</li>
<li>Our online services and other areas related to our business may have web beacons.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons and other similar technology, to collect information for the purposes described in this privacy statement.
We may also combine the information collected by these technologies with information we have collected about you by other means that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>We may use these technologies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>uniquely identify you or your device;</li>
<li>allow you to access and use our online services, where without them, our online services may not work properly;</li>
<li>further system security where appropriate;</li>
<li>statistical purposes, in order to measure use of our websites and mobile apps;</li>
<li>improve our products and services;</li>
<li>help us monitor the performance (e.g., traffic, errors, page load time, popular sections, etc.) of our online services;</li>
<li>remember you, for your convenience, when you visit our online services</li>
<li>help customize your experience;</li>
<li>to market to you through targeted advertising.
and</li>
<li>for other purposes described in the section of this privacy statement titled, “How we use the information we collect.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we may use certain technologies to determine whether you have opened an e-mail or selected a link contained in an e-mail, how you use the pages and content in our mobile apps, or whether you have selected a McDonald’s online advertisement.</p>
<p>Both we and others (such as our advertising networks) may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites and devices, and when using our online services to further personalize your experience with us.</p>
<p>Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
Select the “Help” section of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
If you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features available on a website.</p>
<p>Some newer web browsers may have a "Do Not Track" preference that transmits a "Do Not Track" header to the websites you visit with information indicating that you do not want your activity to be tracked.
McDonald’s does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.
We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>
<p>Where video is available on our online services, we may target and track the videos you view.
You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through online services or third-party social media for up to two years, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, or until you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p>More information regarding how cookies and technology are used in a country in which you are a customer may be available in the country specific addendum.</p>
Targeted advertising
<p>When you use our online services, we (and our vendors who provide services to us) may collect information about your activities so that we can provide you with advertising tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>Because we take part in advertising (“ad”) networks, you may see certain ads on other websites.
Ad networks allow us to target the information we send you based on your interests, other information related to you, and contextual means.
These ad networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through use of cookies, web beacons, and web-server logs.
The ad networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be of particular interest to you.
The ad networks we take part in may collect information about your visits to websites that also take part in the relevant ad network, such as the pages or advertisements you view and how you use the websites.
We use this information, both on our online services and on third-party websites that take part in the ad networks, to provide you with advertising tailored to you, and to help us assess how effective our marketing is.</p>
<p>You can opt out of targeted advertising by visiting&nbsp;the Digital Advertising Alliance website&nbsp;or&nbsp;the Network Advertising Initiative website&nbsp;.
If you choose to opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements but they will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

Any information you give to those organizations is dealt with under their privacy policy, terms and conditions, and other policies.</p>
<p>We may also have providers of other apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our online services, such as Facebook “Like” buttons, which may also use automated methods to collect information about how you use these features.
These organizations may use your information in line with their own policies.</p>

</p> United States
<p>Last updated:&nbsp;<b>July 01, 2020</b>
</p>
<p>McDonald’s USA is committed to protecting the information of our customers.
The below is meant to provide additional information regarding our privacy practices in the United States.</p>
Children’s Privacy Notice
<p>We understand how important it is to protect your privacy when you use our online services.
We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit or use our online services.
This section (children's privacy notice) is designed to answer your questions about how we use the personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 when they use our online services.</p>
A.
What personal information do you collect?<br>
<p>We offer many features on our sites, such as games and coloring books, which children do not have to provide any personal information.
However, sometimes we may collect personal information, such as an email address, a postal address or phone number, from your child as part of an activity.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of information we collect.</p>
<ul>
<li>We may collect your child's email address so that we can tell them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake.
We will tell them using the email address they have given us.
We will not keep the email address beyond its expiration or use it for any other purpose.</li>
<li>We may collect your child's email address to respond to a one-off request from them, such as to send them a screen saver.
In these cases we will promptly delete their email address from our system once we have replied to them, and we will not use the address for any other purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of 13 without the permission of a parent or guardian.
If we need this permission, we will collect your email address so we can tell you how we use information and get your permission to collect information from your child.</p>
<p>We will only ask a child for information that is reasonably necessary for them to take part in any online activity.</p>
B.
How do you use the personal information you collect?<br>
<p>We use the email address your child gives us to respond to requests or to tell them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake they have entered.
We will use your email address to give you details about how we use personal information or to get your permission.</p>
C.
How do you share personal information?<br>
<p>We may share your child's personal information with other people or organizations if it is reasonably necessary, in the following circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>To protect the security or integrity of our online services.</li>
<li>To take precautions against liability.</li>
<li>If we have to reveal the information by law or in response to requests from government authorities.</li>
<li>When we believe sharing the information is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss.</li>
<li>In connection with an investigation of suspected or actual crime.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also may share your child’s personal information with vendors (those who provide services for us).
These services may include hosting our sites, providing technical services, meeting requests or managing a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstake.
We do not allow these vendors to share the personal information we give them unless it is necessary for them to carry out the service for us.</p>
D.
Requests from parents about protecting children's privacy<br>
<p>You can review personal information we have collected from your child that has not been deleted, and can ask us to delete personal information from our records if we have not already done so.
You can also refuse to allow us to further collect or use your child's personal information, even if you have previously given us your permission.
To do this, please email or write to us (our contact details are below).</p>
E.
Who should I contact with questions about children’s privacy?<br>
<p>We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's online activities.
If you have any questions about our children’s privacy practices, please contact us at:</p>

Notice to California residents under 18 years of age<br>
<p>If you are a registered user of online services under the age of 18, and we have actual knowledge of your age, then under California law you may request and obtain removal of certain content or information you have posted on our online services.
To do so, please contact us at the address, phone number or email address below.
Please note that removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content.
For example, removal may not be possible or permitted if another provision of law requires the content to be maintained, if it was posted or reposted by others, or if we paid compensation to you in exchange for the posting.</p>
