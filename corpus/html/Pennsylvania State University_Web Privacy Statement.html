Some Penn State webpages may also have cookies that originate from third parties.

The third-party tools typically utilize cookies but may also use pixel gifs or beacons.
The information generated by the cookie and/or beacons about your use of Penn State websites is transmitted to these tools.
This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the website and to compile statistical reports on activity for our websites.<br>

<br>
If you would like to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, Google has provided a plugin for most browsers that enables this functionality.
