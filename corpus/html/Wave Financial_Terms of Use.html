Third Party Links, APIs and Content.<p>When using Wave or the Services, you may be directed to websites maintained by other third-party service providers.
In addition, some of the functionality of the Services and Wave interoperate with, and are highly dependent upon, application programming interfaces (APIs) from third parties, such as Google and Yahoo!.</p>
<p>The availability of such third-party services (including their APIs) in connection with Wave does not constitute an endorsement, warranty, or representation as to the fitness, suitability, merchantability, title, non-infringement, quality, or accuracy of the third-party provider or its products or services.
If at any point such third-party services cease to make themselves or their APIs available to us on reasonable terms, we may cease to provide those third-party services or any our Services (that are dependent on such third-party services) without providing you with any&nbsp.
refund, credit or other compensation.
Your only recourse is to terminate your subscription and cease using Wave and the Services.&nbsp;</p>

You expressly hold us harmless and hereby release us from any liability whatsoever whether arising out of contract, tort or otherwise for and from any liability or loss arising out of your use of, or inability to use, the products and services of third-party service providers whether or not such use is ancillary to your use of Wave.
If you authorize us to do so, we may grant third parties' access to some or all (depending on the permission you give) of your private data, content and information in your Wave account through our own API for use in connection with their services.

Authorization to Export Data.<p>You acknowledge that we may export your information outside the Province of Ontario and outside of Canada for processing, since we outsource certain information processing to third-party service providers who are resident in the United States.

<strong>Arbitration (“Arbitration Provision”)</strong>
<p>THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS.&nbsp.
IF YOU ARE A CANADIAN CUSTOMER, PLEASE REFER TO PARAGRAPH 9 BELOW.</p>
<p>1.
GENERALLY.
You and the Covered Parties (defined below) agree that any and all disputes and claims between you and the Covered Parties will be resolved by binding individual arbitration.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except for those issues relating to the arbitrability of disputes and the validity, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration provision, including the interpretation of paragraph 7 below, must be determined by a court and not an arbitrator.
For purposes of this Arbitration Provision, references to “you” include your direct and indirect parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates as well as the predecessors, successors, assigns, officers, directors, agents or employees of any of them.
references to “Covered Parties” include Wave Financial, Inc.
and Wave Financial USA Inc., their respective direct and indirect parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates as well as the predecessors, successors, assigns, officers, directors, agents or employees of any of them.&nbsp.
This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of services provided by Wave, whether based in equity, contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise prior to, during, or after the termination of any service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THE COVERED PARTIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>2.
EXCEPTIONS.
You and the Covered Parties agree that nothing in this Arbitration Provision will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit your or the Covered Parties’ right to (i) elect that an individual claim be decided in small claims court as long as it is brought and maintained as an individualized claim, or (ii) bring issues to the attention of federal, state, provincial, or local agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.
PRE-ARBITRATION NOTICE OF DISPUTE.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first mail a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) to the other party.
The Notice to the Covered Parties should be addressed to: Wave-Legal Department, Attention: Notice of Dispute, Wave Financial USA Inc.
1500 Wewatta Street, Ste.
200, Denver CO 80202.
The Notice must be on an individual basis and provide at least the following information: (a) the claimant’s name, telephone number, and e-mail address.
(b) the nature or basis of the claim or dispute.
and (c) the specific relief sought.
If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after the Notice is received, then you or the Covered Parties may file an arbitration.
The existence or substance of any settlement discussions shall not be disclosed.</p>
<p>4.
ARBITRATION RULES.
Any arbitration between you and the Covered Parties will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), or if the AAA determines that you are not a consumer, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Provision or any other instructions that the parties may agree upon at the time (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
If AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Arbitration Provision, the parties shall agree to, or the court shall select, another arbitration provider.
The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of your residence and selected by the parties from the arbitration provider’s national roster of arbitrators.
The arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (1) the arbitrator provider will send the parties a list of five candidates meeting this criteria.
(2) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list, each party shall return its list to the arbitration provider within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference.
(3) the arbitration provider shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking.
and (4) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the arbitration provider will provide the parties a new list of five candidates meeting the above criteria until an appointment can be made.</p>
<p>5.
ARBITRATION COSTS.
Payment of all filing, administrative, arbitrator, and hearing fees will be governed by the applicable AAA rules.&nbsp.
If you inform us that you cannot afford to pay your share of the fees, we will consider advancing those fees on your behalf.
In addition, if the AAA concludes that its Consumer Arbitration Rules apply, we will reimburse you for your share of the fees at the conclusion of the arbitration (regardless of who wins) unless (i) you failed to comply with paragraph 3 above or paragraph 7 below, or (ii) either the substance of your claim or the relief you sought was determined to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), in which case the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and you agree to reimburse the Covered Parties for all fees advanced on your behalf.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp.
HEARING.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your billing address.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp.
NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS.
All arbitrations will proceed on an individual basis and may not proceed in any manner as a class action arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstance unless all parties consent in writing.
YOU AND THE COVERED PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND IN DOING SO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS ACTION ARBITRATION, TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LAWSUIT OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARBITRATION, AND TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED LAWSUIT OR JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION OF ANY KIND.
The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the dispute with the same remedies and defenses available in court, but the arbitrator’s rulings or any relief granted must be individualized to you and will not apply to or affect any other Person or company.
If a court decides that applicable Law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular request for a remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then only that particular claim or only that particular request for a remedy (and only that particular claim or particular request for a remedy) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp.
OTHER TERMS AND INFORMATION.
This Arbitration Provision will be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act and other applicable federal Law.
Except as set forth above in paragraph 7, if any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Provision.
This Arbitration Provision supersedes any prior arbitration agreement between you and the Covered Parties.
No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to any issues or claims in any dispute, arbitration, or court proceeding where any party was not a named party in the arbitration, unless and except as required by applicable Law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.
ARBITRATION FOR CANADIAN CUSTOMERS.
Any claim between you and the Covered Parties (defined below) must be referred to private and confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator chosen by the parties.
For purposes of this provision, references to “you” include your direct and indirect parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates as well as the predecessors, successors, assigns, officers, directors, agents or employees of any of them.

Severance.</strong>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration Provision, all provisions of this Agreement, notwithstanding the manner in which they have been grouped together or linked grammatically, are severable from each other.

If you find an error in these terms, the rest of the terms are still in effect except as otherwise stated in the Arbitration Provision.<br>
