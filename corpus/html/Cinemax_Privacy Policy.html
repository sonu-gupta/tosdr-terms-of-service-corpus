ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
<p>
</p>
<p>On most Sites, we do not knowingly collect information from children.
On some Sites, we may ask the user to provide us with the user's age information.
If the person indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, as permitted by law we will (i) collect no or limited personal information (e.g.
persistent identifier and/or email address only) from that individual, (ii) inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, and/or (iii) collect the email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address.
We use the parent's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity.
Once a parent provides consent, we may use any information from the child consistent with the rest of this Privacy Policy and/or the terms of the consent provided by the parent.
If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
If you would like to review any personal information that we have collected online from your child, have this personal information deleted from our active servers, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's personal information, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com, or at WarnerMedia Privacy Office, 4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg.

If you use or visit our Sites from outside the United States, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of Information we collect from you.&nbsp;</p>
