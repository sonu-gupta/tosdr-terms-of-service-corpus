<p>The Traffic Authority Compensation Plan is an exciting opportunity that rewards you for selling our premium marketing services and for sponsoring other participants who do the same.
Although the opportunity is based on a simple affiliate business model, individual results will vary depending on commitment levels and sales skills of each participant.
Since Traffic Authority has recently launched, it lacks enough statistical data to prepare reliable income disclosures.
The numbers below reflect estimates prepared by the company pending a more detailed survey to be conducted after its first year.
