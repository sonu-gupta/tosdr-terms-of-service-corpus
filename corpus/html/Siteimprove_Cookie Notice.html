1.&nbsp;Processing of Personal Data using Cookies
<p>Cookies enable the Website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
