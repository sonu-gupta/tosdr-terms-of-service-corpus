</ul>Privacy Policy<p>You have come through to this page from a website which is published by a subsidiary of Fairfax Media Limited.</p>
<p>In this policy, "us", "we" or "our" means Fairfax Media Limited (ABN 15 008 663 161) and its related bodies corporate, partnerships and joint venture entities.</p>
<p>This policy sets out:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is considered personal information;</li>
<li>what personal information we collect and hold;</li>
<li>how we collect, hold, use or disclose personal information;</li>
<li>the purposes for which we collect personal information;</li>
<li>what happens if we are not able to collect personal information;</li>
<li>how to seek access to and correct your personal information;</li>
<li>whether we disclose personal information outside Australia.
and</li>
<li>how to contact us.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (subject to exemptions that apply to us under that Act).
However, due to the nature of some of our business activities, from time to time, we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption in the Act where appropriate.
Where we do so, we will ensure that we comply with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards.
We may also rely on related bodies corporate, employee records and other exemptions in the Act.
If you require more information on the collection and use of personal information in the course of journalism, please visit the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards at www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, review and update this policy, including taking account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations.
All personal information held by us will be governed by the most recent updated policy.
Your privacy matters to us, so whether you are new to Fairfax or are a long time user, please take the time to get to know our practices.</p>What is Personal Information<p>When used in this policy, the term "personal information" has the meaning given to it in the Act.
In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you.
This may include (but is not limited to) your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information.
If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.</p>What Personal Information Do We Collect and Hold<p>We may collect the following types of personal information;</p>
<ul>
<li>name;</li>
<li>mailing or street address;</li>
<li>email address;</li>
<li>telephone number;</li>
<li>age or birth date;</li>
<li>profession, occupation or job title;</li>
<li>details of the products and services you have purchased from us or which you have enquired about, together with any additional information necessary to deliver those products and services and to respond to your enquiries;</li>
<li>any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our websites or indirectly through use of our website or online presence through our representatives or otherwise;</li>
<li>information you provide to us through our service centre, customer surveys or visits by our representatives from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>Cookies<p>In some cases we may also collect you personal information through the use of cookies and other tracking devices.
When you access our website, we may send a "cookie" (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number) to your computer.
This enables us to recognise your computer and greet you each time you visit our website, without bothering you with a request to register or log-in.
It also helps us keep track of products or services you view, so that we can send you news about those products or services.
We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our websites have been visited, and to measure transaction patterns in the aggregate.
We use this to research our users' habits so that we can improve our online products and services.
If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them.
We may also log IP addresses (the electronic addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer the website, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p>We may also collect anonymous data (which is not personal information) relating to your activity on our websites (including IP addresses) via cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a survey.
We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of our products and services.
To the extent this information does not constitute personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else, the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by and means whatsoever.</p>How We Collect Personal Information<p>We collect your personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impractical to do so.

These communications may be sent in various forms, including mail, SMS or email, in accordance with applicable marketing laws, such as the Spam Act 2004 (Cth).
If you indicate a preference for a method of communication, we will endeavour to use that method whenever practical to do so.</p>
<p>In addition, at any time, you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by contacting us (details below) or by using the opt-out facilities provided (e.g.
an unsubscribe link), or by updating your personal details on our "MyAccount" webpage.
We will then ensure that your name is removed from our mailing list.

If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity.
There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold.
For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others, or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality.
If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.</p>

We will consider if the information requires amendment.
If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.</p>

Once the Privacy Officer receives a complaint, whether it is in writing or verbal means, the Privacy Officer will commence an investigation with the relevant business unit from which the alleged breach stemmed.
The investigator will endeavour to determine the nature of the breach and how it occurred.
We may contact you during the process to seek further clarification if necessary.
If a breach is found, the Privacy Officer will escalate the matter to management so that the process can be rectified to prevent any further breaches from taking place.
