If you live in the United States, the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver affect your rights under this warranty.
Please read the text under the section titled “Binding Arbitration Agreement.
Class Action Waiver (U.S.

</p>
How Long This Warranty Lasts

For commercial use, VIZIO warrants this product on the terms set forth below for ninety (90) days from the date of original purchase.</p>
What This Warranty Covers
<p>VIZIO warrants the product against defects in materials and workmanship when the product is used normally in accordance with VIZIO’s user guides and manuals.</p>
<p>Except where restricted by law, this warranty applies only to the original purchaser of a new product.
The purchase must have been made from an authorized retailer in the United States (including Puerto Rico) or Canada.
The product must also be located in the country where it was purchased at the time of warranty service.</p>

To determine if this guarantee applies to your product, refer to the model’s product information page at www.vizio.com, look for the “zero bright pixel” guarantee on the box, or contact VIZIO Technical Support at the email address or telephone number below.</p>

<p>Canada — (877) 878-4946&nbsp;</p>
Your Obligations Before Service
<p>You must obtain pre-authorization before sending your product to a VIZIO service center.
You may be required to supply a purchase receipt (or copy) to show that the product is within the warranty period.</p>
<p>When you return a product to a VIZIO service center, you must ship the product in its original packaging or in packaging that affords an equal degree of protection.
VIZIO Technical Support will provide instructions for packing and shipping the product to the VIZIO service center.</p>
<p>ALL USER DATA AND DOWNLOADED APPLICATIONS STORED ON A PRODUCT WILL BE DELETED IN THE COURSE OF SOME IN-HOME AND ALL SHIP-IN WARRANTY SERVICE.
If this occurs, your product will be restored to its original state.
You will be responsible for restoring all applicable user data and downloaded applications.
Recovery and reinstallation of user data and downloaded applications is not covered under this warranty.
In order to protect your personal information, VIZIO recommends that you always clear all personal information from the product before it is serviced, regardless of the servicer.</p>
VIZIO’s Responsibilities
<p>If VIZIO determines that a product is covered by this warranty, VIZIO will (at its option) repair or replace it, or refund the purchase price to you.
There will be no charge for parts or labor during the warranty period.
Replacement parts may be new or recertified at VIZIO’s option and sole discretion.
Replacement parts and VIZIO’s labor are warranted for the remaining portion of the original warranty or for ninety (90) days from warranty service, whichever is longer.</p>
Types of Service
<p>Displays that are 30 inches or larger will usually be serviced in-home.
In-home service requires complete and easy access to the product and does not include de-installation or re-installation of the product.
In-home service is subject to availability.
VIZIO will provide other service options when in-home service is not available.</p>
<p>All other VIZIO products must be sent to a VIZIO service center to obtain warranty service.
VIZIO is not responsible for transportation costs to the service center, but VIZIO will cover return shipping to the customer.</p>
What This Warranty Does Not Cover
<p>This warranty does not cover: (a) cosmetic damage.
(b) normal wear and tear.
(c) improper operation.
(d) improper voltage supply or power surges.
(e) signal issues.
(f) damage from shipping.
(g) acts of God.
(h) customer misuse, modifications or adjustments.
(i) installation, set-up, or repairs attempted by anyone other than by a VIZIO authorized service center.
(j) products with unreadable or removed serial numbers.
(k) products requiring routine maintenance.
or (l) products sold “AS IS”, “CLEARANCE”, “FACTORY RECERTIFIED”, or by a non-authorized reseller.</p>
What to Do If You Are Not Satisfied With Service
<p>If you feel VIZIO has not met its obligations under this warranty, you may attempt to resolve the issue informally with VIZIO.
If you are unable to resolve the issue informally and wish to file a formal claim against VIZIO, and if you are a resident of the United States, you must submit your claim to binding arbitration according to the procedures described below, unless an exception applies.
Submitting a claim to binding arbitration means that you do not have the right to have your claim heard by a judge or jury.
Instead your claim will be heard by a neutral arbitrator.</p>
Binding Arbitration Agreement.
Class Action Waiver (U.S.
Residents Only)
<p>UNLESS YOU HAVE BROUGHT AN ELIGIBLE CLAIM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR HAVE OPTED OUT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR VIZIO PRODUCT, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS WARRANTY, A BREACH OF THIS WARRANTY, OR THE VIZIO PRODUCT’S SALE, CONDITION OR PERFORMANCE, WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION AND CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND ITS SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES.
You may learn more about the American Arbitration Association and its rules for arbitration by visiting www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879.
Since this warranty concerns a transaction in interstate or international commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act will apply.</p>
<p>The filing fees to begin and carry out arbitration will be shared between you and VIZIO, but in no event will your fees ever exceed the amount allowable by the American Arbitration Association, at which point VIZIO will cover all additional administrative fees and expenses.
VIZIO waives its right to recover attorneys’ fees in connection with any arbitration under this warranty.
If you are the prevailing party in an arbitration to which the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes applies, then you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees as the arbitrator may determine.</p>
<p>The dispute will be governed by the laws of the state or territory in which you resided at the time of your purchase (if in the United States).
The place of arbitration will be Irvine, California, or your county of residence (if in the United States).
The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute.
The arbitrator will not award consequential damages, and any award will be limited to monetary damages and will include no equitable relief, injunction, or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Except as may be required by law, neither you nor VIZIO nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this warranty without the prior written consent of you and VIZIO.</p>
<p>ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, IN COURT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
VIZIO AND YOU AGREE THAT NO PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED AS A&nbsp;CLASS&nbsp;ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL&nbsp;ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p>
<p>NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING.</p>
Exceptions to Binding Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver
<p>
<b>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, THEN:</b>&nbsp;(1) you must notify VIZIO in writing within sixty (60) days of the date that you purchased the product.
(2) your written notification must be mailed to VIZIO at 39 Tesla, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn: Legal Department.
and (3) your written notification must include (a) your name, (b) your address, (c) the date you purchased the product, and (d) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver.</p>
<p>In addition, you may pursue a claim in small claims court in your county of residence (if in the United States) or in Orange County, California.
In such case the provisions of the section titled “Binding Arbitration Agreement.
Class Action Waiver (U.S.
Residents)” will not apply.</p>
Exclusions and Limitations
<p>TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THERE ARE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES OTHER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE.
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WILL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD SET FORTH ABOVE.
SOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>VIZIO WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF INFORMATION OR DATA, COMMERCIAL LOSS, LOST REVENUE OR LOST PROFITS, OR OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF VIZIO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
SOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER REMEDY FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES AND DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING VIZIO’S NEGLIGENCE, ALLEGED DAMAGE, OR DEFECTIVE GOODS, NO MATTER WHETHER SUCH DEFECTS ARE DISCOVERABLE OR LATENT), VIZIO MAY, AT ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OPTION AND IN ITS DISCRETION, REPAIR OR REPLACE YOUR PRODUCT, OR REFUND ITS PURCHASE PRICE.
AS NOTED, SOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
How the Law Applies
<p>This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from state to state and province to province.
This warranty applies to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
General
<p>No employee or agent of VIZIO may modify this warranty.
If any term of this warranty, other than the class action waiver, is found to be unenforceable, that term will be severed from this warranty and all other terms will remain in effect.
If the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entire section titled “Binding Arbitration Agreement.
Class Action Waiver (U.S.
Residents Only)” will not apply.
This warranty applies to the maximum extent not prohibited by law.</p>
Changes to Warranty
<p>This warranty may change without notice, but any change will not affect your original warranty.
