This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone.
for example, full IP addresses are not collected and data is deleted after three months at most.
We also respect do-not-track and advise everyone we know (we do it ourselves) to use tools such as VPNs, uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger.</p>
