<p>Website</p>
<p>We use cookies strictly to keep track of authenticated clients.
We do not set any third-party cookies.</p>
<p>We collect and store basic information about your requests to this website (such as IP address, browser agent, referring site, date and time of each request and other activities) for the duration of your subscription, and for up to 1 year after your subscription has ended.</p>
<p>We do not use any third-party analytics.</p> Terms of Service <p>These terms apply to clients of members.ip-api.com and API calls to the pro.ip-api.com endpoint.</p>
<p>Acceptable Use Policy</p>
<p>You can query the ip-api pro endpoint for an unlimited amount of times for the duration that your subscription is active.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to block your API keys or disable your subscription if we believe you are querying the API in an intentionally excessive or abusive manner, for example, if you're querying all possible IPv4 addresses for database mining purposes.</p>
<p>We do not allow reselling of your API keys, subscription, or data returned by the API.</p>
<p>You are responsible for keeping your API keys private.
We recommend setting restrictions for your API keys, so eventual key leaks will prevent potential API abuse.</p>
<p>Response time</p>
<p>We use various techniques to offload, failover and balance traffic to multiple physical servers located around the world.
The pro endpoint has a response time of less than 500ms in most populated areas of the world, and under 100ms in Europe, USA and most of Asia.<br> If you consistently experience higher latencies, we will deploy servers to better serve your area.
Please submit a request at contact@ip-api.com.
</p>
<p>SLA</p>
<p>We strive for a 100% API uptime.
However, if the uptime falls below 99.9% in a subscription month, or if the response time is consistently (for more than 1 hour) over 500ms, we will automatically extend your subscription for 10 days.<br> If your subscription is not automatically extended you can submit a request at contact@ip-api.com with supporting documentation, such as log files showing the non-availability of the API.</p>
<p>The SLA will not apply in the following cases: failure of network routes outside of our control, Denial of Service attacks, or suspension of your account or API keys.</p>
<p>Data</p>
<p>We use multiple sources for populating our database, including BGP, RIR, ISP and data sharing agreements, geofeeds and latency-based tracking.<br> For some IP ranges we fallback to GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from www.maxmind.com<br> We do our best effort to return accurate data, but the information returned may contain errors or be inaccurate.
We do not offer any warranties regarding the correctness of the data returned by the ip-api pro endpoint.</p>
