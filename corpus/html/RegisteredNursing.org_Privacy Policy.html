<strong>The CCPA does not provide these rights to B2B personal information.</strong>
</p> California Residents' Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights <p>You have the right to request that the Company disclose certain information to you about our collection of your personal information over the past 12 months.

First, we will verify your identity.
After we verify your identity, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
You must contact the applicable schools directly to delete your information that they have in their systems.
</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
<li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>

<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act.</li>
<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
</li>
</ol>
<p>We may also limit our deletion to the extent permitted by applicable law.

<p>Only you, or
someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable
consumer request related to your personal information.
You may also make a
verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability <strong>twice</strong> within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collect personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot
respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot
verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal
information relates to you.
</p>
<p>Making a
verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
</p> Timing of our Respond and the Format <p>We will try to
respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of our receipt.
If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period
in writing.</p>
<p>We will deliver
our response to you either via email or mail.</p>
<p>Any disclosures
we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
consumer request's receipt.
The response we provide will also explain the
reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
</p>
<p>For data
portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal
information that is readily useable and should allow you to copy and transmit
the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
</p> Non-Discrimination against California Residents <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that <strong>can result </strong>in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value to the Company and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects.
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
Currently, we do not provide any financial incentives to our users.
