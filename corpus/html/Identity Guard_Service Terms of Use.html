<strong>18.
Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</strong>
<p>MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER'S SATISFACTION BY CALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE AT 877-312-3220.
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAY HAVE WITH AURA OR AURA’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S) TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF AURA AND/OR AURA’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S) HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND AURA AND/OR AURA’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS.
ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.
ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
WE WILL PAY ALL COSTS OF ARBITRATION, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS.
HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND AURA AND/OR AURA’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES FROM EACH OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU AND THEY WOULD BE IN COURT.</p>
<p>You, on the one hand, and Aura and/or Aura’s service provider(s), on the other, agree that any claim or dispute ("Claim") between us shall, at the election of any one of us, be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules for consumer arbitrations.
It is the parties' intent that this arbitration provision be construed broadly, including that this arbitration agreement includes any Claims by You against Aura or Aura’s service provider(s) as well as their respective corporate affiliates for claims arising out of this Agreement directly related to the services or product/service websites.
However, any disputes or claims you may have which relate to your credit report, or any claims arising out of or relating to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and/or the FCRA’s state law equivalent(s), are not subject to or governed by this agreement to arbitrate.
You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, You, Aura and Aura’s service provider(s) are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
At your request, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of your arbitration filing fee.
(The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.
If you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly after receiving a written request).
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual Claim.
YOU, ON ONE HAND, AND AURA AND/OR AURA’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both You, on one hand, and Aura and/or Aura’s service provider(s), on the other, agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's Claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision in the preceding sentence is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision in this Section 18 shall be null and void.

<p>VANTAGESCORE 3.0 CREDIT SCORE: VantageScore 3.0, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, Experian®, TransUnion®, and Equifax®.
VantageScore 3.0 is used by some but not all lenders.
Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders.
A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.</p>
<p>There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file.
Credit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested.
Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies.
So your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different.
Since the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day.
Different credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.</p>
<p>There are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers.
Your lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don't be surprised if your lender gives you a score that's different from your VantageScore.
(And your VantageScore 3.0 may differ from your score under other types of VantageScores).
Just remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes substantially, from a lender’s score.
If the lender's score is lower than your VantageScore 3.0, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.</p>22.
