<p>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Article 1&nbsp.
General</strong>
</p>

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Article 2 Coming into effect of the agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>2.1 An offer and/or quotation from GOOSE will be an invitation to the potential user to choose one of the subscriptions.
The agreement between GOOSE and the user will come into effect when GOOSE accepts the choice of the user electronically.
GOOSE will not be obliged to acceptance thereof.</p>
<p>2.2 The user must generate an account to be able to make use of the VPN service, which account will provide GOOSE with the necessary data for the provision of the service, the payment and the statutory obligations GOOSE must comply with.</p>
<p>2.3 The user must transfer an amount as set out on the website for the verification of the data in the account.</p>
<p>2.4 Following the verification of the account and the acceptance by GOOSE the VPN service will immediately be made available for the user within the preconditions of the chosen subscription.</p>
<p>2.5 The user guarantees the provision of correct personal data to GOOSE, including the address, place of residence, telephone and account numbers.
Changes of personal data must be passed onto GOOSE as soon as possible in writing or electronically.</p>
<p>
<strong>Article 3 Duration, amendment and termination of the agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>3.1 The agreement is entered into for a fixed or indefinite period.</p>
<p>3.2 Following the end of the first agreed period, the agreement for a fixed period will be converted into an agreement for an indefinite period.
Unless GOOSE or the user state electronically or in writing prior to the expiry of the agreed period that they do not wish the agreement to continue.</p>
<p>3.3 The user can choose another subscription at any desired time.
It is possible to extend or to reduce the subscription.
There will be no refund in the event of change to a more restricted (cheaper) subscription.

<p>3.4 The user can cancel the subscription without statement of reason by means of email, telephone or the cancellation form, within the first 30 days.
This arrangement applies only to new users.
Commercial users as well as consumers can make use of this arrangement.</p>

In that case the user will not have the right to refund of the subscription costs paid in advance.</p>
<p>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>

In that event GOOSE will not be liable for potential damage on the part of the user or a third party resulting from the closing down.</p>
<p>5.8 If the user does not act in accordance with the provisions above, GOOSE will be entitled to impose instructions on the user.
The user will be obliged to follow these.

GOOSE will be entitled to change procedures and the technical aspects of the service.</p>

<p>8.2 A failure in the provision of service cannot be attributed to GOOSE if this cannot be blamed on fault on its part, or a cause for which GOOSE is not accountable by law, by legal act or according to generally accepted standards.
These circumstances also include, but are not limited to: power failures, war, environmental disasters, breakdowns of the internet connection, breakdowns in the telecommunication infrastructure, breakdowns of networks, failures on the part of engaged third parties, or suppliers, strike actions and business closures.</p>

The above will not affect any of GOOSE’s other rights on the basis of the law or the agreement.</p>
<p>9.2 If the user is in default GOOSE will provide the service again if the user still fulfils the obligations within the period set out by GOOSE.
The user will owe the costs for this recommencing of the service.</p>
<p>9.3 GOOSE as well as the user can terminate the agreement if the other party does not properly fulfil one or more of the other party’s obligations on the basis of the agreement, insofar as this failure justifies the termination.
If fulfilment is still possible the agreement can only be terminated after the other party has been given demand in writing and the failure is not eliminated within the period stated thereby.</p>
<p>9.4 In the event of (provisional) moratorium, bankruptcy, cessation, or liquidation of (the business of) the user, or if the user is or has become legally incompetent, is placed under a regime of administration, or in any other manner whatsoever loses the free disposition over his/her assets, the agreement will be terminated by operation of law.</p>
