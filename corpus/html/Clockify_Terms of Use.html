<p>Admin undertakes to cause each Regular user with whom such User shares its Workspace(s) to comply with all legal requirements applicable to the use of Service.</p>
<p>Users are fully responsible for all the activities that occur under their User Accounts.</p> 13.
USER CONTENT <p>Users are also solely responsible for all text, documents or other content or information uploaded, entered or otherwise transmitted in connection with your use of the Services and/or Software ( "<b>User Content</b>").
By accepting this Agreement, each User warrants, represents and covenants that the User owns or has a valid and enforceable license to use all User Content.
User Content will not infringe, misappropriate or violate the rights of any person or entity or any applicable law, rule or regulation of any government authority of competent jurisdiction.
Without limiting the foregoing, any feature(s) of the Services and/or Software that may permit you to temporarily save or otherwise store User Content is offered for your convenience only and COING does not guarantee that the User Content will be retrievable.
You are solely responsible for saving, storing and otherwise maintaining User Content including by maintaining backup copies of your User Content on appropriate independent systems that do not rely on the Services and/or Software.</p>
<p>Clockify allows you to store or share User Content or obtain access to the User Content from other Users.
Nevertheless, if a User submits, uploads or creates content as a Regular user on a shared Workspace, User acknowledges and accepts that Admin of that Workspace has exclusive, non-transferable and irrevocable license to access, copy, modify and/or remove such content, including but not limited to adding or removing User from the team or enabling or disabling their or third-party integrations.</p>
<p>COING reserves the right to refuse, limit or cancel the Service, terminate User Accounts, or remove or edit User Content in its sole discretion.
Therefore, when investigating alleged violations of this Agreement, COING reserves the right to review your User Content to resolve the issue (such as to prevent harmful or illegal activity).
COING may also access the User Content when providing technical support or when performing other legal obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, COING has no obligation to monitor User Content (and will make no attempt to do so) and has no obligation to remove any User Content.</p>
<p>COING cannot be held responsible for any loss, damage, expense or other harmful consequences to any User resulting from User Content.</p>
<p>In the event becomes aware of the illegal User Content, activities that infringe anyone's Intellectual Property Rights or personal data or any other right, or activities that infringe these Terms of Use, COING may, in its sole discretion, disable, close, temporarily or permanently limit access to any User Account without any notice.
COING may not be liable for any loss, damages or undesirable consequences resulting from such action.</p> 14.

<p>Without prejudice to the generality of the previous provisions, COING does not warrant that:</p>
<ul>

<li>(c) the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate or reliable,</li>

Accordingly, this Agreement excludes any High-Risk Activities and User agrees not to use the Software in connection with High-Risk Activities.</p>
<p>In connection to Cloud Clockify, COING reserves the right (but has no obligation) to do any of the following, at any time:</p>

<ul>
<li>— with the use or performance of Clockify,</li>
<li>— with the delay or inability to use Clockify and the Service, including the provision of or failure to provide Services,</li>
<li>— with information, Website, Software, products, Service and related graphics obtained through Clockify, or otherwise arising out of the use of Clockify, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that any of the foregoing limitations are deemed unenforceable or in the event any liability of COING is established, to the greatest extent permitted by law, You agree that the entire aggregate liability of COING and sole remedy available to any User in any case in any way arising out of or relating to the Agreement, Software or the Service shall be limited to monetary damages that in the aggregate may not exceed the sum of any amount paid (if any) by that User during the twelve months prior to notice to COING of the dispute for which the remedy is sought.
If the User had no obligation to make such payment during such a period, monetary damages that in the aggregate may not exceed the sum of $100 (hundred dollars).</p>
<p>You agree that this limitation of liability represents a reasonable allocation of risk and is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between COING and you.
You understand that the Website, Services and Software would not be provided without such limitations.</p>
<p>Some countries do not allow the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of this limitation of liability may not apply to you and you may have additional rights.
Nevertheless, if any portion of these sections is held to be invalid under the applicable law, the invalidity of such portion shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the applicable sections.</p>
<p>Section 15 does not exclude mandatory liability for:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Wilful breach by COING of any of its obligations;</li>
<li>(b) Death or personal injury caused by a defective item produced by COING.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither Party shall be liable for breaching its obligations due to a circumstance they reasonably could not have foreseen and which is beyond their control, such as, e.g., a force of nature, an act of a legislative or an executive authority, war, civil unrest, act of terror, strike, non-trivial cyber attack, failure of a third-party hosting, Internet failure or any other circumstance qualifying as force majeure under the applicable law — to the extent that the respective circumstance prevented or hindered the Party's performance.
For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) are not intended to derogate from, or limit the application of, any statutory limitation or exclusion of liability;</li>
<li>(b) shall not be construed to limit the amount of, or excuse User from paying, any fee or other consideration owed hereunder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security policy is applicable only to User Content on Cloud Clockify.
COING has no control and cannot be held liable for the breach of security of any User’s data outside Cloud Clockify (for example, when a User installs Clockify desktop app, some data may be stored locally).
