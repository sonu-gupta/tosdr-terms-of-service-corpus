</ul> Menu PayPal User Agreement PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT About Your Account <p>This user agreement will be effective for all users as of October 31, 2020.</p> Welcome to PayPal! <p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal Pte.
Ltd., a Singaporean company governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.
If you are an individual, you must be a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide</strong> page and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your country/region of residence to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.
If you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide</strong> page to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.</p>
<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.
You also agree to comply with the following additional policies and each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acceptable Use Policy</li>
<li>Alternative Payment Methods Terms</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, the terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.
</p>
<p>We may amend this user agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.
The revised version will be effective at the time we post it on our website, unless otherwise noted.
If our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you with at least 14 days notice.
All future changes set out in the Policy Updates page already published on the Legal Agreements page at the time you register for the PayPal services are incorporated by reference into this user agreement and will take effect as specified in the Policy Update.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to the revised terms and conditions, you must stop using the PayPal services, close your account and terminate your relationship with us without cost or penalty.
This user agreement will continue to apply to your previous use of our services.</p> About our main business <p>PayPal is a payment services provider and acts as such by creating, hosting, maintaining and providing our PayPal services to you via the internet.
Our services allow you to send payments to anyone with a PayPal account, and, where available, to receive payments.
Our service availability varies by country/region.
You can see what services are available in your country/region by logging into your PayPal account.</p>
<p>The PayPal services are offered by PayPal Pte.
Ltd.</p>
<p>
<strong>Consumer Advisory — PayPal Pte.
Ltd., the holder of the PayPal stored value facility, does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Consumers (users) are advised to read the terms and conditions carefully.</strong>
</p>
<p>This user agreement is not a solicitation of the PayPal services and PayPal is not targeting any country/region or market through this user agreement.</p> Opening an Account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.</p>
<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send and receive payments.</li>
<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.</li>
<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods.</li>
<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods from others.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.</p>
<p>In order to open and maintain a PayPal account, you must list your correct country/region of residence and provide us with correct and updated account information, including but not limited to personal information, financial information, or other information related to you or your business.</p>
<p>You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.</p> Personal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send payments to family and friends, a personal account is probably right for you.
With a personal account you can do things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy goods and services.</li>
<li>Send and request payments from friends and family.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>You can also use a personal account to receive payments for the sale of goods and services, but if you plan to use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should consider a business account.
You can convert your PayPal account from a personal account to a business account should circumstances change.</p> Business accounts <p>We recommend business accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services, even if your business is not incorporated.
With a business account, you can do things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your PayPal account.</li>
<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your PayPal account.</li>
<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.</p>
<p>
<strong>By opening up a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.
You also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening, when you request certain new products and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business account.</strong>
</p> Commercial Entity Agreement <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.
In this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.</p> Third Party permissions <p>You must be the beneficial owner of your PayPal account, and conduct business only on behalf of yourself.</p>
<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.
In some cases, you can do this when logged into your PayPal account – in other cases, you can do this directly with the third party.
You acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your PayPal account to this third party.</p>
<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;</li>
<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.
or</li>
<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your PayPal account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.
You are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third parties to carry out.
You will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.</p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost or penalty, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.
When you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.
You must withdraw or transfer any PayPal balance from your PayPal account before closing it.
You cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your PayPal account as payment methods.
However, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.
</p>
<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>To evade an investigation.</li>
<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.</li>
<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.</li>
<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.</li>
</ul> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card or a bank account to your PayPal account as a payment method.
Please keep your payment method information current (i.e.
credit card number and expiration date).
If this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.
If you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.
If we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.
You may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.</p> Holding a PayPal Balance <p>Any PayPal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against PayPal.
PayPal combines your balance with the balances of other users and invests those funds in liquid investments.
These pooled amounts are held separate from PayPal's corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
You will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance.
You agree PayPal shall own the interest or other earnings on these investments.
You agree to assign any rights to any interest derived from your funds to PayPal.</p> Adding or Withdrawing Funds Adding funds to your balance <p>You may use the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to fund transactions you make using your PayPal account.
You don't need a PayPal balance to buy something or send payments.
You can add funds your PayPal account from the bank account that's linked to your PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer to your PayPal account.
The amount transferred will be held as a balance in your PayPal account.
Credit cards cannot be used to add funds to your PayPal balance.</p> Withdrawing funds from your balance <p>If you have a PayPal balance, log into your PayPal account to see which of these withdrawal options are available in your country/region:</p>
<ul>
<li>transferring it to a bank account linked to your PayPal account.
or</li>
<li>transferring it to your debit or credit card, where available.
or</li>
<li>requesting a physical cheque through the mail, where available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the country/region in which your account is registered, you may be able to withdraw your funds through a third party service provider.
Please see terms of such third party for information regarding currency conversions.</p>
<p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).
If we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or the negative balance is fully paid off.</p>
<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.
Completing the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verifying your bank account.
and</li>
<li>Linking and confirming your credit card or debit card information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may charge a fee to make a transfer to your bank account.
If your debit card is eligible to receive withdrawals from your PayPal account, you will be provided the option to use it when you transfer funds out of your PayPal balance, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for personal accounts) page and the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business accounts) page.
The applicable fees will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.</p>
<p>Generally, we will send physical cheques through the mail only to confirmed addresses, unless we have verified your PayPal account.
We will not send cheques to post office boxes.
If you would like us to send a cheque to an address that does not meet these criteria, you must contact customer service and provide the documentation that we request to verify your association with the address.
If you fail to cash a cheque within 180 Days of the date of issuance, we will return the funds to your balance (minus a fee).</p> Managing Your Balance in Multiple Currencies Holding multiple currencies <p>Your PayPal balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by PayPal, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.</p>
<p>If you hold a balance in your PayPal account:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may allow you to convert the balance into another currency.
If you convert the balance in your account, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.
We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of your balance that you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.</li>
<li>You may only withdraw the balance in the opening currency of your account or such other currency that PayPal supports for withdrawal in your registered country/region.
In order to withdraw the balance in your account which is held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.
PayPal's transaction exchange rate, including our currency conversion fee, will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>To receive funds in a currency that your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your PayPal account in that currency or convert the balance into another currency.
Certain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.
If the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in your PayPal account.
You may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.
PayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.</p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.
The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.
The base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.
or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).</p>
<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.
The currency conversion fee applicable can be found on our fees page under the heading Currency conversion fees.</p>Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and involves a currency conversion by PayPal, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.
You may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.
This currency preference selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.
If your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and the fees they may charge.</p>
<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use your existing PayPal balance or your linked bank account is the payment method.</p> Account Statements Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.
You may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT
Sending payments and buying Sending payments to or Receiving payments from a Friend or Family Member Sending payments <p>In some countries/regions, you can send funds to a friend or family member from your PayPal account using the send payments feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called personal payments or peer-to-peer/P2P payments).
</p>
<p>Visit our Available Services by Country/Region of Residence list to see which services are available in your country/region of residence or log into your PayPal account.</p>
<p>You can send funds to a friend or family member even if they don't have a PayPal account at the time you send them funds, using their email address or mobile number, in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.
If the person to whom you are sending funds does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.
If they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you.
Receiving funds from a friend or family member is described under <strong>Receiving Funds</strong>.</p>
<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of funds you can send, including funds you send for purchases.
You can view any sending limit by logging in to your PayPal account.
We may increase your sending limits if you complete the same steps to verify your information as is required for the removal of withdrawal limits.</p>
<p>When you send funds to a friend or family member, one of three things may happen: they may accept, decline or fail to claim the funds.
If they either decline to accept the funds or don't claim them within 30 days of the date they are sent, the funds (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal Credit as the payment method, or</li>
<li>Your PayPal balance, if you used your PayPal balance as the payment method or a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.</li>
</ul> Receiving payments <p>If a friend or family member sends funds to you, the funds will appear in your PayPal balance.
To receive funds in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the funds into another currency.
Certain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.
If the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p> Fees for Sending payments to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending funds can be found in our Sending funds table and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send funds to a friend or family member.
If you convert your PayPal balance from one currency to another, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p>
<p>If you send funds to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.
This will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.</p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal in any currency that the seller accepts, and that PayPal supports, using the funds in your PayPal balance, or using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.
This includes, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.</li>
<li>Sending a payment to a seller for good or services.</li>
<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.
If they don't open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.</p>
<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.
In addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third-party websites or applications, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Express may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;</li>
<li>Some credit cards may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry.
and</li>
<li>Credit cards cannot be used to send personal payments or to top up your PayPal balance</li>
</ul>
<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.
In these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.
In that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).
If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.</p>
<p>If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied as described in the How we convert currency section and will be determined at the time the payment is processed.</p>
Fees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you don't pay a fee to PayPal.
If PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p>
<p>Your credit card or debit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for transactions.</p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.
When this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.
As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.
If we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.
If we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.</p>
Automatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.
This agreement is between you and the seller and allows the seller to take funds from your PayPal account with your authorization on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.
Examples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a "billing agreement," "subscription," "recurring payment," "reference transaction," "preauthorized debit or PAD", "preauthorized transfer" or "preapproved payment."</p>
<p>You may cancel an automatic payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the PayPal Help Centre.
Once an automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.
If you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller funds for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for and you may be required to pay the seller through alternative means.</p>
<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.
If the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.</p>
<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs a currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal's currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.</p>
<p>
</p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal balance.
If you used a bank account as the payment method for the transaction, we will refund the payment to your bank account, or to your PayPal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account.
For purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will be refunded to your PayPal balance.</p>
<p>If PayPal performed a currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:</p>
<ul>
<li>within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) used at the time of the original payment will apply.</li>
<li>beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) on the date of the refund will apply.
The transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.
This means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Payments will be refunded in the currency you paid, or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.</p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction Selecting a preferred payment method <p>In certain countries, you can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.
You can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences.
There may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.</p>
<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions and automatic payments with a seller.</p>
<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.</p>
<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.
</p>
<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.
You can also click on the "Manage" link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.</p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.
In those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.
Note that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for automatic payments.
If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.</p> Sending payments to friends and family <p>When you send payments to friends and family using your PayPal balance (if available) or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.
Remember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the "Change" link on the Send Payments page.
If you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send the payment.</p>
Automatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way to pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.
Often, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.
</p>
<p>You can select a payment method for future purchases with a particular seller either at the time of creating the agreement or in your account settings.
For example, you can instruct your monthly movie subscription service to always charge your credit card for the monthly cost.</p>
<p>If your chosen payment method is unavailable (e.g.
credit card expired), a particular agreement with a seller does not provide for the ability to specify a payment method, or if you have not designated a payment method for future transactions with a seller, the payment method used will be in the following order, as applicable: 1.
balance.
2.
bank account (instant transfer).
3.
PayPal co-branded debit card.
4.
PayPal co-branded credit card.
5.
debit card.
6.
credit card.
and 7.
eCheque.</p>
<p>You can cancel any agreement in your account settings.</p>
Bank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.
For these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.
You authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.</p> eCheque <p>eCheque is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.
This process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside of your country/region.</p>
<p>If eCheque is your preferred payment method, it will be used to fund your PayPal payment, even if you have a balance.</p> PayPal’s Buyer Protection Program PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.
When applicable, PayPal's Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.
PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Buyer Protection program.
PayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.
PayPal's Buyer Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.</p>
<p>PayPal's Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an "Item Not Received" claim), or</li>
<li>You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a "Significantly Not as Described" claim).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Buyer Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions.</p>
Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>will not</em> qualify for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program for an Item Not Received claim if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller's store location, or</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to your address, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.</p> Significantly Not As Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.</li>

Transaction eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.</li>
<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.</li>
<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.</li>
<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.
</li>
<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, and follow our online dispute resolution process.</li>
<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.</li>
</ul>
Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under our Buyer Protection program.
You may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.
The steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 1:</strong>
<strong>Open a dispute</strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.
This might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.
If you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.
We will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 2:</strong>
<strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim</strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.
You can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Centre.
The seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.
PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 3:</strong>
<strong>Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information</strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.
PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.
You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 4:</strong>
<strong>Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner</strong>, if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.
PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.</p>
Proof of delivery means: <p>For transactions that total less than $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/ or postal code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.</p>
<p>For transactions that total $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery (except for buyers having a PayPal account registered: in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, or Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).
If the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.</p>

<strong>Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision</strong> (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.
We may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.</p>
<p>In the event that PayPal makes a final decision in favour of the buyer or seller, each party must comply with PayPal's decision.</p>
<p>If PayPal finds in favour of a buyer, PayPal will reimburse the buyer for the full purchase price of the item and original shipping costs.</p>
<p>In a seller loses a claim, the seller will not receive a refund on the PayPal fees associated with the transaction.</p>
<p>If a seller loses a Significantly Not as Described claim due to the item sold being counterfeit, the seller will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you will not receive the item back.</p>
Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a credit card or debit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.
Applicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.
For example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.</p>
<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Buyer Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.
You can't do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.
If you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us.
This won't affect the dispute process with your card issuer.
In addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.</p>
<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.
If PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).
Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller's return policy.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT
Selling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services Receiving personal payments <p>The ability to receive payments varies by country/region.
You can determine whether you have the ability to receive payments by logging into your PayPal account.</p>
<p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.</li>
<li>Not ask your buyer to send you a personal payment for a purchase.
If you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members.</li>
</ul>
<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.
Such further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Terms.</p>
No surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.
You may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.</p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever PayPal’s branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.
This includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.
Further, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal’s services or marks.</p>
<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal service as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over any PayPal service.
Within all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.
If you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications), you agree to display the PayPal services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.</p>
Taxes, information reporting <p>Some of our fees may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including, for example, value-added tax, sales tax, income tax, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, "taxes") and, unless expressly noted, our fees are exclusive of applicable taxes.
It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.
PayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.</p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy, where required by law.</p>
Payment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.
If PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.
PayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.
If the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.
Otherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.
All payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal Seller Protection requirements.
We will notify you by email and/or through your PayPal account.</p> In-store payments <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.
You may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.
You must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.
You agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.</p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.
Any such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.</p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a "card not present" transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.</p>
Accepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through preauthorized payments either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.
This type of transaction is sometimes called a "billing agreement," "subscription," "recurring payment," "reference transaction," "preauthorized debit or PAD", "preauthorized transfer, "pre-approved payment " or "automatic payment."</p>
<p>If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:</p>
<p>You must:</p>
<p>You must not:</p>
<p>Get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.</p>
<p>Restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancellation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.</p>
<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.</p>
<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.</p> Automatic Transfer Countries <p>If you are a resident of an Automatic Transfer Country, then you have the ability to receive payments, but you must withdraw the full amount of your payment through an available withdrawal method.
If you do not do so, the amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your PayPal account to your withdrawal method on a regular basis.
For additional terms regarding Automatic Transfer, please click here.</p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments Standard transactions fees <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on the buyer's country/region.
The fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Commercial Payments Fees table.
Please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.
We will provide you at least 14 days' advance notice of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.</li>
<li>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.</li>
<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.</li>
</ul> Merchant rate <p>To qualify for our merchant rate, you must submit a one-time application, have a qualifying monthly sales volume, and have a business account in good standing.
To view Merchant rate criteria click here.</p>
Micropayments Fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10 USD.
In order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative PayPal balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.</p>
<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the <strong>Micropayment Fees table</strong> will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of the Commercial Payments Fees.
If you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.
Once a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.</p>
<p>By applying for Micropayments for Digital Goods, you agree that for digital goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the <strong>table</strong>, then if a buyer opens a Dispute, PayPal may reverse the transaction, and remove the funds from your account without requiring the buyer to escalate the dispute to a claim.</p>
PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal's Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.
In order to use these services, you must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a PayPal business account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.
and</li>
<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.
</p>
<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay services, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.
These fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.</p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee described below).
Whenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account in the same currency as the original transaction.
If your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.
PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.</p>
<p>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.
(This will not apply to residents of Mainland China who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.)</p>
<p>The buyer's account will be credited with the full payment amount, or a portion of the payment amount in the event of a partial refund, we'll retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid, and the amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.</p>
Payments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You lose a PayPal Buyer Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.
The card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.</li>
<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.</li>
<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out).</li>
<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.</li>
<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.</li>
<li>The payment was unauthorized.</li>
<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement between you and PayPal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.
If the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of the payment sent to you may be calculated in that currency, using PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed.
If your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will result in a negative PayPal balance.
Any negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your PayPal balance to eliminate it.
If you do not do so, PayPal may:</p>
<ul>
<li>recover any amounts due to PayPal by debiting your balance;</li>
<li>engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;</li>
<li>take any and all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.
or</li>
<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.</li>
</ul>
Dispute fees<p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee</strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout<strong>.
</strong>The <strong>Dispute fee</strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.
The <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;</strong>will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee </strong>rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee </strong>rate.
The <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;</strong>will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.
If the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;</strong>table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.
The <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;</strong>will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dispute fee</strong> amount will be determined when the dispute is created.
The fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.
For example, for a dispute raised in September, your disputes ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July and August.
Your total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions</strong>
<strong>, </strong>and all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.</p>
<p>If your Disputes Ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong> for each dispute.
Otherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee</strong> for each dispute.</p>
<p>You will <strong>
<u>not</u>
</strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee </strong>for disputes that are<em>:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center</strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>
<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>
<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>.</li>
<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection</strong> program.</li>
<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a <strong>Standard Dispute fee.</strong>
</li>
<li>Decided in your favour by PayPal or your issuer.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will <strong>
<u>not</u>
</strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong> for disputes that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center</strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>
<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>
<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees </strong>may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.</p>
<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee</strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.</p>
<p>This Dispute fees section does not apply to residents of Malaysia who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.</p>
Chargeback fees<p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will charge you a chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process.
This fee will apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.</p>
<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.
The chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.
If the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.</p>
<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.
The chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee Table in the currency of the original transaction.
If the transaction is in a currency not listed in the Chargeback Fee Table the fee assessed in your primary holding currency.</p>
Impact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal's Buyer Protection program and if you sell goods and services to and receive payments from buyers with PayPal accounts in countries/regions other than your own, you should also be familiar with the PayPal Buyer Protection available to buyers in each of those countries/regions.
Buyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.
You can find this information for PayPal's programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the applicable user agreement for that geography.</p>
<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal's Buyer Protection program in any country/region:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability.</li>
<li>Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal fees that you were charged for the transaction.</li>
<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.</li>
<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.</li>
<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.
Unless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.
If your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover such claim.
or</li>
<li>Create a negative balance in your PayPal account.</li>
</ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>We offer Seller Protection based on the Seller Protection program for the country/region you selected when you opened your account.
The Seller Protection program for the following countries/regions are part of this user agreement.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Central Europe, Middle East and Africa</strong> (excluding Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries covered by a country/region-specific User Agreement)</li>
</ul> What's eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under <strong>Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks</strong>, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal's Seller Protection program.
When it applies, PayPal's Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.
There is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.
By accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.</p>
<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:</p>
<ul>
<li>They did not authorize or benefit from funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an "<strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>" and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.
or</li>
<li>They did not receive the item from you (referred to as an "<strong>Item Not Received</strong>" claim).</li>
</ul>
<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer's bank.</p>
<p>This section describes PayPal's Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the <strong>Impact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers</strong>.</p>
Basic requirements<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>You provide us with valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery.</li>
<li>The item must be a tangible item except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.</li>
<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.
If you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.
We therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.</li>
<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Centre.
If you do not respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.</li>
<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.
Otherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.</li>
<li>You must accept payment from a PayPal account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).</li>
<li>The payment must be marked “eligible” or “partially eligible” in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.
</li>
</ul>
Item Not Received additional requirement<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection program for a buyer's Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked "eligible" or "partially eligible" for PayPal's Seller Protection on the transaction details page.</li>
<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.</li>
</ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Integration requirements:</li>
<ul>
<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.
or</li>
<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third-party or if you have a native app integration.</li>
<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.
We will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<li>Paid standard transaction fees on the sale.</li>
<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods.</li>
<li>Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table.
If the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.</li>
</ul>
Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>
<strong>Physical Goods</strong>
</p>
<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods:</p>
<p>Proof of shipment</p>
<p>Proof of delivery</p>
<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date of shipment</li>
<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the transaction details page</li>
<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).</li>
</ul>
<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date of delivery and "delivered" status of the item or service.</li>
<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).</li>
<li>Signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes exceeds) the fixed amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table .
Signature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company's website, indicating that the item was signed for (save for Sellers having a PayPal Account registered in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.
Please ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered' status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.</p>
<p>
<strong>Intangible Goods</strong>
</p>
<p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods:</p>
<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.
Compelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.
or</li>
<li>Received or accessed by the recipient</li>

</ul> Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities <p>If we believe that you've engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of actions to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.
The actions we may take include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminate this user agreement, limit your PayPal account, and/or close or suspend your PayPal account, immediately and without penalty to us;</li>
<li>Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you now and in the future;</li>
<li>Limit your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your PayPal account or any of the PayPal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send payments with any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account, restricting your ability to send payments or make withdrawals;</li>
<li>Hold your PayPal balance if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability to PayPal or a third party, or if you have violated our Acceptable Use Policy;</li>
<li>Suspend your eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program and/or PayPal's Seller Protection program;</li>
<li>Contact buyers who have purchased goods or services from you using PayPal, your bank or credit card issuer, other impacted third parties or law enforcement about your actions;</li>
<li>Update inaccurate information you provided us;</li>
<li>Take legal action against you;</li>
<li>Hold, apply or transfer the funds in your PayPal account as required by judgments and orders which affect you or your PayPal account, including judgments and orders issued by courts in Singapore or elsewhere and directed to PayPal or its affiliates;</li>
<li>If you've violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then you're also responsible for damages to PayPal caused by your violation of this policy.
or</li>
<li>If you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.
You acknowledge and agree that $2,500 USD (or equivalent) per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.
PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing PayPal balance in any PayPal account you control.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in your PayPal account available for withdrawal.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, any PayPal customer, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this user agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services.</p> Holds, Limitations and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.
Unless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we'll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.
To request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.</p>
<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.
We may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.
In addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.
We have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.</p>
Holds<p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.
When PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the funds shall not be available to either the sender or the recipient.
PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.
Some common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.</li>
<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.</li>
<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.</li>
</ul>
Holds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.
We make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.
When we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.
We'll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.
</p>
<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 30 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment.
We may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.
The hold may last longer than 30 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.
In this case, we'll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved.</p>
Holds related to Marketplace transactions<p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third-party.
This is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third-party.
These holds will appear in your PayPal account.
If you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third-party directly.</p>
Holds based on disputed transactions<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.
Any of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.
If we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold.
If we determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your PayPal account.</p>
Account Limitations<p>Limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your PayPal account, such as withdrawing, sending or receiving payments.
These limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.
Limitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why we may limit your access to your PayPal account or the PayPal services, and/or limit access to your funds, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.</li>
<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.
Similarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.</li>
<li>In order to comply with applicable law.</li>
<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.</li>
<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.
Examples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks selling an entirely new or high cost product, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we limit access to your PayPal account, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate.</p>
<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.
Normally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.
However, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.</p>
Reserves<p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.
When we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some of the transactions will be shown as "pending" in your PayPal balance, and you will not be able to withdraw funds in a "pending" status, in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.
We make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.</p>
<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors, and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long you have been in business.</li>
<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.</li>
<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.</li>
<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.</li>
<li>Your delivery time frames.</li>
<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, we'll notify you of our actions and the terms of the reserve.</p>
<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A Rolling reserve</strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.
For example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the funds you receive on day 1 are held and then released on day 91, 10% of the funds you receive on day 2 are held until day 92, etc.
Rolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.</li>
<li>
<strong>A Minimum reserve</strong> is a specific minimum amount that you're required to keep available in your PayPal balance at all times.
The minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we'll notify you of the new terms.
</p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.
We will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.
Unless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.
We do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.
When we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place as long as reasonably necessary as determined by PayPal.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT
Liability for Unauthorized Transactions Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.
PayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.
You should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.</p>
<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.
When this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.
</p>
What is an Unauthorized Transaction<p>An "Unauthorized Transaction" occurs when a payment is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.
For example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.</p>
What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction<p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.
You are responsible for transactions made in this situation.</li>
<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.</li>
</ul>
Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction<p>You should contact PayPal customer service immediately if you believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>there has been an Unauthorized Transaction sent from your account;</li>
<li>there has been unauthorized access to your account;</li>
<li>your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen.
or</li>
<li>any device you have used to access your PayPal account has been lost, stolen or deactivated.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must give us all the available information relating to circumstances of any Unauthorized Transactions, and/or misappropriated or unauthorized use of your account, and take all reasonable steps requested to assist PayPal in its investigation.</p>
<p>If you notify us of an Unauthorized Transaction within 60 days of the transaction and we are satisfied that it was an Unauthorized Transaction, you will be eligible for 100% protection for the Unauthorized Transaction.</p> Error Resolution What is an Error<p>An "Error" means the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a processing error made by PayPal or its suppliers in which your PayPal account is mistakenly debited or credited, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.</li>
<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.</li>
<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.</li>
<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.</li>
</ul>
What is not considered an Error<p>The following are NOT considered errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.
You are responsible for transactions made in this situation.</li>
<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.</li>
<li>If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example).
(Your only recourse in this instance will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment.
PayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.)</li>
</ul>
In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers<p>Contact us at our Resolution Centre.</p>
<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.
We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell us your name, email address and account number (if any).</li>
<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.</li>
<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.
We will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days after we receive your notification of the suspected error.

Standard telephone minute and text charges may apply.</p>
<p>PayPal may communicate with you about any PayPal account or transaction information and the PayPal services electronically.
It is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that PayPal can communicate with you electronically.
You understand and agree that if PayPal sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, PayPal will be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively.</p>
<p>Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add PayPal to your email address book so that you will be able to view the communications we send to you.</p>
<p>You can update your primary email address or street address at any time by logging into the PayPal website.

Amounts owed to PayPal <p>If your PayPal balance becomes negative for any reason, that negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to PayPal.
PayPal may set off these amounts from funds that are subsequently added to your PayPal account, either by you or from payments you receive.
If you have more than one PayPal account, we may set off a negative PayPal balance in one PayPal account against a PayPal balance in your other PayPal account(s).
If you continue using your PayPal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize PayPal to combine the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or transaction.</p>
<p>If you hold funds in a PayPal account in multiple currencies, and the balance for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set off the negative PayPal balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency.
If you have a negative balance in non-relevant currency for a period of 21 days or longer, PayPal will convert this negative balance to relevant currency.
In either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to PayPal, our affiliates, or eBay, PayPal may debit your PayPal account to pay any amounts that are past due.
This includes amounts owed by using our various products such as Xoom or Braintree.</p>

No waiver<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p> Indemnification and Limitation of Liability <p>In this section, we use the term "PayPal" to refer to PayPal Pte.
Ltd.
and our affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, joint ventures, service providers and suppliers.

PayPal will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and cheque issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or mail service.

In the event of a conflict between the terms of this user agreement and the terms below, the country/region-specific terms below shall apply:</p>
Mainland China <p>If you are using a service ("Third Party Service") offered by a PayPal partner bank or licensed foreign-exchange service provider (a "Service Provider"), please see the terms and conditions of the Service Provider for additional information relating to that service.</p>
<p>If you are a PayPal seller from Mainland China (i.e.
you indicated Mainland China as your country or region at the point of signing up for a PayPal account), if you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, we will retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid as the seller.
The amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.</p>
<p>In case of any disputes, demands, actions, proceedings ("Disputes") between you and a Service Provider on account of any delay or non-payment of any funds due to you, you hereby indemnify PayPal, PayPal's affiliates and its employees from any damages, claims, charges, expenses and/or losses arising out of such Disputes.

<p>You acknowledge and agree that PayPal may share information provided by you in accordance with PayPal's Privacy Policy and the terms of the agreement between you and PayPal with a Service Provider, including for the following reason.

<p>
<u>Chargeback fees</u>
</p>
<p>If you receive a debit or credit card-funded payment through your PayPal account and the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will not assess you with a chargeback fee if the transaction is eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.
However, if the transaction is ineligible for PayPal Seller Protection, PayPal will assess you with a chargeback fee (for facilitating the chargeback process) regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.</p>
<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.
The chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.
If you do not have the correct currency available in your PayPal balance at the time of the refund or reversal, a currency conversion will be required and a currency conversion fee will apply.</p>
<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.</p>

Except as amended by these terms and conditions, all other provisions of the user agreement remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>
<strong>Amendments</strong>.
We may amend this user agreement and any of the policies and other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to users in Malaysia from time to time.
The revised version will be effective at the time we post it on our website, unless otherwise noted.
If our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities, we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you with at least 21 days’ notice.</p>
<p>
<strong>PayPal suspension and termination rights.</strong> PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the PayPal services, at any time upon notice to you: (i) if you breach this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy, the Commercial Entity Agreements (as they apply to you), or any other agreement between you and PayPal, or (ii) if we determine, acting reasonably, that we should do so due to other circumstances or reasons.
Our determination shall be final and binding except in the case of manifest error or bad faith.
Upon termination of this user agreement, PayPal shall arrange the payment to you of any unrestricted funds held in your PayPal balance.</p>
<p>
<strong>Chargeback fees.</strong> If you receive a debit or credit card-funded payment through your PayPal account and the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will not assess you with a chargeback fee if the transaction is eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.
However, if the transaction is ineligible for PayPal Seller Protection, PayPal will assess you with a chargeback fee (for facilitating the chargeback process) regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.</p>
<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.
The chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.
If you do not have the correct currency available in your PayPal balance at the time of the refund or reversal, a currency conversion will be required and a currency conversion fee will apply.</p>
<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.</p>Morocco <p>Upon enablement of the withdrawal functionality to a Moroccan bank account with the bank partner of PayPal, you will be required to comply with Moroccan laws and regulations.
