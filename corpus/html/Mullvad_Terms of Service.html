Any material changes to these terms will be notified via a prominent notice on mullvad.net/blog at least one month before the changes are applied.
If you wish to exercise your right to reject such changes, you should stop using the service (for refunds, see below).</p> The service <p>The VPN service protects personal information with the use of encryption and masks user metadata by hiding the user's IP address and replacing it with one of ours.
This replacement address is shared with many other users, which not only protects each individual's user data but also hides his or her pattern of activity.
Therefore, the traceable chain between users and their online activity is broken.
Please read more about protecting your privacy at mullvad.net/help/first-steps-towards-online-privacy/.</p>
<p>To protect ourselves, our customers, and the quality of our service, we block TCP port 25 because of email spam and ports 137, 138, 139, and 445 due to a Microsoft security issue.
We also hijack DNS requests (port 53) in order to prevent DNS leaks.</p>
<p>We do not block or filter domains except when requested by the owner of an IP address or when known botnet addresses cause our servers to be null-routed by hosting providers.</p>
<p>We do not modify, redirect, or inject data into users' traffic.</p>
