<p>TRADEMARKS, CELEBRITY MATERIAL AND PRIVACY<br>
<br>GSA responds to complaints that any material appearing on the Website infringes trademarks or celebrity material or infringes privacy and other rights.
Trademarks include logos, brand names, and trade dress, which is the distinctive visual appearance of a product or its packaging.
Please be aware that celebrities, and sometimes others, may have a "right of publicity," which means that they may have a right to control commercial uses of their name, image, likeness, and other aspects of their identity.
Although you may be a fan, you risk infringing celebrity rights if you use the name or likeness of a celebrity or other public figure on the Services and you don't have that person’s permission.
Additional, under privacy, defamation, unfair competition, data protection and other laws in many European countries, any person may have grounds to object to their image or name being used publicly and may require that such use (including in User Contributions) should be discontinued and that such content be removed from the Services.<br>
<br>If you believe your rights have been infringed on the Website or through the Services, please submit a notification of infringement to our agent listed in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act section above.
When submitting a notification of trademark infringement, please provide a copy of the relevant trademark registration (where applicable).
Please also provide the location on the Website where you believe the infringement is occurring.<br>

<p>

<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER<br>
<br>For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and us (including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration.
In the event of any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action, the complaining party must notify the other party in writing thereof.
Within 30 days of such notice, you and we agree to use reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith.
If you and we do not resolve the dispute within 30 days after such notice, the complaining party must seek remedies exclusively through arbitration.
The demand for arbitration must be made within a reasonable time after the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action in question arose, and in no event may it be made after two years from when the complaining party knew or should have known of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence or such other place mutually agreed upon by you and us.
As used in this Section, “we” and “us” mean GSA and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives.
In addition, “we” and “us” includes any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section.</p>
<p>
<br>Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.
The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.
As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”).<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>You should review this provision carefully.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court in the state or municipality of your residence or as otherwise provided in the Rules and Procedures within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court.
Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose.
A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.
You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.
Arbitrators’ decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
(B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.
(c) we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as required by the Rules and Procedures and/or as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration.
(e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.
(f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.
(g) subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law.
and (h) each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>This section will survive termination of these Terms as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us.
With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) of this section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting part was not contained herein.
If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) of this section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>If you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, you must notify us of your election in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision or within 30 days of the effective date of any material change to these Terms by sending a written notice to us by certified mail at the following address: The New York Academy of Sciences, 7 World Trade Center, 250 Greenwich Street, 40th Floor, Attn: Anthony Nguyen, Arbitration Opt-Out.
Your opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone number, and email address.</p>
<p>

<br>
</p>
<p>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>No waiver by GSA of any term or condition set forth in these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of GSA to assert a right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>
<br>Except as expressly provided above in the section titled “Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration.
Jury Trial Waiver.
Class Action Waiver,” if any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the affected provision, if possible, and all other provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>
