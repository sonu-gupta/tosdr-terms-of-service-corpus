<br> How We Collect Your Information <p> We collect information about you in many ways from many places.
Some of the information we collect may include personal information that can be used to identify you.
for example, your name, email address, telephone number, or postal address.
In some countries like those in the EEA, the UK or in states like California, things like IP address or cookie and mobile device identifiers may also be considered personal information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Here are the ways we collect your information:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<u>Please note:</u> We may combine all of the information we collect about you to give you better products, services, and user experiences.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>you provide it to us directly.</strong> You give us your information when signing up for an account on our websites or mobile apps or by calling or emailing us.
We may ask for things like your name, email or home address, date of birth, payment information, your age, gender, the number of people in your family, and the way you want us to send you information about our products and services—for example, to your home address, email address, or by texting you.</p>
<p>
<strong>from sites and emails.</strong> We may use technologies that automatically collect information when you visit our sites, view our advertisements, or use our products or services.
For example, we use cookies (a tiny file stored on your computer’s browser) to tell us what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, web pages you visit, links you click, or whether you have or have not opened an email from us</p>
<p>
<strong>from mobile applications and internet connected devices.</strong> To give you the best possible user experience, we may use technologies that collect information from your phone when you use our mobile apps or our “smart” devices in your home.
You consent to do this when downloading the app or installing household internet connected devices.
This information could include your mobile phone or other device advertising ID, information about your phone’s operating system, how you use the app or device, and your physical location.
You will get a pop up notice on your phone or device that gives you the option to accept or reject allowing us to know your precise geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where you are accessing the internet).</p>
<p>
<strong>from other places.</strong> We may get information that other companies share with or sell to us.
For example, you may have given consent for another company to share your personal information with us when you signed up for telecom services or a retailer loyalty points program.
We may also collect information from places that you know everyone can see, such as from internet postings, blog entries, videos, or social media sites.
We may also receive information from other companies, such as consumer data resellers, who are in the business of collecting or aggregating information about you sourced from publicly available databases (in line with local legal requirements as applicable) or from consent you have given to their use and subsequently our use of your information.
This might be information about your income level, age, gender, number of people in your family, and products you have bought on the internet or from stores in your neighborhood.</p>
<br> How We Use Your Information <p>We use your information to help us meet our purpose of touching and improving the lives of people like you every day around the world.
For example, we use your information to:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform Services </li>
<li>Identify and authenticate you to our different marketing programs and websites</li>
<li>Respond to your questions or requests for information, </li>
<li>Provide customer service </li>
<li>Send transactional messages (such as account statements or confirmations), </li>
<li>Send marketing communications, survey and invitations</li>
<li>Process your payment for the products you buy from us</li>
<li>Process and issue refunds and collections</li>
<li>Send you products or samples you have requested</li>
<li>Help you manage your P&amp;G site or app preferences</li>
<li>Allow you to enter our contests or sweepstakes</li>
<li>Interact with you on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>We also use your information for internal business purposes, such as:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality control, training and analytics</li>
<li>Safety Maintenance and verification</li>
<li>System administration and technology management, including optimizing our websites and applications</li>
<li>Security purposes, including detecting threats and protecting against malicious or fraudulent activity</li>
<li>Recordkeeping and auditing interactions with consumers, including logs and records maintained as part of transaction information</li>
<li>Risk management, audit, investigations, reporting and other legal and compliance reasons</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may also use your personal information to better understand you and our customers generally, including:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>For internal research</li>
<li>To design and develop products, services and programs that delight our consumers</li>
<li>To identify prospective consumers</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Another way we use your information is to track your use of products, services and websites to make sure that what you hear from us is relevant and useful to you as an individual.
For example, we may send you information about Gillette® products if you have shown interest in our shaving products by visiting Gillette.com.
When we do this, we may identify you or your device and associate you with different devices you may use in order to deliver more relevant advertising to you.
We will use your information – a cookie ID or device ID -- to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement from Gillette.
We want you to hear from us about the products you use and love without you hearing the same message We may also use your personal information to learn more about what consumers want so that we can make new products or improve the ones we already have.</p>
<p> We also collect and use your information, including information provided by a third party (e.g., refer-a-friend program), to administer and maintain our financial incentive, rewards, discounts (e.g., price or service coupons) and loyalty programs (collectively, “Rewards Programs”).
We use the information you provide in these programs to verify your identity, offer unique rewards, track your program status, and to facilitate the exchange of program points for products, promotional materials, training workshops, and other items.
If you consent to participate in any of our Rewards Programs, you may withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with the instructions set forth in the applicable Rewards Program’s terms and conditions.
We may use the information gathered from, or related to, participants in our Rewards Programs for any other purpose or in any other manner set forth in this Privacy Policy.
For more information on how we calculate the value of your personal information for Rewards Programs as required under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), please click here.
</p>
<br> How We Safeguard Your Information <p> We respect your personal information and take steps to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration.
Where appropriate, these steps can include technical measures like firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, unique and complex passwords, and encryption.
We also use organizational and physical measures such as training staff on data processing obligations, identification of data incidents and risks, restricting staff access to your personal information, and ensuring physical security including appropriately securing documents when not being used </p>
<br> What We Share <p>
<strong>with other companies.</strong>
<strong>
</strong> When we have your consent, we may share your information with select partners so they can send you offers, promotions, or ads about products or services we believe you may be interested in.
For example, people who receive P&amp;G emails from our diaper brands such as Pampers® may also consent to hear about baby formulas made by other companies.
We do not sell your personal information to marketers outside of P&amp;G in exchange for monetary compensation.
For purposes of California law, however, we may share information with third parties in a way that is considered a “sale”.
Where that is the case, we will comply with California “Do Not Sell” requirements.
For more information, please consult the California Consumer Privacy Rights section of the privacy policy below.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>with service providers.</strong> We may share your information with service providers who help us run our business, including hosting our sites, delivering our emails and marketing communications to you, analyzing the data we collect, helping us with sales attribution (e.g., to see if we showed you an ad on a platform site and then you bought a product from us) and sending you the products and services you requested.
We also share your information with lawyers, auditors, consultants, information technology and security firms, and others who provide services to us.
We share only the personal information needed for these companies to complete the tasks we request.
They are required to protect your information in the same way we do and will not share it or use it for any other purpose than to provide us services.
During the 12-month period prior to this privacy policy’s last update, we may have disclosed data from all of the categories listed in the “What We Collect” section above to third parties for a business purpose depending upon the specifics of the business execution.
<br>
<br>
<strong>other situations.
</strong> If a brand or one of our businesses with which you’ve shared personal data is sold to another company, your data will be shared with that company.
As a result, your account and the personal data in it will not be deleted unless you tell the brand or new company that you want it deleted.
We may also share your information with companies who help us protect our rights and property, or when required by law or government authorities.
</p>

<br> Cookies <p> Cookies are small files sent to your computer as you surf the web.&nbsp;&nbsp;They store useful information about how you interact with the websites you visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies do not collect any information stored on your computer or device or in your files.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies do not contain any information that would directly identify you as a person.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies show your computer and device only as randomly assigned numbers and letters (e.g., cookie ID ABC12345) and never as, for example, John E.
Smith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
</p>
<p> We use cookies for a number of reasons, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li> to serve you with relevant advertising </li>
<li> to learn more about the way you interact with P&amp;G content </li>
<li> help us improve your experience when visiting our websites </li>
<li> to remember your preferences, such as a language or a region, so there is no need for you to customize the website on each visit </li>
<li> to identify errors and resolve them </li>
<li> to analyze how well our websites are performing </li>
</ul>
<p> These are the types of cookies we use: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>session cookies.
</strong> Webpages have no memory.
Session cookies remember you (using a randomly generated ID like: ABC12345) as you move from page to page so that you don’t get asked to provide the same information you’ve already given on the site.
For example, session cookies are extremely helpful when shopping online—without them the items you place in your shopping cart would disappear by the time you reach the checkout! These cookies are deleted as soon as you leave our site or close your browser.
</li>
<li>
<strong>persistent cookies.</strong> Persistent cookies allow sites to remember what you prefer when you come back again.
For example, if you choose to read the site in French on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear automatically in French.
Not having to select a language preference every time makes it more convenient, more efficient, and user-friendly for you.
</li>
<li>
<strong>advertising cookies.</strong> These cookies can be used to learn about what interests you generally might have, based, for example, on the websites you visit and the products you buy.
This can also help us infer things about you such your age, marital status, and how many kids you may have.
That data allows us to send you ads for products and services that better fit the things you like or need.
It also allows us to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement.
</li>
<li>
<strong>analytics cookies.</strong> These cookies tell us how our websites are working.
In many cases, we use Google analytics cookies to monitor the performance of our sites.
Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy .
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>How you can control cookies.
</strong> You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent to your computer.
However, this may prevent our sites or services from working properly.
You can also set your browser to delete cookies every time you finish browsing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Technologies.</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>proximity-based beacons.
</strong> Beacons send one-way signals to mobile apps you install on your phone over very short distances to tell you, for example, what products are on-sale as you walk through a store.
Beacons only talk to your device when you get close enough and after you have given consent within the mobile application associated with a particular beacon.
In turn, apps may provide us location information to help customize advertising and offers to you.
For example, when you are near a beacon in the skin care section of a supermarket, we may send you a $4 off coupon.
<strong>
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>pixels.
</strong> These are small objects embedded into a web page, but are not visible.
They are also known as "tags,” “web bugs,” or "pixel gifs." We use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, monitor our website activity, make logging into our sites easier, and for online marketing activity.
We also include pixels in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>mobile device identifiers and SDKs.</strong> We use software code in our mobile apps to collect information similar to what cookies collect on the internet.
This will be information like your mobile phone identifiers (iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs) and the way you use our apps.
Similar to cookies, the device information we collect automatically as you use our apps will never identify you as a person.
We only know a mobile device as randomly assigned numbers and letters (e.g., advertising ID EFG4567) and never as, for example, John E.
Smith.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>precise geolocation.</strong> We may receive information about your exact location from things like global positioning system (GPS) coordinates (longitude and latitude) when you use our mobile apps.
You will always get a pop-up notice on your phone or device asking for you to accept or reject allowing us to know exactly where you are in the world.
You should understand that we will not always ask for consent to know generally that you are in a broader city, postal code, or province.
For example, we do not consider it to be precise location if all we know is that you are somewhere in Manila, Philippines.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<br> Interest-Based Advertising <p> When you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we believe you would like to see.
For example, you may receive advertisements for Tide® laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that sell children’s clothing or school supplies.
And from that information we may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested in a powerful laundry-cleaning product.
In this way, we intend to send you relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you.
</p>
<p>
<strong> we learn from groups of consumers sharing similar interests.
</strong> We may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same interests.
For example, we may put you in the group of “razor aficionados” if we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a “bargain-shopper” if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts or sales.
We notice these things about you as you look at web pages, links you click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications you use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails.
We group together cookie and device IDs to help us learn about general trends, habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly online and/or offline.
By doing this, we can find and serve many others who “look like” those already in the group and thereby send them what we believe will be relevant and beneficial product offers and information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>we link other information to your cookie and device IDs.
</strong> Your cookie and device IDs may be supplemented with other information, such as information about the products you buy offline or information that you provide directly to us when creating an account on our sites.
We generally do this in ways that will not directly personally identify you.
For example, we could know that cookie ID ABC12345 belongs to the razor aficionado group based on person’s web site visits, age, gender, and shopping habits, but we would not know that person’s name or address or other information that would identify him or her as a person.
Should we ever want to personally identify your cookie or device information (web and app viewing history), we will always ask you before doing so.
</p>
<p>
<strong> we may know you across all of your computers, tablets, phones, and devices.
</strong> We may know that cookie ID ABC12345 is from a computer that that may be connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with device ID EFG15647.
This means that you may search for diapers on your laptop, click on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and then later see an ad for our Pampers® brand diapers on your mobile phone.
We might assume or deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone because, for example, they sign on to the same WiFi network every day at the same time.
Understanding what devices seem to be used by a person or household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across all of your devices.
And this is important because that way you don’t get annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don’t pay for such repetitive ads that we don’t want you to receive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>how you can stop receiving interest-based ads.
</strong>
<strong>
</strong> To stop receiving P&amp;G interest-based advertising, you can click here or click on the AdChoices icon on one of our sites.
You can also prevent getting interest-based ads on websites by declining cookies in your browser(s), declining the “access to data” requests that apps usually present when you install them, or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.
</p>
<p>
<strong> you will still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of interest-based ads.
</strong> Even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from our brands on your computer or mobile devices.
These ads, however, are based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads.
Unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile phone or computer viewing activities, contextual ads are ads shown to you based on the context of the specific site you are visiting.
For example, you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly new or expecting parents as visitors.
You should also know that we may still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer research, or detecting fraud.
</p>
<p>
<strong>deleting cookies also deletes your opt out.
</strong> When you opt out of interest-based advertising, we send an opt-out cookie to your browser that tells us that you no longer want to receive interest-based ads from us.
Your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you decide to delete <u>all</u> cookies.
This means that you will need to opt-out again if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Facebook’s Advanced Matching.</strong> Some of our sites use <u>Facebook’s Advanced Matching</u> features which is a service they offer to advertisers.
Through these features, we will send certain of the information you enter into our site form fields (e.g., your name, email address, and phone number – not any sensitive or special category data) in hashed format (encrypted) to Facebook, or the Facebook pixel will hash (encrypt) and pull that data automatically, for the purpose of helping associate you with your browser cookie or device ID.
We do this so that we can better target and measure the effectiveness of our advertising on Facebook’s platform.
This is how we can know that if we showed you an ad on Facebook, you clicked on it, came to our site and bought something – or not – and therefore whether we should continue to buy ads on Facebook – or not.

<br> EEA and UK Data Processing, Retention, and Transfers <p> This section applies only to our processing of personal data of EEA country and UK residents.
It aims to provide increased transparency into our processing, retention, and transfer of EEA and UK residents personal data that is in line with the letter and spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the GDPR as incorporated into UK law by the Data Protection Act 2018 and amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.

<strong>transfers of your data to other countries.</strong> Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States and the UK.
For example, we may store your data on a server in the United States because that is where a particular database is hosted.
and that data may be “transferred” again when one of our marketers accesses that data from Switzerland to send you a product sample.
Such country may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.
When we transfer your information to recipients in other countries (such as the United States), we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy, and comply with applicable legal requirements by providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to data recipients in countries outside of the EEA or the UK.
To the extent that these data recipients are in countries that have not been recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection, we ensure that appropriate safeguards aimed at ensuring such a level of data protection are in place, including by entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses.
If you would like a copy of a transfer agreement,<u>contact us</u>.</p>
<br> Site and App Content <p>
<strong>plugins.</strong> Our websites may include plugins from other companies such as social networks.
An example of a plugin is the Facebook “Like” button.
These plugins may collect information (e.g., the url of the page you visited) and send it back to the company that created them.
This may happen even if you do not click on the plugin.
These plugins are governed by the privacy policy and terms of the company that created them, even though they appear on our sites.
We act as a controller of that data for our EEA and UK sites for the purposes of collection and transmission of that data.
Such plug-ins are non-essential cookies and will only work on our EEA and UK sites if you accept cookies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>logins.</strong> Our websites may allow you to log in using your account with another company such as, for example, “Login with Facebook.” When you do this, we will have access only to the information that you have given us consent to receive from your account settings in the other company’s account you’re using to log in with.
</p>
<p>
<strong>user content.</strong> Some of our sites and apps will allow you to upload your own content for contests, blogs, videos, and other functions.
Please remember that any information you submit or post becomes public information.
We do not have control over how others may use the content you submit to our sites and apps.
We are not responsible for such uses in ways that may violate this privacy policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.
</p>
<p>
<strong>links.</strong> P&amp;G sites may include links to other sites, which we do not control.
Those sites will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms, not ours.
</p>
<br> Children’s Privacy <p>
<strong>children’s online privacy laws.</strong> We follow all applicable data protection laws when collecting personal information online from children.
For example, in the EEA and the UK we do not collect personal information from children under 16 years of age without the consent of the holder of parental responsibility over the child, unless a lower age is provided for by the local laws – provided that such lower age is not below 13 years..
Similarly, in the U.S., we obtain verified parental consent when collecting personal information from children younger than 13.

<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p> Under the CCPA, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf but the agent will need to complete the verification process, including the submission of proof that it has been designated to act on your behalf.
For access and deletion requests made by an authorized agent on your behalf, we also may require you to verify your own identity directly with us (as described above).
We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise your rights under the CCPA.

<strong>Rewards Programs calculation.</strong> Under the CCPA, you may be entitled to be informed as to why financial incentive programs, or price or service differences, are permitted under the law, including (i) a good-faith estimate of the value of your personal information that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference, and (ii) a description of the method we used to calculate the value of your personally identifiable information.
Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal information.
However, in the event we are required by law to assign such value in the context of Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, we have valued the personal information collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount or financial incentive provided, and the calculation of the value is based upon a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal information collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the transferability of such personal information for us and our Rewards Programs, (iii) the discounted price offered, (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our Rewards Programs, and (v) the product or service to which the Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, applies.
The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards.
