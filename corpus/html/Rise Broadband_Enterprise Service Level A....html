Enterprise services are backed by specific service level guarantees as set forth herein.</p>
<p>
<b>Network Availability Guarantee </b>– 99.99%</p>
<p>The Rise Broadband&nbsp;IP Network, as defined in this section, is guaranteed to be available and capable of forwarding IP packets 99.99% of the time, as averaged over a calendar month.
The Rise Broadband&nbsp;IP Network includes the customer’s access port (the port on the Rise Broadband&nbsp;aggregation router upon which the customer’s circuit terminates) and the Rise Broadband&nbsp;IP backbone network.
The Rise Broadband&nbsp;IP backbone network includes Rise Broadband&nbsp;owned and controlled routers and circuits (including any transit connections).</p>
<p>If the Network Availability guarantee is not met in a calendar month, the customer will receive a credit of 1/90th of the Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) for that month for each full hour of outage under this SLA.
Limits on the credit and the reporting procedures are detailed below.</p>
<p>
<b>Latency Guarantee</b>
<b>&nbsp;</b>– 45 Milliseconds</p>

<b>Credit Limits and Reporting Procedures</b>
