         Refund Policy When to request a refund While we are sympathetic to financial concerns related to COVID-19, we are unable to issue refunds if you will continue to use Packback for the remainder of the term.
In these cases, we will be happy to issue refunds for the reasons listed below.
<p>If you have purchased access to your Packback community, we are
happy to issue refunds for any of the following reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve dropped the class</li>
<li>You’ve accidentally purchased access twice to the same community</li>
<li>Packback is no longer needed due to special circumstances </li>
</ul> For students who have dropped their class <p>If you have<strong> dropped the class</strong>, our Support Team will issue you a refund under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve dropped the course and request a refund up to 14 days after you’ve purchased access to your community</li>
<li>If you’ve dropped the course within 14 days of purchasing access but are requesting a refund late.<strong>
<em> In this case, please provide proof or documentation of your drop date</em>.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases where you need to request a refund after the add/drop period has ended for your course (or more than 14 days after you’ve purchased Packback Questions), refunds will be considered on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the particular circumstances of your refund request.
Refunds requested after the add/drop period for the course has ended (or more than 14 days after the start of the class) are not guaranteed.</p>
<p>However, our team cares deeply about the students who use our platform, and since we cannot anticipate all the cases for which a student might need refund support, we prefer to keep our policy broad and try to work with students to accommodate each situation.</p>
<p>Please note that at the time of being refunded for a Packback Questions Community, you will also be removed from the Community and will not be able to re-add yourself without support from our Product Support team.
You can request a refund for a Packback Questions Community membership here.</p> How to request a refund <p>To request a refund, contact our support team and use the subject line “Refund Request” via our&nbsp;Support Request form.</p>
<p>When you email us to request a refund, please include the email address you used to create your account on Packback and the name of the community you need to be removed from.</p>
