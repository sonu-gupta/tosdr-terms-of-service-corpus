<b>Fraud and Quality Audits</b>
<br> AdWork Media audits every Publisher's traffic on a daily basis.
Publishers that produce or commit fraudulent activities, including false clicks, false impressions, and incentivized clicks (that have not been previously authorized in writing), will have their account permanently suspended from our network and will not be compensated for fraudulent traffic.
If fraud is suspected or detected, Publisher's account will be made inactive pending further investigation.
Publisher accounts are flagged that: </p>
<ul>
<li>Generate click-through/conversion rates that are much higher than industry averages and where solid justification is not evident to the reasonable satisfaction of AdWork Media.
</li>
<li>Generate significant amount of leads with common behavioral characteristics to spammers</li>
<li>Generate fraudulent leads as determined by the Advertisers.
</li>
<li>Use fake redirects, automated software, and/or fraud to generate events from the Programs.
</li>
<li>Multiple completions from the same user agents/hostnames.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Publisher fraudulently adds leads or clicks or inflates leads or clicks by fraudulent traffic generation (such as pre-population of forms or mechanisms not approved by AdWork Media or use of sites in co-registration campaigns that have not been approved by AdWork Media), as determined solely by AdWork Media, Publisher will forfeit its entire commission for all programs and its account will be terminated.
If Publisher is notified that fraudulent activities may be occurring on its Media, and Publisher fails to take prompt action to stop the fraudulent activities, then, in addition to any other remedies available to AdWork Media, Publisher shall be responsible for all costs and legal fees arising from these fraudulent activities.
In addition, in the event that Publisher has already received payment for fraudulent activities, AdWork Media reserves the right to seek credit or remedy from future earnings or to demand reimbursement from Publisher.

Requests for language approval should be sent to Contact@AdWorkMedia.com or your AdWork Media affiliate manger.
</p>
<p>
<b>Scrubbing Leads</b>
<br> Each Program shall have its own criteria for determining the validity of a lead (the "Lead Requirements"), which shall be detailed in the section entitled "Campaign Details" included in the on-site offer summary and the offer-specific instructions emailed by an AdWork Media Affiliate Manager.
AdWork Media shall only pay for net or billable leads ("Billable Leads"), which are determined by taking the gross leads from a Program and deducting Invalid Leads and Returned Leads.
"Invalid Leads" are those leads that do not meet the Lead Requirements or AdWork Media's general quality requirements.
Examples include, but are not limited to, leads that are missing data, do not meet filter requirements, are incorrectly formatted or do not meet certain phone, email and CASS (postal address) validations.
"Returned Leads" are those that have met the Lead Requirements, but are rejected due to inaccurate data or the inability to verify user information.
Examples include, but are not limited to, leads for which the registrant is not at the phone number or address submitted, "unsubscribes" prior to being contacted, is on the "Do Not Call List", replies with "Did Not Request This Information" or the lead is a duplicate in the Advertiser's database.
The AdWork Media proprietary lead processing system is responsible for detecting and tracking Invalid Leads.
The Advertiser is generally responsible for detecting and tracking Returned Leads.
Billable Leads will generally be determined by the 25th of the subsequent month and will be displayed on the AdWork Media site when available.
Accordingly, any statistics regarding Billable Leads appearing on the Site during the month in which the Program is running are preliminary and are subject to adjustment as provided herein.
</p>
<p>
<b>Lead Quality Requirements</b>
<br> AdWork Media routinely audits leads to uphold our quality standards.
We evaluate leads based on IP location and header details passed in transit during redirects through our tracking links.
While we employ many automated fraud checks, some manual quality checks are required.
AdWork Media reserves the right to revoke or decline any lead for lack of quality.
</p>
<p>
<b>Use of Leads</b>
<br> Publisher hereby acknowledges that the collection of the Leads is being done solely for the benefit of AdWork Media or its Advertiser.
Therefore, other than providing the Leads to AdWork Media for delivery to the Advertisers, Publisher may not use, sell, transfer or assign or attempt to monetize the Leads for its own purposes.
All right, title and interest in the Leads shall vest exclusively in AdWork Media or its Advertisers.
</p>
<p>
<b>Contact Information</b>
<br> To insure timely payment, Publishers are responsible for maintaining the correct contact and payment information associated with their account.
Payment Profile information must be updated by the last day of the month to be reflected in the next payment.
This must be done online using the Publisher's account payment details through AdWork Media.com's Publisher platform.
