This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online as well as other Non-PII that we store on your behalf.
PII, as described in US privacy law and in information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.
Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p> What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website or app? <p>When registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, or other details to provide you with our services.
We use your name to personalize your account and allow you to differentiate between accounts when you have multiple accounts set up, without openly displaying your email on the screen at all times.
It is also used to personalize an email that we send to you if we need to correspond with you.
When entering your name you don't have to use your real name, it's just like a nickname for your account.
Your email address is needed to sign in to your account if you are logged out.
One of the main reasons we use an email address as an entry point for WebCull is to provide a recovery point for your account through the `forgot your password` feature.
We do not use your email or PII for marketing, advertising, selling, distributing, or analytics.
We may use your PII to provide the core functionality of the service such as opt-in account alters and account recovery.</p> When do we collect information? <p>We collect information from you when you register on our site or enter information on our site.
We never collect information about you off the site and never wish to.
We do not use third-party tools to collect your information.</p> How do we use your information? <p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:</p>
<p>• To personalize your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</p>
<p>• To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.</p>
<p>• To send periodic emails regarding important information about your account.</p>
<p>• If you have an app purchased from our internal app store that has been configured to send you an email.
Apps are required to allow you to completely control when you get an email.</p>
<p>• To follow up with you after correspondence (live chat or email)</p>
<p>• To reset your account password using the forgot your password feature</p> How do we protect your information? <p>• The data saved to our site is encrypted in multiple ways and our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.</p>
<p>• We use regular Malware Scanning.</p>
<p>• We try to keep up with the latest technology to prevent attacks.</p>
<p>• Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and stored with other encryption technologies.</p>
<p>• We implement a variety of security measures when a user submits or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
<p>• We hire security experts and researchers to try to exploit our code and help us find potential security issues.</p>
<p>• Our apps delivered through our internal app store have been scanned for potential data leaks and app developers are required to completely disclose the way it handles data and communicates with you.
Information about how the data is handled can be found from the Permissions tab on any app page.</p> Do we use 'cookies'? <p>Yes.
Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
For instance, we use cookies to help us remember you with a session so you can log into your account.</p>
<p>We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
We use cookies to:
<p>• Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.</p>
<p>• Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
</p>
<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.
You do this through your browser settings.
Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
<p>Because we use this technology for core site functionality.
If you turn cookies off, the website and features will not function correctly and you will not be able to login or create an account.</p> Third-party disclosure <p>• We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information or any other information you store on our site such as bookmark links, notes, bookmark titles or any related data.</p>
<p>• Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party services on our website.
These services will never be with the intent to track our user, rather to improve the user experience of the site or app (such as Unsplash background, or google fonts).</p>
<p>• These third-party sites we include have separate and independent privacy policies.
We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites have.
Nonetheless, we try to avoid using third-party javascript within our bookmark manager.
The only third-party Javascript we're currently using is Stripe.js to provide you with a secure method of completing a credit card or debit card transaction.</p>
<p>• We do not use Google AdSense or any other third-party tracking tool and never will.
This is something that is not considered standard practice in the industry but our hard privacy stance means we've excluded it from our practices.</p> Anonymous browsing <p>According to CalOPPA (California Online Privacy Protection Act), we agree to the following:</p>
<p>• Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
<p>This privacy policy is always available as a link on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p> You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes: <p>• On our Privacy Policy Page</p>
<p>• By email</p> You can change your personal information: <p>• By logging in to your account, clicking the settings gear at the top right and clicking Account.</p> Data breaches <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
<p>• We will notify you via email within 1 business day</p>
<p>• We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1 business day</p> Collections <p>A Collection is a feature that WebCull offers that allows users to share folders from within their bookmark manager.
It is important to understand that when a folder is turned into a Collection it can now be viewable and shareable to the outside world.
We believe we have put in place the appropriate measures to prevent the accidental sharing of bookmarks by requiring you to both create a Collection URL and enabling it before it would ever become visible to others.
It's important to remember though, if you accidentally drag something into a Collection you will not be warned and it will automatically share that thing with others who have the URL.
It is possible to add a password to a Collection to make it more private.
It's up to you to create a strong password if necessary.
It is good practice to not place a Collection you own near another bookmark or stack of bookmarks that you do not want others to see due to the potential risk of accidentally dragging something personal into the shared Collection.</p> Browser extensions <p>Our browser extensions are designed to improve your experience when using WebCull.
They are not designed to track your web activity or any of your personal information.
They only act as an addition to the services provided already by the WebCull bookmark manager and don't contain any ability to save your personal information besides the bookmarks you save using the extensions.
We never send browsing data such as sites you visit to our servers unless you bookmark it.</p> Integraded App Store <p>The app store contains apps which install on top of the WebCull bookmark manager.
They do have the capability to access and manipulate your bookmarks, settings, and PII.
They have this access to be able to provide useful functionality.
The apps must also follow the principles of WebCull by maintaining your privacy at all costs.
Before you install an app, review the Permissions tab of an app on the app profile page.
App developers are required to answer questions that outline how the app interacts with your bookmarks, account settings, and PII.
Apps are reviewed by our expert review team to make sure our privacy policy and terms of service rules are enforced.</p>
<p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can contact us
and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p> Backups <p>At any time you can delete your account, which will remove all your bookmarks, settings, and PII from our system permanently.
We do create periodic backups of the entire WebCull database which we encrypt, compress, and store for a period of time.
Your deleted information may be stored in backups for some time but will be deleted eventually through our natural purging process.
Backups are almost never used and are used only for emergency measures incase there was lost data.
So far we have never needed to use a backup for anything and they are purged without ever being opened.
We never hold on to a backup for longer than 3 months.</p>
<p>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us using our social media pages or by writing us at info@webcull.com.
