Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), as set forth below.
If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner's) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice, using this form that includes at minimum all of the following information: <ol>

<li> It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.
BeatStars may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and BeatStars may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.
</li>
<li> Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
</li>
<li> We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.
That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.
</li>
<li> Without limiting BeatStars' other rights, BeatStars may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer's access to the Service and any other website owned or operated by BeatStars.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong> Counter - Notification</strong>.
If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to BeatStars is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the following address: <ol>
<li>
<strong>By Mail: BeatStars Inc., 4301 W William Cannon Dr Ste B-150, Austin, TX 787349</strong>

</li>
<li> your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your account.
</li>

and your electronic or physical signature.
</li>
<li> Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.
If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.
However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.
You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

<strong> Dispute Resolution</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>General</strong>
</p>
<p>Certain portions of this Paragraph L are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
You and BeatStars agree that we intend that this Paragraph L satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong> First - Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.</strong> If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, "Dispute"), or to any of BeatStars' actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an "Excluded Dispute", which includes those actions set forth in Paragraph L(1)(b), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.
Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.
But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Paragraph L.
Your notice to us must be sent via email to support@BeatStars.com.
For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, BeatStars and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or BeatStars to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and BeatStars, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.
</li>
<li>
<strong> Binding Arbitration.</strong> If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Paragraph L (1)(a) (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then <strong>ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND BeatStars (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT— INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR NEGLIGENCE,—COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY), WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.
THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PURCHASED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR ADVERTISING AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE.
For U.S.
residents, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between BeatStars and you regarding these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and the Service, including the "No Class Action Matters" Section below.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.</strong> BeatStars and you agree, however, that the applicable state, federal or provincial law, as contemplated in Paragraph L(1)(f) below, shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies, and damages arising between you and BeatStars regarding these Terms and the Service, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to any jurisdiction's choice of law principles.
Any Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules ("Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), except as modified herein, and the arbitration will be administered by the AAA.
If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling to set a hearing then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.
("JAMS") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of BeatStars consent to in writing.
If an in-person arbitration hearing is required and you are a U.S.
resident, then it will be conducted Austin, Texas.
You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.
but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require BeatStars to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Paragraph L to be enforceable, then BeatStars will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who will apply and be bound by these Terms and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.<strong>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions are for the court to decide.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the Service.

<strong> Injunctive Relief</strong>.
The foregoing provisions of this Paragraph L will not apply to any legal action taken by BeatStars to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or BeatStars' intellectual property rights (including such BeatStars may claim that may be in dispute), BeatStars' operations, and/or BeatStars' products or services.
</li>
<li>
<strong> No Class Action Matters.
YOU AND BEATSTARS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION.</strong> Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
<strong>There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated.
But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Paragraph L to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Paragraph L(1)(f).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph L, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein </strong> (described in this "No Class Action Matters" section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator.
The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.
</li>
<li>
<strong> Jurisdictional Issues.</strong> Except where arbitration is required above or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Austin, Texas.
Accordingly, you and BeatStars consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.
</li>
<li>
<strong> Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court of competent jurisdiction.
</li>
<li>
<strong> Governing Law.</strong> These Terms and any Additional Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.

<strong>These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable services to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use).
AS OUR SERVICE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SERVICE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SERVICE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED.
ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.</strong>

<li> Therefore, you should review the posted terms of use and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission).
The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.
However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Service will continue to apply to such prior use (<em>i.e.</em>, changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed.
In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.
</li>
<li> You should frequently check the home page and the email you associated with your account for notices, and you agree that the means set forth in these Terms are all reasonable manners of providing you with notice.
You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Service and related services.
