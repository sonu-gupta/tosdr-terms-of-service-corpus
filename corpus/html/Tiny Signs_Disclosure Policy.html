<p>Sometime I share products for infants and toddlers that I have either used with my own children or recommend to my students.
I will only recommend products that I’m familiar with and love.</p>
<p>You’ll also find Amazon affiliate links because I love their service and prices (and fast shipping!).
If you make a purchase via an Amazon link I get a small commission (at no extra cost to you) – this&nbsp;helps support my small business and I&nbsp;really&nbsp;appreciate it!</p>
