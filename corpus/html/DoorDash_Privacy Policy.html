</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember certain information.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>How We Use Cookies</u>
</i> – We use first-party and third-party cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>to make our Services function properly;</li>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;Web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Site to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track and measure the performance of our Site and Services, monitor how many web visitors we have, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.
Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on webpages (or in an email).</p>

Targeted Advertising</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers, to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices.
If you wish to opt out of such cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your device settings.
We may also use cross-device tracking to help identify our users and serve advertising.
This type of advertising is often called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising—and when it occurs on mobile apps, “cross-app” advertising.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising by visiting (i) the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer <u>Opt-Out link</u> or (ii) the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer <u>Opt-Out link</u>.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the <u>Google Ads Settings page</u>.
California users can also opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising based on your browser by opting out using the Do Not Sell link on the DoorDash.com homepage.
That opt-out is only effective on the browser level and on www.doordash.com.&nbsp.
If you clear your cookies on this browser or use a different browser, you will need to renew your request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements from us.
However, in that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests.
Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>2e.
Mobile Applications</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Depending on your permissions, we may receive your Personal Information from your Internet service and mobile device providers.
Users of mobile devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising may opt-out in several ways.
Learn more about your choices for mobile devices by visiting <u>http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</u>.
Each operating system, (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
You should view your device or system “Settings” to determine how you can opt out of use of your device ID for “cross-app” personalized advertising.</p>

<u>10a.
Your Rights</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>This section lists the privacy-related rights (“Rights”) we extend to DoorDash users.
Your rights are not absolute and are subject to certain exceptions.
For instance, we cannot disclose specific pieces of Personal Information if the disclosure would create a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of the Personal Information, your account with us or the security of our systems.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Right to Know</i> – You have the right to request that we disclose the Personal Information we retain about you.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Deletion</i> – You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information we have collected from you or maintain about you.
We may save Personal Information when permitted by applicable law including, without limitation, when the information is needed for a legal purpose.
If you are a California consumer, we may retain your Personal Information as necessary to: (1) complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between DoorDash and you.
(2) detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity.
(3) debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
(4) exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.
(5) comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.
(6) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when DoorDash’s deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, if you have provided informed consent.
(7) to enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of you based on your relationship with DoorDash.
(8) to comply with a legal obligation.
or (9) to otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Rectification</i> – If you are a registered DoorDash user you may modify certain of your Personal Information by logging into our Site using your username and password and visiting the “Account” page.
Registered DoorDash users may also access the “Account” page to manage their subscriptions.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Personal Information</i> – You have the right to opt-out of having your Personal Information sold.
The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) amends the California Consumer Privacy Act to broadly define “sale” in a way that may include allowing third parties to receive certain information such as cookie identifiers, IP addresses and/or browsing behavior to add to a profile about your device, browser or you.
Such profiles may enable delivery of interest-based advertising by such third parties within their platform or on other sites.
Depending on how you use the Services, we may share the following categories of information for such interest-based advertising which may be considered a sale (as defined by the CPRA): (1) device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies.
and (2) connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage.
Although this obligation of the CPRA does not become effective until January 1, 2023, you may opt out of such tracking technologies by following the instructions in <u>Section 2 above</u>.</li>
<li>
<i>Right to Non-Discrimination</i> – DoorDash will not discriminate against those who exercise their Rights.
Specifically, if you exercise your Rights, we will not deny providing you with goods or Services, charge you different prices or rates for goods or Services or provide you a different level or quality of goods or Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>10b.
Asserting Your Rights</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>You may exercise your Rights by <u>clicking here</u> for DoorDash or <u>clicking here</u> for Caviar.
To verify your identity, you must log-in to your account prior to accessing or deleting your information.
If you have both a Caviar and DoorDash user account, then the information associated with both accounts will be deleted to the extent we can identify that the accounts are owned by the same user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>If you do not have a DoorDash or Caviar account, you may exercise your right to know or your right to deletion by emailing your request to us at <u>privacy@doordash.com</u> from the email address that you believe is associated with DoorDash, with the subject line “Non-user Data Request” or calling us at 855-973-1040.
For safety and to otherwise prevent fraud, we may ask that you provide us with certain personal information that’s reasonably necessary for us to confirm your identity.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>You may also designate an authorized agent to make a request to know or a request to delete.
In order to be able to act, authorized agents have to submit written proof that they are authorized to act on your behalf or have a power of attorney.
We may deny requests from authorized agents who do not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf.</p>
