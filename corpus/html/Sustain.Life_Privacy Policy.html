&nbsp;Exercising rights and making inquiries concerning your personal information.</p>
<p>Depending on your place of residence and applicable laws, you may have certain rights with respect to personal information about you, such as the following rights, which may apply in certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right to access the data – You may have the right to request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you, together with other information about our processing of that personal information.</li>
<li>Right to rectification – You may have the right to request that any inaccurate information that is held about you is corrected, or if we have incomplete information you may request that we update the information such that it is complete.</li>
<li>Right to erasure – You may have the right to request us to delete personal information that we hold about you.
This is sometimes referred to as the right to be forgotten.</li>
<li>Right to restriction of processing or to object to processing – You may have the right to request that we no longer process your personal information for particular purposes, or to object to our processing of your personal information for particular purposes.</li>
<li>Right to data portability – You may have the right to request us to provide you, or a third-party, with a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used machine readable format.</li>
<li>Right to withdraw your consent – Where our processing of your personal information is based on you having provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that these rights are not absolute, and are subject to certain restrictions and exemptions.
&nbsp;For example, the right to erasure of personal information will not apply where we have a legitimate reason to continue to hold such data.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise rights that you may have under applicable law or make similar inquiries, please email us at info@sustain.life or callus at 866-798-2597 and make clear your place of residence.
Please understand that we may take reasonable steps to confirm your identity and to confirm that you hold any rights that you wish to exercise.
If you do not provide information sufficient to verify your identity, we may, in some circumstances, be unable to carry out your request.</p>
<p>Please also understand that we may hold information about you on behalf of one of our clients.
In those cases, we may not be able to accommodate your request to exercise rights, and we will direct you or your request to the business that controls the personal information.
&nbsp;In those circumstances, we are not the controller of your personal data and queries should be directed to the client organization.</p>
