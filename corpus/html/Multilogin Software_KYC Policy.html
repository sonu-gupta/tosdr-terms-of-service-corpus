         KYC Policy
<p>All waiting list applications, as well as product orders, are subject to a verification procedure.
This means that to avoid usage of stolen credit cards and PayPal accounts, we <strong>may</strong> ask you to verify that you’re the owner of a credit card or a PayPal account that you intended to pay with for Multilogin services.</p>
<p>After you sign up for the Multilogin&nbsp;waiting list, we <strong>may</strong> (but not necessarily will) ask you to verify your billing account information.
Here’s how to go about it:</p>
<p>
<b>Options for Paypal and credit card payments (you can choose one of the alternatives): &nbsp;</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Send us a copy of an ID, issued by your Government, which clearly shows your name and picture.
The file will be completely deleted after the verification process</li>
<li>Pass a video interview with our customer support representative</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Options for Bitcoin:&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask to verify Bitcoin payments</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be certain your contact information is correct as applications or orders with an invalid phone number will be cancelled.</p>
<p>We regret that these measures are necessary, but they are designed to protect owners of credit cards and PayPal accounts, as well as, Multilogin.</p>
<p>If a payment is considered high risk, Multilogin may cancel the order at own discretion.</p>
