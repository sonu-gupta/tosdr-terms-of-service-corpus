Your Account
<p>You must create and log into an account to use some features of the forum.</p>
<p>To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself.
If you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date.
You may close your account at any time by e-mailing support@techlore.tech.</p>
<p>You agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the company that your account has been compromised.
You agree to notify the company immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised.
You agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.</p>
<p>The company may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the forum according to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the company reasonably believes that you’ve broken any rule in these terms.</p>
Your Content
<p>Nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the forum, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum.
Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the company’s intellectual property, either.</p>
<p>Between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the forum.
You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the forum is sponsored or approved by the company.
These terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.</p>
<p>Content you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it.
But at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum.
That special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.</p>
<p>When content you submit is removed from the forum, whether by you or by the company, the company’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company’s backups, caches, and other systems.
Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your content is removed.
Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.</p>
<p>Others who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content.
You agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>
Your Responsibility
<p>You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum.
Both you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible.
If the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice.
You agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts.
The company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.</p>

<strong>Other than to seek an injunction or for claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you and the company will resolve any dispute by binding American Arbitration Association arbitration.
Arbitration will follow the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
Arbitration will happen in city_for_disputes.

Otherwise, that provision should be removed.</p>
<p>You may not assign your agreement with the company.
The company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the forum.
Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.</p>
<p>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.</p>

These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.</p>
