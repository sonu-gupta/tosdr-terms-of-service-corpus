<p>Effective on October 1, 2020</p>
<p>At LinkedIn, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you.
This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference.
We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”).</p> What technologies are used? <p>ENTER A SUMMARY</p> Type of technology Description Cookies <p>A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality.
Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers.
We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies.
A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again.
Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services.
Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).</p> Pixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails.
We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts.
Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.
Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s).
Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.
Other similar technologies We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy.
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Our cookie tables list some of the cookies that are used by us and third parties as part of our Services.
Please note that these tables may be updated from time to time to provide you with the latest information.</p> What are these technologies used for? <p>Below we describe the ways in which we may use cookies.</p>
<p>ENTER SUMMARY</p> Purpose Description Authentication <p>We use cookies to recognize you when you visit our Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re signed into LinkedIn, cookies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line with your settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> Security <p>We use cookies to make your interactions with our Services faster, more secure and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> Preferences, features and services <p>We use cookies to enable the functionality of our Services, and provide you with features, insights and customized content.
We also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> Functional <p>We use cookies to improve your experience on our Services.</p> Plugins on and off LinkedIn <p>We use cookies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our plugins may be found on LinkedIn or third-party sites, such as the sites of our customers and partners.
If you interact with a plugin, the plugin will use cookies to identify you and initiate your request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about plugins here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> Personalized Advertising <p>Cookies help us show you relevant advertising, both on and off our Services and measure the performance of such ads and report on it.
We use cookies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone who was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another site.
Similarly, our partners or service providers may use cookies to determine whether we’ve shown an ad or a post and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s or partner’s site or application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see Sections 1.4&nbsp;and&nbsp;2.4&nbsp;of the Privacy Policy.</p> Analytics and research <p>Cookies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations.
We or our service providers use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including as you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices.
We or our service providers, use cookies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn whether you have interacted with our or our customers’ websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also use cookies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with our Services on that browser for up to 30 days in order to generate usage analytics for our Services.
We may share these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p> What third parties use these technologies in connection with our Services? <p>Third parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services.</p>
<p>For example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for their own marketing purposes.
For an illustration, please visit&nbsp;LinkedIn’s Help Center.</p>
<p>Third parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services.
Third parties may use cookies to help us to provide our Services.
We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to analyze and research our Services.</p> Your Choices <p>You have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies.
Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to use cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be as personalized to you.
It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</p> Targeted Advertising <p>As described&nbsp;here, you have choices regarding the use of your personal data for targeted advertising.
Some mobile device operating systems such as Android and iOS provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads personalization.
You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website for both Android and iOS.</p> Browser Controls <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies.
Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies.
To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.</p> Manage Cookie Preferences <p>Where required, we enable you to reject the use of certain cookies for purposes such as advertising and analytics and research, by visiting your cookie settings, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.
For members, your settings can be found&nbsp;here.
For guests, your settings can be found&nbsp;here.&nbsp;You can change your preferences at any time by visiting these settings.&nbsp;Learn more.</p> What is Do Not Track (DNT)? <p>DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings.
As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.</p> Other helpful resources <p>To learn more about advertisers’ use of cookies, please visit the following links:</p>
