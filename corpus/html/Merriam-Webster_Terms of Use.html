<em>Class action waiver</em>.
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.

No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p>
<p>
<em>Arbitration procedure</em>.

If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.&nbsp.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Chicago, Illinois, United States of America, and you and Merriam-Webster agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located there, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.&nbsp.
The arbitrator's award shall conform with these Terms of Use, including without limitation the Limitation of Liability set forth above.</p>
<p>
<em>Claims or disputes must be filed within one year</em>.
To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute must be filed within one year.&nbsp;&nbsp.
