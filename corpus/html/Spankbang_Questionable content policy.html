We understand that certain contents such as zoophilia are legal in some countries and illegal in the others.
However our approach towards these types of content is defined by the governing laws of the majority.<br>
For example Zoohpilia is illegal in majority of countries around the world, therefore we can't allow it on SpankBang.<br>
