<strong>Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 16 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Jacuzzi are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the San Bernardino County or federal courts in the Central District of California, Eastern Division, and you and Jacuzzi each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
<strong>16.&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>
<strong>.</strong>
<p>
<strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</u>.
We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be resolved <strong>solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding</strong>.
You and Jacuzzi agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Jacuzzi are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<u>Exceptions</u>.
As limited exceptions to Section 16(a) above: (i)&nbsp;we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>(c)&nbsp;</strong>
<u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</u>.
The arbitration will be conducted by the JAMS pursuant to its rules then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules.
All other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (collectively, the “JAMS Rules”).&nbsp.
The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com (under the Rules/Clauses tab) or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the JAMS rules, including JAMS’ Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in the JAMS Rules.</p>
<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location.
The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<u>Arbitration Costs</u>.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, including JAMS’ Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards, as applicable, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>
<p>
<strong>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</u>.
Except as provided in Section 16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
<p>
<strong>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<u>Class Action Waiver</u>.
<strong>YOU AND JACUZZI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>
<p>
<strong>(g)&nbsp;</strong>
<u>Severability</u>.
