<p>RECITALS</p>
<ol>
<li>WHEREAS,&nbsp;honeygain has developed technology – an Application that allows users, via their device, to share their internet traffic with&nbsp;honeygain and its customers.
User’s device becomes a gateway that allows&nbsp;honeygain to send traffic&nbsp;by&nbsp;using user’s device and its internet traffic.
This shared internet traffic will be used by&nbsp;honeygain and its&nbsp;clients.</li>
<li>WHEREAS,&nbsp;honeygain allows users to monetize shared internet traffic, by modifying user’s device network sharing settings so they could become a gateway for internet traffic.&nbsp;Subsequently,&nbsp;user’s device is used as a gateway by&nbsp;honeygain’s&nbsp;clients, who, among&nbsp;others, include companies that specialize in web and market analytics, SEO monitoring, brand protection, market research, cybersecurity, etc.</li>
<li>WHEREAS, user by installing the Application and agreeing to this Agreement desires to monetize &nbsp;and utilize its internet traffic.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE,&nbsp;in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:</p>
<p>Table of Definitions</p>
<p>
<strong>Dashboard –&nbsp;</strong>the principle communication tool between honeygain and its users.
Used to provide important and most relevant information regarding the Application, such as accumulated Credits, Earnings, pricing models, important notices, etc.
The Dashboard can be accessed through&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>
<strong>Application –&nbsp;</strong>the current version of the Application made available by&nbsp;honeygain to user pursuant to this Agreement, including any software (source code and object code), programs, tools, libraries, APIs, data, files, Application specifications, documentation and any updates, upgrades, bug fixes, patches, new releases, new versions of any of the foregoing that may be made available by&nbsp;honeygain to users pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>Content Delivery&nbsp;</strong>(“CD”) - CD is honeygain’s functionality that allows its desktop users to share their internet traffic through different method than the one used in the default scenario.
CD functionality is different &nbsp;because upon user’s consent its device is used to reach more bandwidth intensive content such as images, videos, audio, streaming services, heavy websites, IPTV, etc.
CD has separate and additional earning and payout rules.</p>
<p>
<strong>Shared traffic&nbsp;</strong>– The amount of internet traffic that the user has shared and honeygain (or Clients) has used through the user's device.</p>
<p>
<strong>Earnings&nbsp;</strong>– means the amount calculated in accordance with the pricing rules established herein and payable to the user by honeygain.</p>
<p>
<strong>Credits –&nbsp;</strong>digital asset of honeygain’s network that is allocated to user’s account for the Shared traffic and has value attributed to it by honeygain.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing &nbsp;rate&nbsp;</strong>– the amount of Credits gained per 1GB of Shared traffic.</p>
<p>
<strong>Conversion rate –&nbsp;</strong>the monetary value attributed to Credits as provided in the&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>
<strong>Clients –&nbsp;</strong>honeygain’s business clients that use the traffic shared by users for various business purposes i.e.
gathering data from the web for pricing, brand, market analysis, verifying advertisement efficiency, etc.</p>
<p>Honeygain</p>
<p>User having installed Application and agreeing to the terms of this Agreement will become part of honeygain network of users that share their internet traffic with honeygain and are awarded Credits.
Credits can be later paid out as Earnings in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Becoming part of the honeygain network means that the user willingly shares his internet traffic with honeygain and Clients.
Clients are not aware which specific users’ internet traffic they are using, nor users know which Client uses their internet traffic.
Normally, the Client requests for internet traffic that could be shared from a specific country (i.e.
Brazil) or region (i.e.
South America) and honeygain can either grant or deny such requests depending on the quantity, location and / or honeygain functionality options of users that participate in honeygain’s network at the time.</p>
<p>In accordance with the above, it also means that not all users will be able to share the same amount of traffic, as it essentially depends on whether there is demand for their internet traffic or not.
Moreover, it also means that if there is a surplus of supply of internet traffic from specific location, honeygain retains the right to&nbsp;limit&nbsp;the sharing of internet traffic of specific users to protect honeygain network from overutilization.
In order to ensure the quality of internet traffic to Clients and to maximize the possible profit for our users we limit the number of devices that can be attributed to a specific IP address at a single instance.
We might also limit the usage types of IP addresses connected to honeygain network.
These limitations can change and are always disclosed in our FAQ.</p>
<p>By using our Application and agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, you understand and agree that Shared traffic might be used by various businesses with various business cases.
Some of the use cases might include advertisement verification which may result in the user getting specific advertisement when browsing the internet.
Other Clients might gather data from the web which might later result in users getting&nbsp;captchas&nbsp;when attending certain websites.
Some of our Clients might also use our service to access and / or provide streaming services, etc.
There is also an unlikely possibility that in case you have a streaming services account and our Client uses your device as an exit gateway to access the same streaming service platform, that you would become unable to use said services for limited amount of time.
The Clients who use Honeygain for the latter use case would mainly use traffic that is generated by users who opted in to our CD functionality.
While we do put reasonable effort to prevent any detrimental consequences to our users, it is the user who is responsible for its ability to share internet traffic and his compliance with local laws, regulations and agreements with third parties.</p>
