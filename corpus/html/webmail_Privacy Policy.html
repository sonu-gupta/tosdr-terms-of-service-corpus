Privacy Policy With Webmail, your email is private and secure <p>At Webmail, we understand that your privacy is very important to you.
That is why we are committed to keeping your personal information confidential.</p>
<p>When you sign up for Webmail, you choose your personal ID and password.
The only way you can access your account is by using the password you select.
This means that only you will have access to your Webmail account, even if you use a computer at a public terminal or a friend's house.
However, you must always remember to log out to maintain security.&nbsp;</p> Junk Mail <p>We know that junk mail is invasive and annoying.
We strive to protect you from Spam in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will never sell your address</li>
<li>We will constantly monitor and protect your inbox from unwanted mail.</li>
<li>Should advertisers wish to communicate directly, we will do so on their behalf once we are certain that your interest profile matches the deal and that it offers true value.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp.
</p>
<p> To protect yourself, we suggest that you give out your address with care, particularly to other websites.
