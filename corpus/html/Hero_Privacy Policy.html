Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Remember that your use of Hero Health’s Services is at all times subject to the&nbsp;Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the&nbsp;Terms of Use.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.&nbsp.
We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and Services, and to analyze how you use the Services.
In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As noted in the&nbsp;Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18.
If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us.
If we learn that we have collected personal information from an individual under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at&nbsp;support@herohealth.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Will Hero Health ever change this Privacy Policy?</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to material changes by placing a notice on the App, on the&nbsp;https://herohealth.com/website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.&nbsp.
If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.&nbsp.
Use of Personal Information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information is collected.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What Personal Information does Hero Health Collect?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Information you provide to us:</em>

<ul>
<li>Certain apps on your phone (such as: Contact list, Email, Text messaging)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Third-party account credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may use the Personal Information you provide to us to operate, improve, understand and customize our Services for you.&nbsp.
For example, if you provide your medical data to us, you understand we may use such data to improve and personalize our Services for you and/or to identify, select and contact you about offers, including offers to participate in certain features of the Services that we think may interest or benefit you, such as beta and/or new features that may entail sharing your information with a third party service provider.&nbsp.
Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Specifically, we may use medication data that you provide us in order to determine whether you are a good fit for additional Services we may offer, including Hero Fill.&nbsp.
Our use of your medication data for this purpose will be internal to Hero Health, and will only be used by our marketing teams to send you information and offers related to Hero Fill.&nbsp.
We will not share any medication data with third parties, including any pharmacy partners, before you sign up for Hero Fill.&nbsp.
You hereby acknowledge and consent to our use of your medication data in order to market our Hero Fill to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so.
For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services, including emails about Service announcements, updates or offers.&nbsp.
Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.
This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.&nbsp.
If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by updated your account preferences or applicable opt-out hyperlink(s).
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You authorize Hero Health Inc.
and its service providers or affiliates to contact you at the phone number, or physical and/or electronic mail address(es) you provide, including wireless numbers even if you registered the number with a Do Not Call list, via telephone, electronic mail, postal mail, SMS texting, voicemail, and/or by using automated dialing technology, for all marketing and advertising purposes.

<em>Information collected automatically</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested.
“Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.&nbsp.
You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services.
Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you.&nbsp.
Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.&nbsp.
Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Cookies can either be “session cookies” or “persistent cookies”.&nbsp.
Session cookies are temporary cookies that are stored on your device while you are visiting our website or using our Services, whereas “persistent cookies” are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our website or Services.&nbsp.
We’ve provided a quick summary of some of the cookie types we and our service providers use on the Service, but for more information about cookies, visit&nbsp;http://www.allaboutcookies.org&nbsp;or&nbsp;http://www.aboutcookies.org.uk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential Cookies:&nbsp.
Essential cookies are required for providing you with features or Services that you have requested.
For example, certain cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services.
Disabling these cookies will make certain features and services unavailable.</li>
<li>Functional Cookies:&nbsp.
Functional cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services.
These cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences.</li>
<li>Performance/Analytical Cookies:&nbsp.
Performance/analytical cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the website, what pages visitors view on our website and how long visitors are viewing pages on the website.
Performance/analytical cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Service’s content for those who engage with our advertising.</li>
<li>Retargeting/Advertising Cookies: Retargeting/advertising cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.&nbsp.
We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>Information collected from other websites and “Do Not Track” policy</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.&nbsp.
Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.&nbsp.
Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Will Hero Health share any of the Personal Information it receives?</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Caregivers.</strong>&nbsp.
If you authorize a Caregiver to link to your account, we will share Personal Information with the Caregiver.&nbsp.
You can revoke access to a Caregiver at any time through your account settings.&nbsp.
If you revoke access to a Caregiver, we will no longer share your Personal Information with that Caregiver, but we do not have control over any Personal Information the Caregiver may have retained prior to have his or her access revoked.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hero Fill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>If you choose to subscribe to Hero Fill, we will share certain information with our pharmacy partners solely to the extent necessary for you to receive Hero Fill, including your name, address, and information about your prescription(s).&nbsp.
You may choose to unsubscribe from Hero Fill at any time in accordance with the&nbsp;Limited Warranty, Returns and Cancellations Policy.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information that’s been de-identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners.
We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.
However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Advertisers:</strong>&nbsp;We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“<strong>Advertisers</strong>”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers.
For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.&nbsp.
Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.&nbsp.
Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
We may also provide certain information about you (such as your name, email, and mailing address) to our partners to create a “look-alike” audience for marketing purposes, which helps us target users that may be interested in our Services.
We will never share identifiable health or medication data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network.&nbsp.
Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.&nbsp.
Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.&nbsp.
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.&nbsp.
You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser.
please note that we don’t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong>&nbsp;In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).&nbsp.
You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.
One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.
We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Agents:</strong>&nbsp;We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you (such as hosting, payment processing, fulfillment, data storage, security, web service analytics or ad serving) and/or who make certain services, features or functionality available to our users on our behalf.
Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>User Profiles and Submissions:</strong>
<em>
<strong>
</strong>&nbsp;</em>Certain User Submissions, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our Services.&nbsp.
Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others, including Caregivers.&nbsp.
Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone.&nbsp.
Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,” if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile.&nbsp.
Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Business Transfers:</strong>&nbsp;We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.<em>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</em>Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Protection of Hero Health and Others:</strong>&nbsp;We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order.
enforce or apply our&nbsp;Terms of Use&nbsp;and other agreements.
or protect the rights, property, or safety of Hero Health, our employees, our users, or others.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is Personal Information about me secure?</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.&nbsp.
If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service.&nbsp.
You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.&nbsp.
Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What Personal Information can I access?</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>

<li>medications&nbsp;</li>
<li>Caregivers</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.&nbsp.

&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What choices do I have?</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.&nbsp.
When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.&nbsp.
You may request deletion of your account by&nbsp;support@herohealth.com.&nbsp.
Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account.
We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that if you choose to turn on the Do Not Track function on your browser, we may continue to use all information we collected prior to your turning that function on, in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
