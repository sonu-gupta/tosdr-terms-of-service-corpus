<br>
We currently do not allow IRC or IRC bots to be operated on our servers.
<br>
<br>

<br>
(1) debit the client's credit card (when such information has been provided by the client).
or

<br>
When an invoice is delivered to the client, payment shall be remitted to Spry Servers, LLC by no later than the specified payment due date.
Spry Servers, LLC shall be entitled to immediately terminate this agreement for client's failure to make timely payments.
You will be provided with an invoice on either a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.
All credit cards, if on file, will be billed automatically within 15 days following the invoice date.
It is the client's responsibility to ensure that they have sufficient credit to cover this transaction.
In the event that there is insufficient credit, we will send an e-mail notification, at which point we will need to be provided with another credit card account number within 24 hours.
If we do not receive a response within 24 hours, the account, and all accounts under that account plan, will be suspended.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Service Fees</strong>
<br>
Certain services carry a setup fee charged by Spry Servers, LLC to client, which must be paid by client in order to have use of said services.
If client terminates this agreement, client shall be responsible for any and all outstanding fees owed to Spry Servers, LLC and agrees to pay any and all fees incurred by client.
Because the services are provided on a monthly basis, the client will be responsible for service fees incurred each month, regardless of when client provides notice of termination.

Revision date: 05/13/21
As a provider of web site hosting and other Internet-related services, Spry Servers, LLC offers its customer (also known as “Subscribers”) and their customers and users the means to acquire and disseminate a wealth of public, private, commercial and non-commercial information.
Spry Servers, LLC respects that the internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information.
However, when there are competing interests at issue, Spry Servers, LLC reserves the right to take certain preventive or corrective actions.
In order to protect these competing interests, Spry Servers, LLC has developed an <strong>Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”)</strong>, which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer’s respective service agreement, and is intended as a guide to the customer’s rights and obligations when using Spry Servers, LLC’ services.
This AUP will be revised from time to time.
<br>
<br>You will be held responsible for all actions performed by your account whether done by you or by others! If server security is compromised, the account holder is responsible for all violations of Spry Servers’ Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service” or "TOS") and this Acceptable Use Policy (this “AUP”), including SPAM, and all disconnect and reconnect fees associated with violations.
<br>
<br>One important aspect of the internet is that no one party owns or controls it.
This fact accounts for much of the internet’s openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use it, both in the information they acquire and in the information they disseminate to others.
When subscribers obtain information through the Internet, they must keep in mind that Spry Servers, LLC cannot monitor, verify, warrant or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information they acquire.
For this reason, the subscriber must exercise his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained from the internet, and also should be aware that some material posted to the internet may be sexually explicit or otherwise offensive.
Because Spry Servers, LLC cannot monitor or censor the internet, and will not attempt to do so, Spry Servers, LLC cannot accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers or the general public, resulting from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal internet communications.
<br>
<br>The Primary Purpose of Spry Servers is to provide our clients with the resources necessary to bring their internet services online in a reliable, lightning fast, high availability environment which responds quickly to each clients' individual needs.
<br>
<br>The client is ultimately responsible for individual server security.
Spry Servers disclaims all liability for server content.
<br>
<br>When subscribers disseminate information from the internet, they must keep in mind that Spry Servers, LLC does not review, edit, censor or take responsibility for any information its subscribers may create.
When users place information on the internet, they have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech.
Also, because the information created is carried over Spry Servers, LLC's network and may reach a large number of people, including both subscribers and non-subscribers of Spry Servers, LLC.
Subscribers’ postings to the Internet may affect other subscribers and may affect Spry Servers, LLC’s goodwill, business, reputation or operations.
For these reasons, subscribers will be in violation of Spry Servers, LLC's policy and the Service Agreement when they, their customers, affiliates or subsidiaries engage in the following prohibited activities:
<br>
<br>
<strong>Network Misuse:</strong>
<br>
All clients are allowed access to the public and private network.
however misuse of the network in any way, including interference, will result in a violation of this AUP.
All violations of this AUP shall be subject to review by Spry Servers, and an appropriate course of action shall be taken as determined by Spry Servers, Spry Servers' sole discretion.
Proper use of public network must comply with all local, state, and federal laws.
Clients assume full liability for all content which they place on the server.
Forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or newsgroup posting is deemed a violation of this AUP.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Disk-based Crypto Mining</strong>
<br>
Mining for disk-based cryptocurrencies including, but not limited to "Chia" is strictly prohibited across all our products.
(Colocation services are exempt from this policy) If clients are caught mining cryptocurrency with their hard disks or SSDs, their accounts will be immediately terminated without refund.
If any damage has occurred to the disks, the customer agrees herein to pay all costs associated with replacement of the disks.
Spry Servers reserves the right to debit the customers' credit card or other payment method to recover any damages.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Spamming (General Policies)</strong>
<br>
Sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial information over the internet.
Any activities of this type, including, but not limited to SPIM, Spam and SPIT, are expressly prohibited.

Additionally, maintaining an open SMTP relay is prohibited.
<br>
<br>Spry Servers reserves the right to deny mail delivery from any servers hosted on our network and/or suspend service, if they are believed to be involved in Spam, SPIM or SPIT activities.
This includes spam support services such as DNS or spamvertised web sites.
Our abuse department will locate abusive servers based on public blacklist monitors, abuse reporting from external networks, and other means.
If our abuse department receives a report or otherwise becomes aware of abuse-related activities active on our network, we will identify the server the abuse was initially sent from (via IP and in some cases by domain)
<br>
<br>In this event, your account is subject to immediate termination with or without notification, at our discretion.
NO refund will be given.
<br>
<br>Spry Servers reserves the right to refuse services to any client whose account(s) have been fined or terminated for abuse-related activities.

4.
Habitual security compromises that result in abusive traffic being transmitted or received from the server may result in service termination.
<br>

Clients may not operate and maintain IRC servers which connect to global IRC networks such as Undernet, EFnet and DALnet.
Use of IRC plug-ins, scripts, add-ons, clones or other software designed to disrupt or deny service to other users is prohibited.
If a client’s IRC servers are frequently compromised or attract denial of service or distributed denial of service attacks that disrupt or deny service to other clients or users, then Spry Servers may null-route, filter, suspend, or terminate that client’s service.
Spry Servers allows the use of both Peer to Peer as well as Bit Torrent, but we do not permit the transfer of illegal content.
Use of IRC/Bittorrent/P2P on shared hosting is strictly prohibited.
