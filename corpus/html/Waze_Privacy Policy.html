See “How does Waze use aggregated information”, below;</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this
Privacy Policy.</p> Sharing your information Personal information that you share <p>The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with Waze and with other
members of that community.</p>
<p>In particular, users may choose to share personal information such as name, age, gender, picture,
their location information, reports and other files.
This information may be shared either directly
to the Services and to all users, such as in the case of traffic reports, or just to your friends on
Waze.
This information may also be shared via third party services (such as social networks) which
interact with the Services upon such users’ choice.
For more information about your Carpool profile
(if you choose to set one), see section titled Waze Carpool Profile below.</p>
<p>
<strong>You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services.
However any content that you
choose to share and submit for posting is neither private nor confidential and you should expect
that it may be made public and known to others.</strong> Information you choose to upload will be posted
along with your user name and other information including personal information you attached to your
publicly available user profile.
For example, your reports (map and road updates, traffic congestion
updates, road accidents, etc.) will be posted on the Waze map along with your username.
You should
note that certain road incidents you report may include your driving path within the vicinity of
those incidents.
Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information.
At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal
information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.</p>
<p>In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social
network accounts according to your privacy settings for such social network accounts), your email
address will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.</p>
<p>if you choose to either record your own voice onto the Service, or to use the voice command
features, Waze will collect the voice information related to such use, including voice files.
If,
after recording your own voice, you chose to share your voice recordings, other Waze users and other
people will be able to download and use your voice recordings.
Once downloaded, Waze may not have
any control over the voice files, so you should only share content that you are comfortable being
made public.</p>
<p>We, at Waze, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using
the Services.
However, Waze has no control over the conduct of any user and disclaims all liability
in this regard.
Users are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public
or available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any
communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being made.</p>
<p>Participating in any user’s activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using Waze, is
entirely at your own risk.
Waze is not a party to any agreement entered into between the users in
any circumstances.
The user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all
laws, regulations or any other duty.
We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or
expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your participation in any
activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any
agreement between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way,
directly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.</p> When Waze shares your information <p>Waze does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>Waze will not share your personal information with others, without your permission, except for the
following purposes and to the extent necessary in Waze’s good-faith discretion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As necessary for the facilitation and operation of the Services.
For example, making public road
incidents you report and which are associated with your username and your location;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Waze reasonably believes that you have breached the Terms of Use or is investigating potential
breach of the Terms of Use, or believes that you abused your rights to use the Services, or
performed any act or omission that Waze reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law,
rules, or regulations.
Waze may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement
agencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as may be required to handle any
result of your wrongdoing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Waze is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to share or disclose your
information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and Waze, or between you and
other users with respect to, or in relation with the Services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any case where Waze reasonably believes that sharing information is necessary to protect
against harm to the rights, property or safety of Waze, our users, or the public as required or
permitted by law, including to prevent imminent physical damage or damage to property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Waze organizes the operation of the Services within a different framework, or through another
legal structure or entity, or if Waze is acquired by, or merged into or with another entity, or if
Waze enters bankruptcy, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions
of this Privacy Policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To collect, store, hold and manage your personal information through cloud based or hosting
services or a third party or a party affiliated or connected to Waze, as reasonable for business
purposes, which may be located in the European Union and the U.S.A., potentially countries outside
of your jurisdiction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waze may also share personal information with companies or organizations connected or affiliated
with Waze, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies (i.e.
entities that belong
to the Google group of companies);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We work with other Google’s services (such as Google Display and Video 360) for advertising and ad
measurement purposes.
In order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Waze, Google, and
websites &amp.
apps that partner with Google, we may share information with these services, such as a
unique identifier for advertising (i.e, Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or
similar technologies).
You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps
that use its services and how you can control that in
this page.
For more information see
section titled ‘Advertising campaigns’ under this Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also work with selected advertising and measurement services which help us understand how our
users interact with ads served in our platform and in order to provide marketing, advertising and
measurement services for Waze with respect to Waze’s own marketing efforts, by using and sharing
devices’ identifiers (i.e, Advertising ID, cookies or similar technologies).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal information may also be shared with Waze’s trusted partners and service providers to
process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other
appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
For example, we use service providers to help
us with customer services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share information which does not personally identify you with third party transportation
services.
For example, to allow you to find a carpool rider on third party transportation services,
such as Moovit, we may share a temporary unique identifier along with pick-up and drop-off points
that are generated based on proximity to your intended travel itinerary, with those third party
transportation services.
You can review the list of the relevant third party transportation services
to your area and change your preferences at any time via the in-app settings.</p>
<p>Waze Carpool partners with employers, organizations and governmental entities (“Waze Carpool
Partners”) in order to encourage the use of carpooling.
If you have joined a Carpool group which is
promoted by a partner or any other third party, your carpool profile (or other information you have
chosen to share) may be visible to other members of the group, including representatives of the
partner or third party who may also be part of the group.</p> Visibility <p>Please note that your username and some other information will be visible to others.
Note that your
username will be included along with any information you submit for posting (such as traffic reports
or chat messages).
It will therefore be visible to others.
Also - your friends on Waze will see your
name &amp.
profile photo and any other information you chose to share with them.</p>
<p>If you prefer to remain invisible on the Waze map, you can set the Waze Application not to show your
location on the map.
To do so you should go to the Privacy Settings and adjust accordingly by
switching on to Invisible Mode.
If on, <strong>some features may not be available</strong>.
If you make this
choice, while you will be ‘invisible’ on the map to other users, your location and route information
will continue to be collected by Waze for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy and your
Carpool profile (if you choose to set one) may be visible to other Waze’s users.</p> Waze Carpool Profile <p>Waze Carpool is uniquely designed to help drivers and riders find a mutual ride that fits them.
If
you have opted-in to use the Waze Carpool feature, you will be required to create a unique profile.</p>
<p>Your Waze Carpool profile includes your name, photo, number of completed rides and carpooled km, the
date you joined the services, information that you have chosen to share from your social account,
your carpool rating and endorsements you have received, and any other information you shared about
yourself (for example your car details or any other information as part of “My Preferences”
settings).
You can edit some of this information through the in-app settings or through your social
account (in case you have chosen to share the information from your social account).</p>
<p>A complete Carpool profile is important so that riders or drivers can learn more about you, and vice
versa.
Your profile is therefore public to other Waze users and may be shared through our services.
If you have joined the Carpool Groups feature, your Carpool profile will be visible to other group
members, including your co-workers or employer in case of work related groups.</p>
<p>If you choose to verify your work or university’s email address, your work or university will be
listed publicly on your profile as well (but your email address will stay private).</p>
<p>Note: your home and work addresses are not listed publicly on your profile, but rather only be saved
on your Waze account.
However, in certain circumstances, your pickup/drop-off spots may be your home
or work address if for example you share a similar route with your driver or rider.</p> Integration with social networks <p>You may choose to share information between your Waze account and your social network account (such
as Facebook).
Through this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content
about you available from social networks, transmitted and shared through the Services.
Similarly,
you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from Waze,
including your location and route information, transmitted to and shared through your social network
account.</p>
<p>By setting your Waze Account to integrate with social networks, including by signing onto Waze by
using your social network account, you agree to share information (including personal information)
between Waze and such social networks, for the purposes provided under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The social network’s use of information made available by Waze is governed by that social network’s
privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Privacy Policy or Waze.</p>
<p>When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise
make the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked by the social network
to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with
Waze.
We collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with the
permissions granted by you (such as your name, email address, list of friends, profile picture and
other information available via the applicable social network).</p>
<p>You understand and agree that the Services may access, make available and store such information so
that it is available on and through your Waze Account, until your Waze Account is deleted.</p>
<p>Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on your third party social
network accounts may become public to other Waze Users through the Services once you have allowed
the social network to share such information with Waze (for example through your Carpool Profile).</p> Integration with other third party services <p>Waze may offer you the option to link Waze to third party services that may be useful to you (like,
Spotify).
Where Waze detects an integration may be available (either because a third party service
attempts to link to Waze, or Waze detects an installed service on the device which has an
integration option, or you request a particular integration), Waze will ask for confirmation to
connect the accounts.
If you choose to connect the accounts, Waze will ask for your permission to
share data with the third party service.
You should only agree to connect accounts if you are
comfortable with the third party service receiving the data set out at the time of connecting the
accounts and Waze is not responsible for the third party service’s use of data.
You can disconnect
Waze and the third party service at any time and Waze will cease sharing data with that service from
the point of disconnection onwards.</p> Controlling your personal information <p>You can always review and update certain information by visiting your Account &amp.
Login settings (such
as your phone, name, photo and more) or the in-app left menu (to update your home, work and
favorites).
If you joined Waze Carpool, you can review and update your information (including this
available on your Waze Carpool profile) through the Waze Carpool in-app settings.</p>
<p>You can log on to the Waze website to view your route history by going to “Edit the Map”/ “Drives”
function on the Waze website.
Note that in order to access certain information you will need to
register your Account.
Your location and route history is associated with your Account.</p>
<p>If you find that the information associated with your Account is not accurate, complete or updated,
then you should make all necessary changes to correct it.
Please keep in mind that false, incorrect,
or outdated information may prevent you from setting up an Account and impair the ability to provide
you with Services.</p> Privacy controls <p>Your in-app Privacy Settings provide you with quick access to settings and tools that let you
safeguard your data and decide how your information can make Waze services work better for you.
For
example, you can control your visibility on the map and manage your preferences about the ads shown
to you on Waze.
If you joined Waze Carpool, you can access more controls through your Carpool
activity and other in-app settings.</p>
<p>There are other ways to control the information Waze collects whether or not you’re signed in to a
Waze Account, including device-level settings: your device may have controls that determine what
information we collect.
For example, you can modify location settings on your device.</p> Deleting your information <p>If you would like us to delete your Account, please use the “Delete Account” function available
under the in-app Privacy Setting and on the Waze website.
On receiving such a request,
Waze will use reasonable efforts to delete such information, however please note that information
may not be deleted immediately from our back-up systems.
We aim to initiate the deletion process
immediately after your request.
Once we receive your request, your data will no longer be used to
personalize your Waze experience.
We then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete
the data from our storage systems.
This process generally takes around 2 months from the time of
deletion.
As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs,
or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and time frames defined in this
policy.
We maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.</p> How Waze retains data we collect <p>Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we
retain for longer periods of time when necessary.
This section describes why we hold onto different
types of data for different periods of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Information retained until you remove it</strong> - such as your “Home, “work”, favorites, email
address and other account related information.
We’ll keep this data in your Waze Account until you
choose to remove it and/or update it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data that expires after a specific period of time</strong> - in some cases, you don’t need to actively
delete your information as we set retention timeframes based on the reason for the data’s
collection.
For example, if you choose to connect your calendar to your Waze Account, we extract
your calendar events for several days in advance and delete them after their occurrence.
We may
also take steps to anonymize certain data within set timeperiods.</li>
<li>
<strong>Information retained until your Waze Account is deleted</strong> - we may keep some data for the life
of your Waze Account if it’s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features
and how we can improve our services.
For example, if you made an incident report, we will keep
information about how many reports you have submitted, even after the event is removed.
When you
delete your Waze Account, the information about how many reports you have submitted is also
removed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes</strong> - sometimes business and
legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended
period of time.
For example, when Waze processes a payment for you, we’ll retain this data for
longer periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes.
Reasons we might retain some
data for extended periods of time include: <ul>
<li>Security, fraud &amp.
abuse prevention</li>
<li>Financial record-keeping</li>
<li>Complying with legal or regulatory requirements</li>
<li>Ensuring the continuity of our services</li>
<li>Direct communications with Waze</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul> How does Waze use aggregated information? <p>Waze may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including anonymous location
information), in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, to properly
operate the Services, to improve the quality of the Services, to enhance your experience, to create
new services and features, including customized services, to change or cancel existing content or
service, and for further internal, commercial and statistical purposes (including advertising).</p>
<p>Waze may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Services, in a
form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating,
transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the
Services, to the Services’ providers, partners and any other third party.
For example, GPS
information that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to map editors in an aggregated
and/or anonymous form to help improve the map and solve map problems, traffic data may be provided
to cities, aggregated use of Waze Carpool may be provided to Carpool Partners and aggregated ads
analysis may be provided to advertisers.</p> Cookies <p>Waze may use cookies and similar technologies on the Services.

<p>The information and advertisements that you see when accessing the Services may be targeted on the
basis of your current Waze activity, such as your current location, your destination or contextual
information based on your current drive session.
For example: if you search for “gas station” you
may see an ad for a local gas station.</p>
<p>Depending on your settings, you may also see <strong>ads personalized</strong> to you based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information we received from you (for example, your saved “Home” &amp.
“Work” addresses)</li>
<li>Past activity and search query history (for example, drives that appear in your drive list)</li>
<li>Information from our ad partners, including entities that belong to the Google group of companies
and other trusted ad partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can decide whether we’ll show you personalized ads or not through your in-app <strong>Privacy
Settings–&gt;Ads personalization</strong>.
Note: turning Ads personalization off does not turn off ads - only
their personalization.</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t knowingly collect nor do we show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such
as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>
<li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or
email, unless you ask us to.
For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the
“tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and share your phone number with the flower shop.</li>
<li>As described under “When Waze shares your information” section above, we work with other Google’s
services (such as Google Doubleclick Bid Manager) for advertising and ad measurement purposes.
In
order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Waze, Google, and websites &amp.
apps that
partner with Google, Waze may share information with these services such as a unique identifier
for advertising (Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or similar technologies).
You
can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how
you can control that in this page.</li>
<li>The Ads personalization control described above apply to personalized ads served by Waze <strong>on the
Waze platform</strong> and they do not apply to ads served on third parties platforms, including on
Waze’s behalf.</li>
<li>When you visit a third party website from the Application, such third party may use cookies on
your computer.
The third party’s use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not
to this Privacy Policy.
If you wish to study the privacy policies of those third parties you
should visit their services, or contact them directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Services includes an internal messaging system which provides you the ability to send and
receive messages to and from other users, and to receive marketing messages from us.
You hereby
agree that we may use the internal messaging system for the purpose of informing you regarding
products or services, which may interest you.</p>
<p>Please note however that other Waze users are not allowed to use your contact details or our
internal messaging account for commercial advertising purposes.
If you have encountered any user
generated advertising material, please inform us through the channels listed on the “About” menu in
the Software or through the “Contact Us” page on the Site link here.</p>
<p>It is clarified that we are not responsible for the content of said advertisements and the products
delivered or services rendered thereby by third parties and you irrevocably and unconditionally
agree that we shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you
may suffer or incur as a result or in connection thereof.</p> Information security <p>Waze considers information security to be a top priority.
Waze services are built with strong
security features that continuously protect your information.
Waze implements systems, applications
and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimize the risk of theft, damage, loss of
information, or unauthorized access or use of information.
For example, we review our information
collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent
unauthorized access to our systems.
In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Waze
employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it.
Anyone with
this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or
terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p>The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security
threats from ever reaching you.</p>
<p>However, these measures are unable to provide absolute assurance.
Therefore, although Waze takes
great efforts to protect your personal information, Waze cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably
expect that Waze’s databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful
interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.</p> Compliance &amp.
