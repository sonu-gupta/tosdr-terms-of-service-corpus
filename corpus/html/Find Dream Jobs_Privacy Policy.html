<p>Our Websites use Cookies to determine whether users have previously visited our Websites and to streamline the registration process.&nbsp.
Although we don’t use Cookies for other purposes, some of our third-party marketing partners may place Cookies on our Websites to track users’ online behavior while on our Website and after they leave our Website.&nbsp.
These third-party Cookies may enable the delivery of interest-based advertisements (to find out more about Cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com) based on a user’s visit to our Website and/or other websites.&nbsp.
In addition, our partners use information gathered in this manner to recognize you across different channels and platforms, including computers, mobile devices, and Smart TVs and may use this information over time for advertising, analytics, attribution and reporting purposes.
For additional information about health-related, political and related custom data segments used for advertising, please click&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>We may use Google Analytics and similar tools provided by our third-party partners to help analyze how users interact with the Website and to display customized ads and other content to our users during a current browsing session or in the future when the user is online.
These analytics are performed by using the technological means described above to monitor a user’s interactions with the Website and do not involve the collection of any additional PII.</p>
<p>Most computers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but users can reset their Internet browsers to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent.&nbsp.
To disable and reject certain Cookies, follow the instructions associated with your Internet browser.&nbsp.
Even where you reject a Cookie, you may still use the Website but your ability to use certain features or offerings may be impaired.&nbsp.

Users may also choose to opt-out of interest-based advertising on their mobile devices.&nbsp.

<p>We may use Information provided by users for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy until a user requests that their Information be modified, deleted or corrected.
All users who provide their Information to us may request that we modify, delete and/or correct their Information by contacting us&nbsp;here&nbsp;(see below for a description of the augmented rights with respect to accessing and deleting Information that are provided to California residents).&nbsp.
We will respond to your request within forty five (45) days.&nbsp.

However, we will retain and may use your Information as necessary to comply with our policies including legal obligations, dispute resolution and enforcement of our agreements.</p>
<p>We ask individual users to identify themselves and the Information requested to be accessed, corrected or deleted (suppressed) before processing such requests and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to process requests that we are unable to verify, are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning Information residing on archive servers).&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>WELLNESS INFORMATION</p>
<p>Our surveys may ask health-related questions which we may share with our third-party marketing partners who advertise health-related products and services on our Websites, or who otherwise promote health-related products or services.
We will use this health information - with your consent - to display offers for health-related products and services or to provide Information to these providers so they can contact you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

If and when we do collect, store and transmit sensitive information, that Information will be&nbsp.
encrypted with advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the nature of the Internet, your Information passes through entities that we are unable to control.&nbsp.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our security measures or those of third parties who access or transmit your Information will prevent your Information from being improperly accessed, stolen or altered.
In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies if we learn of an information security breach of your Information.&nbsp.
You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.&nbsp.

</ul>Exercising Your Rights, Verification and Timing.&nbsp.
To exercise your CCPA rights, click on the “Do
Not Sell My Personal Info” link on the bottom of the Website page where we collect Information, or email us at&nbsp;help@myprivacyrequest.com.&nbsp.
To prevent an unauthorized third party from accessing or making decisions regarding a user’s Information, we verify all requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request).
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or abusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information we already have for the user.&nbsp.
If we cannot verify the user using the foregoing method, we may request additional information which we will not retain or use for any other purpose.&nbsp;<br>For all verifiable consumer requests, we strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt.&nbsp.
If we require additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will provide written notice.&nbsp.
Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt and will be delivered electronically in a secure fashion.&nbsp.
If, for some reason, we cannot fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that decision.&nbsp;<br>Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold.&nbsp.
While users have the right to request different levels of disclosure regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of Information, we have elected to treat all requests from California residents as an exercise of expanded disclosure requests by businesses that sell Information.&nbsp.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you for the 12 months prior to your request:<br>
<ul>
<li>The categories and sources of Information collected;</li>
<li>Our business and commercial purposes for collecting and selling that Information;</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we shared that Information;</li>
<li>The specific pieces of Information collected;</li>

<li>For disclosures - the Information categories for each category disclosed and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was disclosed&nbsp;</li>
</ul>Right to Opt-Out.&nbsp.
Users have the right to opt-out from the sale of their Information.&nbsp.

You can access the form&nbsp;here&nbsp;or you can email us at help@myprivacyrequest.com and elect to opt-out from the sale of your Information.&nbsp.
We reserve the right to verify all opt-out requests using the methods described above.&nbsp;<br>While our agreements with third parties to whom we sell or disclose Information prohibit the further sale or use beyond the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California user’s Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further sell the Information.&nbsp.
We will not ask a California user who has opted out to re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out.&nbsp.
If the user requests a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will inform them that they have opted out and if they want to proceed with the transaction, we will offer the opportunity to opt-in by completing a two-step process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

The following are some of the reasons we may decline your deletion request:&nbsp.
&nbsp;<br>
<ol>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the Information or provide the goods or services you requested;</li>
<li>Detect security incidents, protect, investigate and respond to malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;</li>
<li>Identify and correct errors that negatively impact intended functionality.

As such, unless otherwise permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny,&nbsp.
charge you different prices or rates, or provide a different quality level of&nbsp.
goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, and/or suggest that you may receive a different price, rate, or quality level of goods or services.&nbsp.

behalf to submit disclosure requests and or deletion requests under the CCPA.&nbsp.
