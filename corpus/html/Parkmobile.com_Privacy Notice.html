We will only use your personal information to administer your account, provide the products and services you have requested from us, and to keep you informed about our products and services.
The protection, confidentiality and integrity of your personal data are our prime concerns.
This privacy notice explains what personal information we collect from you when you interact with our products and services, and how we use this information.</p>
<p>We will inform you of any future changes to our processing purposes or our Privacy Policy.</p>Our Services<p>Parkmobile provides a solution to pay for your parking sessions, on-street and off-street, via multiple platforms including phone (Interactive voice response (“IVR”) and SMS), website, and mobile applications.

You provide some of this data directly, for instance when you create an account or enter your parking details into our mobile application.
Additionally, we receive some of your personal data indirectly through your devices, by recording how you interact with our services (e.g.
through cookies).
This allows us to personalise and improve our products.</p>
