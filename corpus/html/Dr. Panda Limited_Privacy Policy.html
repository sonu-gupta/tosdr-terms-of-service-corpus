</p>Dr.
Panda Limited Privacy Policy, last updated 9 October 2021<p> Click here for Privacy Policy in German / Klicken Sie hier für die deutschen Datenschutzbestimmungen</p>
<p>Summary: Dr.
Panda is committed to making sure that kids’ privacy is safeguarded and we aim to comply with all (privacy) regulations worldwide, like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US.If you want to know what data is collected by our apps and how this is handled, please review this policy.
If you have any questions or concerns, send us an email via support@drpanda.com, we are here to help.</p>
<p> When using the apps we produce for parents and children (the “Games”) our company and its subsidiaries (together “Dr.
Panda” or “We”) may collect information including usage data.When adults or parents visit www.drpanda.com (the “Website”), we may also collect information on the usage of our website for adults and parents.
This data collection is discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p>If you are accessing the Games or Website from within the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, please review the Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data and Individual Rights sections below for more information on your how your personal data will be processed and the rights you have regarding this processing.</p>Information collected through our Games<p>Information Collected Automatically By:</p>
<p>Dr.
Panda: Most of our apps note your IP address and use this to determine the country the device is located.
The IP address is not stored on our systems, but we keep track of the country our app is functioning in.
This information cannot be connected to a unique device and is never shared with third parties.</p>
<p>Our QR enabled apps (the “QR App”) require you to scan a QR code to activate the QR App.
The QR code, a regional code (indicating the country the QR App is located) and a random number (generated based on the hardware characteristics of the device the QR App is installed on, but which cannot be used to determine any specifications of this hardware) is forwarded to our servers and stored there.
This information is only used to verify the QR App is only functioning on a limited number of devices at the same time and is not shared outside Dr.
Panda.
If you install the QR App on more devices, the first authorization (based on the random number) will be deleted and this will de-authorize the first device to run the QR App.</p>
<p>Flurry (Yahoo): We used to use this service for analytics, and older versions of our applications may still have the Flurry SDK included in them.
The SDK in those apps has since been made inactive and is no longer collecting any data.
</p>Mixpanel: We use Mixpanel in some of our apps services to get a better understanding of the usage of our apps.
To this end our apps collect non-personal data which is sent to Mixpanel and only used to provide us with an overview of the usage of our apps.
The information collected by us through Mixpanel is used solely to improve our service and we do not provide this information to any other third party, unless in order to comply with a legal obligation to do so (e.g.
court order) or in case the ownership of the information changes due to a merger, acquisition or restructuring involving Dr.
Panda Limited.<p>
</p>
<p>For more information on Mixpanel please see their privacy policy here: https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy </p>
<p>Firebase is an attribution tool that lets us know which sites, apps or platforms users of some of our apps may come from.
This specific tool is only used in relation to adult users of our apps or sections of our apps targeted at adults (such as subscription purchase areas).</p>

It collects analytical information to better understand your use of our Games and to improve them for you.
Unity does not share any personal information with other third parties.
Unity will use the collected information only in anonymized form for their own products.</p>
<p>For more information on Unity please see the privacy policy here: http://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy, and for more information on the exact data collected you can refer to the appendix below.</p>
<p>Sensorsdata: We use Sensorsdata in some of our apps to get a better understanding of the usage of our apps.
To this end, our apps use Sensorsdata to collect data which is collected, sent to and stored on our own servers only.
If a user is logged in with a Dr.
Panda Account, we may link certain app usage information collected by Sensorsdata, such as which activities have been completed by a user, so we can inform parents of their child’s progress and usage in an app.
Other information collected by us through Sensorsdata is used solely to improve our service and we do not provide this information to any other third party, unless in order to comply with a legal obligation to do so (e.g.
court order) or in case the ownership of the information changes due to a merger, acquisition or restructuring involving Dr.
Panda Limited.</p>

We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe.
If our full response will ever take more than a month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you of this and keep you updated.</p>
<p>Review and update your data: You have the right to access and update any personal data that we have collected.

<p>After you delete your personal data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim.</p>
<p>Restrict Processing: You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances.
This is an alternative to requesting the deletion of your data.
Rather than requesting we delete all your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes.

This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request.
Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation.
Even after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.</p>
<p>If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request.
If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies.
If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.</p>
