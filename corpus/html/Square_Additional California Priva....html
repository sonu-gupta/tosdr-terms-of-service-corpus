</p>Additional California Privacy DisclosureWhat You Need to Know About the California Consumer Privacy Act and Internet-Based Advertising <p>As described in our privacy notice, Square and third parties that provide advertising or other functionality on our behalf, may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technology to help us advertise our products and services to you as informed by your interests.
This approach is called interest-based advertising, which means we tailor our ads to you based on information that gives us a sense of what interests you, such as information collected from your activity on the web, including but not limited to, browsing or purchasing products on or through our websites or on third party websites, your activity on mobile sites and applications, or your responses to our marketing emails.</p>
<p>Square does not sell your data, has not in the past, and is committed not to do so in the future.
While the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) lacks clear guidance whether this type of interest-based advertising would be considered a “sale” of personal information under that law, we do not believe this information constitutes a “sale” under CCPA.</p>
<p>However, we also want to provide you with ways for you to control the cookies and internet-based information you may share with us.
You can always restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by going to your browser settings.
