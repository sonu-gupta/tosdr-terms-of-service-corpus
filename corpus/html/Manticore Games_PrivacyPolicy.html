TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p>We collect two basic types of information – personal information and anonymous information – and we may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information, aggregate information.
Personal Information means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s first and last name, postal address, email address and/or telephone number.
Anonymous Information means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual (including an individual’s computing device).
Aggregate Information means information about groups or categories of individuals which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual.
We may share Aggregate and Anonymous Information with other parties without restriction.</p>
<p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration information you provide when you create an account, which may include personal data such as:&nbsp;your first name and surname, country of residence, date of birth, email address, username and password.</li>
<li>Transaction information you provide when you request information or purchase a product or service from us, whether on our sites or through our applications, including identification information, your date of birth, your postal and/or residential address, telephone number and payment information.
If you conduct transactions, we may collect and retain some or all of the information related to these transactions, including transaction amount(s), parties involved, time and manner of exchange, and other transaction circumstances, such as payment method and names or emails of external third-party accounts.</li>
<li>Information you provide in public forums on our Service.
Please note that our sites and applications may offer chat, forums, community environments (including multiplayer gameplay) or other tools that do not have a restricted audience.
If you provide Personal Information when you use any of these features, that Personal Information may be publicly posted and otherwise disclosed without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party.
We do not require our users to include sensitive data (e.g., race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, sexual life or criminal record) in their account.
If you choose to post any such data to your account or public forums on our Service, please understand that it is visible to others as noted above.
We have no obligation to keep private any sensitive information or personally identifiable information that you have made available to other users or the public using these functions.

&nbsp.
HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>We collect information you provide directly to us when you request products, services or information from us, register with us, participate in public forums or other activities on our sites and applications, respond to customer inquiries or surveys, or otherwise interact with us.
We also record some of this information automatically when you use our Services.
&nbsp;We also may receive some of this information from third parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect the types of information as outlined in Section 1 and when you visit our sites or applications, when you register and manage your account, when you use our Services, when you purchase a product or services from us, when you post to public forums or chats, if you send us support inquiries, intellectual property claims or other claims, complaints or inquiries, when you participate in contests or promotions, or when we ask you for information for contractual or legal reasons.</li>
<li>We collect information through technology, such as cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons and pixel tags), including when you visit our sites and applications or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms.
A cookie is a small string of data which often includes an anonymous unique identifier sent to your Internet browser from a website’s computers, which is stored on your computer’s hard drive and is used to customize your use of a product or online site, keep records of your access to an online site or product, or store information needed by you on a regular basis (e.g.
password retention functionality).
Manticore (itself or through third parties acting on our behalf) uses cookies for a number of purposes relating to our websites, applications and services, including to access your account information where you “login” to our websites, forums or other areas and to keep track of your website session data.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.

Please note that if you reject all cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our (or other companies’) web pages.</li>

These companies may set and use cookies, web beacons, pixels and other technologies to collect anonymous information about your visits to our Service, and may otherwise aggregate, analyze and anonymize that data.&nbsp;We may permit these companies to collect information from site visitors about their online activities over time and across other websites.&nbsp;If you would like to learn more about these specialized advertising technologies, the Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;offers useful information about Internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out&nbsp;of certain information collection.

Local law may require that you authorize the third party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that when you provide information to us on a third-party site or platform (for example, through our applications), the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform.
The information we collect is covered by this Privacy Policy and the information that the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices.
Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our applications.</p>

<p>If you are based in the European Economic Area, under certain circumstances you have the following rights: </p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal information.
You may have the right to request access to any personal information we hold about you as well as related information, including the purposes for processing the personal information, the recipients or categories of recipients with whom the personal information has been shared, where possible, the period for which the personal information will be stored, the source of the personal information, and the existence of any automated decision making.</li>

</p>
<p>For residents of the European Economic Area, where processing of personal data is based on consent, Manticore will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.
