<p> Lawyer and bar-certified specialist in information technology law<br> Dr.

General information on data processing 1.
Scope of personal data processing <p> In general, we record only the personal data which you disclose when using Services as part of your login or registration and possibly during use of fee-based services.
Personal data are those which contain information about personal or factual circumstances.
When logging in and registering as a user on our website, you only have to provide an email address and, if applicable, a username and password.
When registering for certain Services, email addresses are not collected during registration but only later during the use of the Service.
The password is stored in hasehd form, which never allows for an inference of the actual password.
</p>
<p> In the context of implementing the concluded user contract, particularly in the context of fee-based Services you have chosen, the disclosure of further data, such as the full name, address, account details, credit card numbers, etc., may be required.
It is sometimes also necessary to request personal information such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number for the purposes of processing your inquiries or providing you with support.
InnoGames will handle these data confidentially and in compliance with the legal data protection provisions.
In principle, InnoGames will not disclose such information to third parties without your permission, unless this is required for the implementation and execution of the contract, for processing your request or for your support or in the case of a legal permit.
</p> 2.
Legal basis for personal data processing <p> Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, Art.
6(1)(a) of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for personal data processing.
</p>
<p> In personal data processing required for the fulfilment of a contract of which the data subject is a party, Art.
6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
This also applies to the processing required in order to carry out pre-contractual actions.
</p>
<p> Insofar as personal data processing is required for the fulfilment of a legal obligation which our company is subject to, Art.
6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
</p>
<p> In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require personal data processing, Art.
6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
</p>
<p> If processing is required to protect the legitimate interests of our company or of a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the interests mentioned first, Art.
6(1)(f) serves as the legal basis for processing.
</p> 3.
Deletion of data and duration of storage <p> The personal data of the data subject are deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer exists.
In addition, such storage may occur if this is provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject.
The blocking or deletion of data also occurs when the storage period prescribed in the abovementioned regulations lapses, unless further storage of the data is required for conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.
</p> 4.
Data security <p> InnoGames makes reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorised access to your personal data as well as unauthorised use or falsification of these data and to minimise the corresponding risks.
However, the provision of personal data, whether it be in person, over the phone or over the Internet, always involves risks and no technological system is completely free of the possibility of being manipulated or sabotaged.
</p>
<p> InnoGames processes the information collected from you in accordance with German and European data protection law.
All employees are obliged to comply with data secrecy and data protection provisions and are instructed in this regard.
Your data are transmitted in an en-crypted form using the SSL method.

For this purpose, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.

<p> The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the Services.
In addition, the data is used by us in order to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
Evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.
Only a statistical evaluation of datasets takes place.
</p>
<p> InnoGames reserves the right to store IP addresses and log files for a maximum period of 30 days after the website is used to monitor compliance with the terms of use and rules of the game.
In particular, this procedure is used to prevent any cases of abuse or to resolve them and, on a case-by-case basis, to pass on the data for this purpose to investigative authorities.
Apart from that, any other analysis of data is done in anonymous form as much as possible.
After the end of this period, the IP address and log files are completely deleted, unless there are mandatory statutory storage requirements or specific prosecution- and abuse investigation proceedings pending.
</p>
<p> These purposes also constitute our legitimate and predominant interest in data processing according to Art.
6(1)(f) GDPR.
</p> 4.
Storage duration <p> The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to fulfil the purpose of their collection.
In the case when data are collected for the purpose of making the website availa-ble, this is the case when the respective session is over.
</p>
<p> Log files which contain personal data are generally deleted after seven days at the latest.
Ad-ditional storage is possible in the case of so-called error logs which allow us to fix errors.
These error logs are deleted after maximum 30 days, collected IP addresses are anonymised after 30 days.
</p> 5.
Possibility of objection and removal <p> The collection of data for the purpose of making the website available and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website.

General information <p> The website may occasionally contain advertisements from third parties and interactive links to third-party websites for which we are not responsible.
In particular, we have no influence whatsoever on the content and design of the external sites linked to the websites to which you may be directed via these sites.
The respective providers are exclusively responsible for the content and design of these websites as well as compliance with data protection regulations.
Advertisers occasionally use technologies that send advertisements that appear on our websites directly to your browser, automatically transmitting your IP address.
The advertisers concerned sometimes also use cookies and other technical means to measure the efficiency of their advertising or to optimise their content.
This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to the classification of websites to certain interest categories within the scope of your Internet use.
No connection will be established between this information and your name, address, telephone number or email address.
We have no influence on that.
The handling of data by these third parties is therefore not covered by this data protection declaration.
Therefore, please contact the respective provider directly for information on their data protection regulations.
You can disable the use of cookies in your browser settings (see above).
</p>
<p> We forward your anonymised Device ID (IDentifier For Advertisers - IDFA or Google Advertiser ID - GAID) to some of our marketing partners within and outside of Europe (e.g.
in the USA), in order to generate advertising for certain user groups with the help of our partners or to exclude users from certain advertising efforts.

California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA or, if you are an EU resident, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”).
</p>
<p> The Facebook pixel is a code snippet placed on our website.
</p>
<p> Facebook Pixel allows Facebook to identify the visitors of our online content as a target group for displaying advertisement (known as “Facebook ads”).
Accordingly, we use Facebook Pixel to display our posted Facebook ads only to Facebook users who have shown an interest in our services or who share certain factors (such as interests in certain topics or products determined on the basis of visited web pages), which we transmit to Facebook (which is known as Custom Audiences).
Facebook Pixel also helps us understand the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, by showing whether users have been redirected to our services after clicking on a Facebook ad (known as conversion, and allowing to determine on which devices a user is performing an action), in order to create so-called lookalike audiences or statistical twins (i.e.
to broadcast ads to target groups that are similar to existing customers) and to obtain comprehensive statistics about the use of the website.
Facebook Pixel establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers when you visit our website.
This way, the Facebook server is notified that you have visited our website and Facebook assigns this information to your personal Facebook user account.
</p>
<p> Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and therefore offers a guarantee of compliance with European data protection laws: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active.
