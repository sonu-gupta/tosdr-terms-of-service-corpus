In addition, when using certain features of the Service, you may also be subject to the guidelines, terms and agreements applicable to such features (“Policies”).
All such Policies are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.
If these Terms of Service are inconsistent with any Policy, the terms in the Policy will control.<br>
We may periodically make changes to these Terms of Service and the prices of the various aspects of the Service.
We will notify registered users of the Service by email of any material changes to these Terms of Service and Service pricing, so please keep your registered email address current.<br>
Please read the Terms of Service carefully.
By downloading, installing or using the Software, or accessing or using the Service, you accept the Terms of Service and any modifications that may be made to the Terms or Service pricing at any time.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to any provisions of these Terms of Service, you should not access or use the Service or download, install or use the Software.
If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Service.</p>
<strong>Term of&nbsp;Service</strong>
<strong>Initial Term</strong>
<p>Service is provided on paid subscriptions only for a term of one month if you choose the monthly plan, or one year if you choose the annual plan (the “Term”).
The initial Term begins on the date that you subscribe to the Service.
You are subscribing to the Service for the full length of the applicable Term.
This means that if you terminate the Service prior to the end of the then-current Term or we terminate the Service as a result of your Default (any reason, including without limitation, for your failure to pay any sum due hereunder, for suspected fraud or other illicit activity, and/or for any other breach of these Terms of Service – each, a “Default”), you will be responsible for any applicable charges for the full Term as if you remained a customer through the end of the then-current Term, including, without limitation, outstanding charges and unbilled charges.
In addition, you will not be entitled to a refund for any unused portion of prepaid Term charges.
You may switch to a lower or higher cost plan at any time.
In the event you make such a switch during a Term, you immediately will be credited or billed a prorated amount of the difference between your previous plan fee and that associated with your new plan based on the amount of time left in the current Term.
The credited amount can be used for payment in future periods, or for any add-ons, but will not be reimbursed in cash.</p>
<strong>Renewal</strong>
<p>The Term for all Service plans will renew automatically for successive Terms of the same length without further action by or notice to you.</p>
<strong>Termination</strong>
<p>You may terminate the Service or your account by calling MightyCall at +1 (888) 256-8312 during working hours (8 am to 8 pm EST) 7 days a week.
Upon receiving verification of your account, we will terminate the Service or your account.</p>
<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, suspend or terminate the Service or your account without notice as a result of your Default.
We reserve the right to determine, in our sole discretion, what constitutes a Default and you agree that our determination is final and binding on you.
In the event of a Default, you will pay us all outstanding charges and unbilled charges and will reimburse us for all attorney, court, collection and other fees and costs we incur in the enforcement of our rights under these Terms of Service.
Upon termination of your account, we will delete all information stored in your account (including voicemails, recorded calls, text messages, calls history) within 30 calendar days unless you request transfer of the information before the end of that period, in which case, once you have paid all outstanding debts on your account, we will use reasonable efforts to provide the information to you in electronic format at your expense.
Business phone numbers acquired with the MightyCall service and ported into MightyCall will be automatically released and lost after 7 (seven) calendar days of the account subscription being terminated either by your request or by non-payment.</p>
<p>If you transfer or port a Number or Ported Number (as defined in Section 3.3) to another service provider, you must notify MightyCall about requesting a port out by calling MightyCall at +1 (888) 256-8312 during working hours (8 am to 8 pm EST) 7 days a week.
You remain responsible for paying for the Service till the port is completed.
MightyCall does not charge porting-in fees.

MightyCall reserves the right to add, modify or amend the Fair Use Policy at any time for any reason in its sole discretion.</p>
<strong>Phone Numbers</strong>
<p>We will provide telephone numbers to be used in connection with the Service or you may port a number to MightyCall for use within the Service (each, a “Number”).

We will not be liable for reimbursement for business cards, stationary, or press releases under any conditions if we are not able to give you a requested number.</p>
<p>A request by you to port your Number from MightyCall to another provider may be deemed a request by you to terminate your account with us.

In addition, you acknowledge that the Numbers you obtain from us may not be listed in any telephone directory (except for Numbers ported to us from your local phone company, which may be listed).
One of the consequences of this is that a reverse directory lookup of your Number will most likely not reveal your address.</p>
