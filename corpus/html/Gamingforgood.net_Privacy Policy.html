<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p> Clash of Streamers and GamingForGood.net are developed and maintained by an informal collective of volunteer contributors, known as ‘The Singularity Group’, who focus their efforts on a wide range of projects from charity fundraising to net neutrality activism.
The Service doesn't sell data or act as a middleman for your donations nor for charity donations.
In all legal, commercial and administrative regards, GamingForGood.net, Clash of Streamers and their games and apps (collectively herein referred to as the Service or Services) are published, owned and represented by the European company, The Naughty Cult Ltd., and for the purposes of applicable EU data protection law (including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 aka GDPR), we are a 'data controller' of your personal information.
"We", "us" or "GamingForGood" will, in this Privacy Policy, collectively refer to The Naughty Cult Ltd.
</p>
<p> We take privacy and security very seriously and always try to go the extra mile to make sure that your data is protected and that we don't collect or store any information from you that is not relevant to our services.
And since we want to be transparent about how we process your information, we are providing detailed insight into when and why we collect your personal information, how we use it, the limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure.
</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p> Cookies are small data files which are placed on your device as you browse this website.
They are used to 'remember' when your computer or device accesses our websites.
We use cookies to remember a few settings and details that allow us to make things more convenient for you.
You may set your browser to block cookies but this may disable some of the website's functionality.
</p>
<p>Here's what our cookies do:</p>
<p>
</p> - If you logged in ('connected') using Twitch or another service such as Facebook or YouTube on our GamingForGood.net or ClashOfStreamers.com website, some session/account data is stored to let you use our Dashboard and make donations using the name or nickname provided by the third party service you logged in with.
- Google Analytics and other analytics trackers may store some information to help give us an overview of visitor statistics (more information on this below).
- Cloudfront, which helps speed up page-loading and protect our website against DDoS-attacks, may store some information that allows them to decide whether or not to grant you access to our pages.
<p>
</p>
<p> When someone visits GamingForGood.net, we may use Google Analytics and other analytics methods and services to collect standard Internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns.
We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the sites.
This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone.
We do not make, and do not allow third party analytics services to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.
</p>
<p>Your Account</p>
<p> Instead of letting users make an account with an e-mail or username and password, our Service simply lets users connect with an existing account from an integrated social platform such as Twitch, Facebook and YouTube.
As a result, we don't receive or keep account passwords on our servers.
But since our GamingForGood.net Dashboard and donation pages as well as various Clash of Streamers in-game features allow you to interact with these external social platforms in many ways, we may explicitly request access to a range of aspects of your existing third party service account when you choose to connector log in.
Depending on the use-case (whether you connect through the website or the Clash of Streamers game for example), this list may include features that we might never actually use but are nevertheless listed due to the fact that the service in question (eg.
Twitch) bundles certain features along with the ones we need.
The full list is presented when you authorize connecting with your preferred service and may include but is not limited to: </p>
<p>
</p> - Your email address - A list of all subscribers to your channel - Ability to log into chat and send messages - View your paid subscriptions - Check if a user is subscribed to your channel - Manage your followed channels - Update your channel's title, game, status, and other metadata - Cut VODs <p>
</p>
<p> Only if you choose to 'Authorize' this request, which lists all the details upon connecting, do we get access to any of this information and functionality.
You can completely revoke our access at any time from the Connections tab of the Twitch.tv Settings page or similar settings pages on the other services.
</p>
<p> After connecting with your account, the following data may be stored on our servers: </p> - Your Dashboard preferences - Your email address (so that we can email you confirmation when you make a donation) - Third party platform account information such as but not limited to Twitch, YouTube, Facebook or Discord account information that is required for us to connect your game or Dashboard preferences to you and/or enable people to donate to you on your GamingForGood.net stream page - Basic session logging details such as IP's and timestamps so that we can track and prevent potential abuse - Incoming and outgoing donation details that are relevant for displaying on your Dashboard and stream page and to track and prevent potential abuse - Avatars, nicknames and/or emotes publicly displayed by your third party service account (for representation or display on-site or in-game) <p>Clash of Streamers</p>
<p> Our mobile game, Clash of Streamers, which is part of our overall Service, features stylized representations of emotes and avatars from streamers who use GamingForGood.net and will encourage players to visit the streams associated with them.
We give streamers full control over how and whether they are represented or referred to and on the Dashboard offer the option to add, change or remove references or appearances from the game.
</p>
<p>Data that you provide to us in-game:</p> - Contact information (such as name and email address) - Profile information, including player avatars created by using the in-game camera feature and/or uploading images.
Note: the in-game camera uses Banuba's SDK (please read their privacy policy here http://banubafilters.com/privacy-policy/).
Banuba uses Apple's TrueDepth API to create AR effects within the app.
None of the information collected by the TrueDepth API ever leaves the user's device.

- Advertising and integrated social media platforms: our Services include features from platforms such as Unity and Unity Ads, which have their own privacy policy that we encourage you to read.
In addition, you may choose to use our integration of for example Reddit, Twitch, YouTube, Discord or Facebook, in which case we also encourage you to check their Terms and Privacy Policies (click the links to read these) to learn more about their data processing practices.
An example of this is how Clash of Streamers uses the YouTube API Services to allow players to livestream.
This means that YouTube and Google's Privacy Policy applies.
