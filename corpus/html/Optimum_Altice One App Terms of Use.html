</i> Altice One App Terms of Use CSC Holdings, LLC ("Altice") provides the Altice One application (the "App" or "Altice One App") which, among other features, allows Subscribers to access their Optimum TV service via an authorized mobile device, including but not limited to select Apple and Android devices (collectively, "Device(s)").
Access to and use of the App is subject to the following Terms of Use (the "Terms") as well as the Agreement for Optimum TV, the Customer Privacy Notice and the Mobile Application Privacy Notice, as such may be amended from time to time (collectively, the "TOS"), which are incorporated herein by reference.
Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the TOS.
By downloading, installing and/or using the App, Subscriber agrees to be bound by these Terms, which constitute an agreement between Subscriber and Altice.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Features and Functions.</strong>
<br>
The App makes available for viewing in Subscriber's residence, through a Device, the channels and other content offerings which are authorized by Subscriber's service level and account status and only such channels and content offerings, subject to the availability (as a result of technical and other considerations) of such channels and content offerings through the App.
The App also allows Subscribers to use their Device as a remote control and control the Altice One or Altice One Mini.
The App also allows Subscribers to search for programming and other content using either voice-based or text-based search.
Subscriber understands and agrees that the audio files and associated transcriptions and log files ("Speech Data") generated by Subscriber's use of the voice-based search will be collected, stored, and used by Altice and its vendors to translate the Speech Data into text and may be collected and used by such third parties to tune, develop, build, enhance and/or improve the speech recognition functionality.
Subscriber also understands and agrees that the text-based search terms generated by Subscriber's use of text-based search as well as the transcription(s) of Subscriber's voice-based search will also be collected, stored and used by Altice and its vendors to provide Subscriber with search results and recommendations of related programming or content, including for the purpose of developing, enhancing and/or improving the search and recommendation functionalities.
<br>
<br>
The App also enables Subscribers that subscribe to Optimum TV and/or Optimum Online to manage their Optimum TV DVRs remotely through their Device.
Use of the Optimum TV DVR through the App is subject to the Agreement for Web DVR.<br>
<br>
Subscriber understands and agrees that Altice reserves the right to modify the App, and the features and functionality thereof, at any time without notice to Subscriber.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Restrictions on Use.</strong>
<br>
Subscriber agrees that his/her use of and access to the App shall only be for personal and noncommercial use and not for public use or performances.
Subscriber understands and agrees that only certain content is accessible from the App when outside of the service location.
Subscriber agrees that s/he shall not access or use any software, system, device or other technology to enable the App or any feature or functionality thereof to be accessed or used in any manner or for any other purpose other than as expressly permitted hereunder.
For example, Subscriber may not view the App through a virtual private network.
Other features of the App, including channel guide, Search, and management of their Optimum TV DVR, subject to the Agreement for Web DVR, may be available outside of his/her residence.
In order to access the App, Subscribers also agree to password-protect their home router to ensure the security of their in-home wireless network.
(This is in addition to the fact that the underlying television signals delivered from Altice's headend are themselves encrypted all the way to the Device.) No more than three (3) Devices associated with a Subscriber's account may simultaneously view channels and content offerings through the App.
A Subscriber may not use Airplay to transfer any audio and/or video content viewed through the App to any other device inside such Subscriber's home.
Subscriber also agrees not to submit any automated or recorded requests for Voice Search purposes.
<br>

<br>
Altice shall have sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in and to the App, all copies thereof, all derivatives thereof, and all modifications and enhancements thereto (including ownership of all copyrights and other intellectual property rights pertaining thereto).
These Terms do not provide Subscriber with title or ownership of the App, but only a right of limited use.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Limitations on Use.</strong>
<br>
Subscriber may not decompile, reverse engineer, translate, disassemble, modify, port, translate, copy, reproduce, duplicate, distribute, create derivative works of the App or in any way derive, reconstruct, identify or discover from the App any source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms by any means.
Subscriber also agrees not to sell, lease, license, sublicense, distribute, assign, transfer or otherwise grant any rights to the App.
Subscriber agrees not to remove, alter, or obscure any product identification, proprietary, copyright, or other intellectual property notices, labels or marks contained or embedded within or on the App.
