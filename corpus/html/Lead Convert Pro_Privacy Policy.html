<p>In this section we summarize the categories of personal information that we've collected, disclosed or sold and the purposes thereof.

<p>We collect the above mentioned categories of personal information, either directly or indirectly, from you when you use leadconvertpro.com.</p>
<p>For example, you directly provide your personal information when you submit requests via any forms on leadconvertpro.com.
You also provide personal information indirectly when you navigate leadconvertpro.com, as personal information about you is automatically observed and collected.

<p>We may disclose the personal information we collect about you to a third party for business purposes.
In this case, we enter a written agreement with such third party that requires the recipient to both keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose(s) other than those necessary for the performance of the agreement.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties when you explicitly ask or authorize us to do so, in order to provide you with our Service.</p>
<p>To find out more about the purposes of processing, please refer to the relevant section of this document.</p> Sale of your personal information

<p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins and the like.</p> Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information
<p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.
This means that whenever you request us to stop selling your data, we will abide by your request.<br>Such requests can be made freely, at any time, without submitting any verifiable request, simply by following the instructions below.</p> Instructions to opt out of the sale of personal information

In such cases, your personal information will be processed in a fashion necessary and proportionate to the business purpose for which it was collected, and strictly within the limits of compatible operational purposes.</p>
<p>We may also use your personal information for other reasons such as for commercial purposes (as indicated within the section “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document), as well as for complying with the law and defending our rights before the competent authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or we suffer an actual damage.</p>

<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on leadconvertpro.com, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>
<p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.</p> How to exercise your rights

<ul>
<li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
<li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>
<p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.</p>

<p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.</p>
<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
