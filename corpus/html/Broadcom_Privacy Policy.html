<p>
<strong>Processing Of Personal Data For The Purposes Of Fraud Prevention And Network and Information Security</strong>
<br>On the basis of legitimate interest, we process Personal Data for fraud prevention and network and information security purposes.
Pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of preventing fraud and ensuring network and information security.
According to the GDPR, network and information security means the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of payment security services and cybersecurity technologies and services, it is in our legitimate interests as well as in our customers’, to collect and process Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of preventing “Fraudulent Payment Transactions” and ensuring the security of our own, and of our customers’ payment transactions and information networks and systems.
This includes the development of payment transaction records and of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis our ability to detect Fraudulent Payment Transactions, and the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events affecting information networks and systems (“Cyber-Threats”).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Personal Data we process for the prevention of Fraudulent Payment Transactions include, without limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information related to electronic means of payment and related entitlements;</li>
<li>Information related to electronic payment transactions;</li>
<li>Contextual signals and indicators of suspected fraud;</li>
<li>Verification information to confirm or dispel suspected fraud.
and</li>
<li>Evidence of suspected, detected and/or confirmed fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Personal Data we process for network and information security purposes include, without limitation, network traffic data related to Cyber-Threats such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);</li>
<li>recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks);</li>
<li>reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);</li>
<li>filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to emails);</li>
<li>URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents).
and/or</li>
<li>IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of Cyber-Threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any other data subjects.
However, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting and mitigating the Fraudulent Payment Transaction or Cyber-Threat of concern to you, and to all organizations relying on our products and services to secure their payment transactions, and information networks and systems.
When processing Personal Data in this context, we will only seek to identify data subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>to the extent that it is an inherent part to the services that our customers hire us to perform for them, and as such it is strictly indispensable to the prevention of the fraud and/or the remediation of the Cyber-Threat concerned, or</li>
<li>if and as required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you believe that your Personal Data was unduly collected or is unduly processed by Broadcom for such purposes, please refer to the “Your Rights” and “Contact Us” sections below.
Please be aware that if it is determined that Personal Data concerning you is processed by Broadcom because it is critical for the prevention of Fraudulent Payment Transactions, or the detection, blocking or mitigation of Cyber-Threats, then in certain cases the legitimate interest to pursue such processing may be compelling enough to override access, objection, rectification or erasure requests related to the data concerned.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Automated Individual Decision-Making And Profiling</strong>
<br>Where Broadcom processes payment transaction security or network traffic data for the purpose of fraud prevention, respectively network and information security, automated decisions concerning particular payment transactions or cyber events may occasionally be made.
This could involve in particular assigning relative payment fraud risk, respectively cybersecurity risk scores to ongoing or recent payment transactions, information network activities or system behaviors.
Such automatically-assigned risk scores may be leveraged by you, by Broadcom, by our partners and by other customers to detect, block and mitigate the detected Fraudulent Payment Transaction or Cyber-Threat.
They could therefore result in said partners and customers blocking payment transactions they deem to be fraudulent, halting network traffic coming from or going to suspected or known malicious addresses.
Such processing is not intended to produce any other effect than protecting you, Broadcom, our partners and our other customers from fraudulent payment transactions, respectively Cyber-Threats.
Should you nevertheless consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact directly the relevant data controller whose use of our products and services is thus impacting you.
In case that data controller is Broadcom, please refer to the “Your Privacy Rights” and “Contact Us” sections of this Policy to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.</p>

<strong>Processing Of Pseudonymous Data To Improve the Performance of Broadcom Hardware</strong>
<strong>
<br>
</strong>Certain mobile devices equipped with a Broadcom GPS chip occasionally require querying Broadcom's geolocation assistance server.
At the user’s request when launching a geolocation service on their device, the chip will transmit to Broadcom over TCP/IP the device's then-current broad city-level location.
In response, the server will designate to the chip the then-relevant satellites to connect to.
This service reduces the time needed for the chip to achieve accurate GPS location from about 15 minutes to less than 1 minute.
Broadcom does not manually access, inspect, disclose, retain, correlate or reuse any of the data associated with this service.
The logs related to this service only contain the dynamic IP address from which the device connected to the service, and these logs are purged on a rolling 24-hour basis.
Broadcom is not in a position to identify any individual end-user based on the information involved in this service.</p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>

California law provides that you have the right to submit a request to Broadcom at its designated address and receive the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The categories of information Broadcom disclosed to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year;</li>
<li>The names and addresses of third parties that received such information.

Broadcom in the United States and service providers comply with applicable legal requirements providing for adequate protection of Personal Data transferred to countries outside of the EEA, the UK and Switzerland.</p>
