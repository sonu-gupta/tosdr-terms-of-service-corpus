<em>Review Previous Policy</em>

<p>Your privacy is important to Garmin.
We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we process your personal data when you create a Garmin account, interact with our customer support specialists, make a purchase in one of our stores, visit Garmin.com or other Garmin websites, or use Garmin apps that include a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Other Garmin websites, apps, and products that include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy.
For example, we have a separate privacy policy that applies to Garmin Connect and its compatible wearables and other devices.

</ul> Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:
<p>When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password.
You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.</p>
<blockquote>
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
<p>(a) Garmin processes your email address and password because you use your email address and password to sign in to your account.
The legal ground for processing your email address and password for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.</p>
<p>(b) Garmin also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy.
The name you provide is associated with your account profile and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a Garmin website or app or engage with other Garmin users.
The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other Garmin users.</p>
<p>(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from Garmin, Garmin will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about Garmin products, services, and apps, as well as newsletters.
The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent.
You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your preferences in your Garmin account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails.
The marketing emails you receive from Garmin are based on the preferences you provide in your Garmin account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your Garmin account, and any subscriptions included in your Garmin account.
The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.</p>
<p>(d) Garmin also processes your email address to associate it with your Garmin account when you interact with our customer support representatives.
The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.</p>
<p>(e) Garmin also processes your email address to notify customers when they have violated our terms.
The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in ensuring a quality experience for all customers and ensuring adherence to our terms.</p>
</blockquote>
Personal data that is processed when you sync your Garmin device:
<p>When you sync your Garmin device through Garmin Express, we log data about the transmission, such as the IP address used when syncing, the sync time and date, crash/diagnostic logs, geographic location of the device, information about your device, information about the network used to sync (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular), and device battery level.</p>
<blockquote>
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
<p>We process this information to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues.
The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in resolving errors or syncing issues and providing quality product support.</p>
</blockquote>
Personal data that is processed when you communicate with Garmin:
<p>When you interact with our customer support representatives by email or telephone, online, or in person, we collect personal data, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences, and information about the Garmin products you own, such as their serial numbers and dates of purchase, and subscriptions you've purchased.
We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues and capture information relating to the support or service issue.
To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys.
With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your Garmin account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.</p>
<blockquote>
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
<p>We use this information to provide you with customer and product support, to monitor the quality and types of customer and product support we provide to our customers, and to facilitate repairs, returns, or exchanges.
The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing quality product support.
The legal ground for signing in to your Garmin account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue is your consent, which you may withdraw.</p>
</blockquote>
Personal data that is processed when you use your Garmin auto navigation device or app:
<p>If you use a Garmin auto navigation device or app and provide your consent, then Garmin will collect and upload from your device data such as location, speed, direction, and time and date of recording.
If you provide your consent when asked, then Garmin may also share this aggregated data with third parties to enhance the quality of the traffic, parking, and other features enabled by content providers.</p>
<blockquote>
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
<p>This data is aggregated with data from other consenting users and is used to enhance the quality of our products, services, and apps and the traffic, parking, and other features enabled by Garmin or third parties.
The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is your consent, which you may withdraw at any time within the settings of your Garmin device or app.</p>
</blockquote>
Personal data that is processed when you purchase a product, service, or subscription on a Garmin website or app or through customer support:
<p>If you purchase a product, service, or subscription on a Garmin website or app or through customer support, then Garmin will collect your name, address, email address, and telephone number.
We do not view or store your payment card information.
Third-party payment processors are used depending on region and product purchased.
These payment processors include Adyen, PayPal, Alipay (China only), WeChat Pay powered by tenpay (China only), UnionPay (China only), NewebPay, Klarna, and Veritrans.
More information about Adyen can be found here.
We also use Cybersource, a solution provided by Visa, in our fraud detection processes, and we use address verification services provided by third parties such as Google or CDYNE.</p>
<p>In some regions, another third party, Narvar, provides shipment information to allow you to track items purchased from a Garmin website or purchased, repaired, or exchanged through customer support.</p>
<blockquote>
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
<p>We collect your name, mailing address, and telephone number so we can process your order and fulfill your purchase.
The legal ground for processing your name, mailing address, and telephone number for these purposes is performance of a contract.

<p>When you purchase a product in a Garmin store, we may collect your name, address, telephone number, other contact information, or purchase details, such as invoice number or products purchased.
In some countries, third-party providers may be used to generate the reporting required for the appropriate tax regulatory agency.</p>
<blockquote>
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
<p>We process this information to generate an invoice in our systems for tax reporting purposes or upon your request.
The legal ground for processing your information for generation of an invoice for tax reporting purposes is fulfillment of a legal obligation.
The legal ground for processing your information for generation of an invoice at your request is performance of a contract.</p>
</blockquote>
Personal data that is processed when you use location-based services on your Garmin device or app:
<p>If you choose to use location-based services, such as weather, traffic information, fuel prices, movie times, and local event information, on your Garmin app or device, then the physical location of your device will be collected in order for Garmin or our providers to provide you with such location-based services.</p>
<blockquote>
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
<p>The purpose of processing the location of your device is to provide you the location-based services you wish to use.
The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is performance of a contract.</p>
</blockquote> Categories of Recipients of Personal Data YOUR LIVETRACK INVITEES:
<p>LiveTrack is a feature available on some Garmin devices that enables you to send a link to people of your choice that allows them to see the real-time location of your device.
Because anyone with access to the link will be able to see the real-time location of your Garmin device, you should use caution in determining to whom you want to send the link and be sure that you trust them to not send the link to others whom you do not want to be able to view the location of your Garmin device.</p>
OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS:
<p>Garmin uses cloud services from third parties such as Adobe and SendGrid, a Twilio service, to assist in sending emails.
Those services track the activities associated with these emails, such as whether they were opened, whether links in the emails were clicked on, and whether purchases were made following clicks on those links.
Garmin uses this data to analyze the level of engagement with its emails.
Garmin also uses third-party service providers to help us better understand usage of Garmin Express and Garmin websites and apps and for related purposes.</p>
<p>Garmin uses third-party service providers to ship purchased products to customers.
In some regions, Garmin uses a third party, Erply, to provide point-of-sale services for in-store purchases and another third party, Global Blue, to provide tax rebate paperwork for customers upon request.
Garmin also uses a third-party service provider, VHT, to provide callback request functionality for customer support purposes.</p>
OTHER DISCLOSURES:

(c) to enforce any of our terms and conditions or policies.
or (d) as necessary to pursue available legal remedies or defend legal claims.</p>
<p>We may also transfer your personal data to an affiliate, a subsidiary, or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of Garmin’s business, assets, or stock, including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding, provided that any such entity that we transfer personal data to will not be permitted to process your personal data other than as described in this Privacy Policy without providing you notice and, if required by applicable laws, obtaining your consent.</p> Transfers of Personal Data <p>Garmin is a global business.
