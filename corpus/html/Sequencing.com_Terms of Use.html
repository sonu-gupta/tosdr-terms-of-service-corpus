<p>
<strong>4.
<u>Considerations Regarding the Services</u>
</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.1.
Nature of Information.</strong> Company does not guarantee that any information we provide to you regarding your Genetic Data and/or Phenotypic Information will be positive or welcome.
In fact, such information may be negative and unwelcome.
You may learn things that you may not have the ability to control or change.
You may learn things that are deeply distressing.
These outcomes may have psychological, social, legal, or financial implications.
You should also understand that as research advances you might need to obtain further services in order to utilize such information.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.2.
The Services Do Not Constitute Medical Advice.</strong> The Genetic Information provided by Company through its Services, which include without limitation the Site, Company’s Apps, and third party Apps, including those hosted by Company or elsewhere, is purely for research, informational, and educational use only.
The Services are not intended to diagnose an illness, condition, or disease, and are not a substitute for professional medical advice.
You should always seek the advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.
Company does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the effectiveness of any specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on the Site.
If Company provides you with information based on your Genetic Data and/or Phenotypic Information this information is intended only for informational purposes and discussion with your physician or other healthcare provider.
Do not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of information from Company.&nbsp.
For most common diseases, the genes we know of are only responsible for a small fraction of the risk.
Other predictors include unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle choices.
If your data indicate that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected.
The opposite is also true.
if your data indicate you are at an elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively develop the disease or condition.
In either case, if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through Company, you should contact your physician or other health care provider.
Only a trained physician or other health care provider can assess your current state of health or disease, taking into account many factors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current symptoms, if any.
Reliance on any information provided by Company, Company employees, others appearing on our website at the invitation of Company, or other visitors to our website is solely at your own risk.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.3.
Laboratory Processing and Errors.</strong> Company is not a laboratory, nor does it perform genetic testing.
Company has no control over the validity or accuracy of your genetic testing results and the related genetic data files that the lab produces.
As this possibility is known in advance, users are not entitled to refunds when invalid or inaccurate genetic testing results occur.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.4.
Sharing Genetic Information.
</strong>The Site allows you to share your Genetic Data files and any related outputs from Apps with other Users.
Any such sharing that you undertake is solely in your discretion and at your own risk.
You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Data with others.
Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies request Genetic Data, but this could change in the future.
While current state and federal law provide protection against discrimination by employers and health insurance companies the exact contours of such protection has not been clearly established.
In addition, current federal and state law does not apply to life or disability insurance providers.
You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your Genetic Data before you share it with anybody.
For non-Membership accounts, the Site allows you to designate one or more of your Genetic Data files as an “Altruist File.” All Genetic Data in a designated Altruist File is deidentified and made available to other Users as part of Company’s “Altruist Database”.
Your Genetic Data will never be shared with anyone or added to the Altruist Database unless you specifically provide permission for such sharing.
Please note that any Genetic Data shared prior to your decision to unshare your Genetic Data cannot be undone.
however, following your decision to unshare your Genetic Data, no further Users or other persons will be allowed to view your Genetic Data.
For Membership accounts, all Genetic Data stored in a Membership account is Altruist Data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
<u>Customer Accounts, Passwords, and Security</u>.</strong> In consideration of your use of the Services, you agree to provide and regularly update, as applicable, true, accurate, current, and complete Registration Information.
Upon registering an account, you will be prompted to create a password and account designation.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.
If you allow third parties to access Company's website through your username and password, you will defend and indemnify Company and its affiliates against any liability, costs, or damages, including attorney fees, arising out of claims or suits by such third parties based upon or relating to such access and use.
You agree to immediately notify Company of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and to ensure that you sign out of your account at the end of each session.
