<strong>Cookie Matching / UID Matching</strong>

<strong>Data matching and lookalike audience building</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We allow partners to reach audiences on our platforms via data matching where they have appropriate permissions.
We use your UID to carry out such data matching.
This is conducted at an aggregate level or an individual level, depending on how targeted our partners want to reach audiences on our platforms.
The data overlap between our audiences and the client is useful to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the matching process, we segment audiences based on predefined attributes.
These audiences may be similar to our partners’ existing audiences and are therefore called “lookalike audiences”.
For example, a female fashion brand may want to reach “women interested in fashion”.
This helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising.</p>

<p>We use advertising to fund some of our websites and apps.
Some advertising is ‘contextual’ meaning it is shown due to the particular webpage you are presently viewing.
Other advertising, known as “online behavioural advertising” is shown to you based upon your likely interests, which are inferred from your browsing history.
This information is collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies or your UID.
For more information on controlling your tailored advertising preferences, please see Section 14 on Cookies below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we allow advertisers to show advertisements directly on our website and apps, which are tailored to you based upon information they have obtained, such as your browsing history on their own websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other times we shall arrange for our customers to be shown advertisements on our own or other websites or apps.
These advertisements are tailored to you with information we have obtained from your browsing on our websites and apps via cookies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we arrange for our customers to be shown advertisements, we use technological and contractual mechanisms to protect your cookie data and to ensure that your browsing data used for advertising is not used by advertisers or other website owners for other purposes, such as linking online behavioural advertising data with your contact details, unless you have provided the advertiser or other website with your express permission to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are shown an advertisement, our advertising systems do not know who you are or your contact details (such as your name, email address or postal address).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demographic information from your registration on our websites and apps (such as your age, gender and city) may also be used, in connection with our legitimate interests to tailor the advertising we arrange to be shown.
Your demographic information is not shared with advertisers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use our websites and apps or interact with our emails, we may collect information using cookies or similar technologies.
We may also collect information using your email address.
For the purposes of this section, we use the word “<strong>cookies</strong>” for simplicity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>What are cookies and how do they work?</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies are small files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you.
This allows websites to tailor what you see on the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you use other technologies which are similar to cookies?</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, we use the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Web beacons:</strong> Our websites, apps and emails often contain small invisible images known as “<strong>web beacons</strong>” or “<strong>tracking pixels</strong>”.
These are used in a way similar to cookies to:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>understand when a particular part of a webpage, email or app is viewed;</li>
<li>understand how successful an article or an email marketing campaign has been.
and</li>
<li>verify any clicks through to links or advertisements contained in emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Flash cookies:</strong> In certain situation we use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video clips.
Local Shared Objects (flash cookies) are used to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tracking URLs:</strong> These are web links that allows us to measure when a link is clicked on.
They help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising and the popularity of articles that are read.</li>
<li>
<strong>Device identifiers:</strong> We use device identifiers on mobile devices in the same way as cookies are used on web browsers.
A device identifier is a unique number on your device which allow us to remember your device.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use these similar technologies on websites, emails and apps, for the same purposes and in much the same way as we use cookies on websites.
We shall use “<strong>cookies</strong>” and “<strong>websites</strong>” below as shorthand for “cookies and similar technologies” on “websites, emails and in apps”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you use cookies for?</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies and other online tracking technologies are an important part of the internet.
They make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
