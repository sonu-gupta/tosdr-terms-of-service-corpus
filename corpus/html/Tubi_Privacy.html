<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>.
Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer’s Internet browser.
Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform.
For example, cookies can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited.
They enable us to make your use of the Tubi Services more enjoyable.</p>
<ul>
<li>We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may display targeted advertisements based on your activities and other information collected from or about you, such as your interests and your activities online.
Cookies are one way that this kind of information is stored.</li>
<li>We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use cookies and similar technologies to compile aggregate data about you and to relate your use of the Tubi Services to information obtained from you or from reputable third parties.
For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, data about your activities on the Tubi Services, collected using cookies, may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we believe will be of interest to you.</li>
<li>You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, if you reject certain cookies, you will not have access to certain features of the Tubi Services.</li>

<p>
<strong>Other local storage</strong>.
We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “<strong>Flash cookies</strong>”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Tubi Services, including the video player.
Sometimes called “browser cookies,” these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings.
However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies.
Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.

California residents also have the right to submit a request for deletion of information under certain circumstances, and to opt out of the sale of their personal information.</p>
<p>This notice describes those rights, including the method through which you may submit a request to exercise those rights, and provides the disclosures regarding personal information required by the CCPA.</p>
<p>
<strong>What are my rights?</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the CCPA you are granted certain rights with respect to your personal information.
These rights are not absolute, are subject to exceptions, and we may be required or permitted by law to decline your request.
Only you as a resident of the State of California, a person that you authorize to act on your behalf, or an entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may exercise these rights.
We are permitted to reject your request if we reasonably do not believe you are a resident of the State of California.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
Access categories of information.</strong>
</p>
<p>The following table describes the categories of personal information we have collected for all users over the past 12 months, the source of collection, our purpose for using it, and the categories of third parties with whom we disclose for a business purpose or sell.
Depending on the California resident’s interactions with us, we may not have disclosed PI collected about that resident for each of these purposes.</p>Categories of PI collectedSources of PIPurposes of use of PICategories of third parties to whom we disclose the PI for a business purposeCategories of third parties to whom we sell the PIAlphanumeric Identifiers, such as device ID and IP addressYou, your browser, computer, or deviceProvide and improve the Tubi Services.

<strong>4.
Opt-out of the sale of personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>The CCPA defines “sale” in a very broad way.
Because of this, it is unclear under the law as to whether certain disclosures of personal information constitute a sale.
The Tubi Service uses advertising to provide you with a free service.
The use of targeted behavioral advertising, which is one type of advertising Tubi uses, may constitute a sale under the definition.
If you wish to cease receiving targeted behavioral advertising on your devices, please see the section titled “Opting Out of Third Party Behavioral Advertising” in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
To do so, please make a request through the form at https://tubitv.com/privacy/opt-out.</p>
<p>
<strong>Nondiscrimination.</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the CCPA, we cannot discriminate against you because you elect to exercise one of your rights respecting your personal information, such as your right to delete.
If you do elect to delete your personal information you will be treated as a new viewer and will no longer have access to your existing queue, watch list, or personalized recommendations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Verifying requests.
California residency requirement.</strong>
</p>
<p>The rights described in this privacy notice, including the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information, are limited to residents of the State of California.
We may require additional information from you to verify that you are a California resident, or may reject your request if you cannot provide it.
We reserve the right to require additional proof of your identity and California residency, including government identification and/or a utility bill.
We further reserve the right to reject requests that we reasonably believe are from non-California residents, or are fraudulent, excessive, or burdensome.</p>
<p>You may designate, in writing, through a power of attorney, or through registration with the California Secretary of Statement, an authorized agent to make requests to exercise your rights on your behalf.
We will require the agent to provide proof that they are authorized to act on your behalf.</p>
