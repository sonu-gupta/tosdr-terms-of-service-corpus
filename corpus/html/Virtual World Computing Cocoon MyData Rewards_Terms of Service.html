<p>These Terms of Service apply to the executable code version of Cocoon</p>
<p>Cocoon is aimed at providing the best rewards program (“Service”).
As such, it’s worth noting a few major items:</p>
<p>By creating a Cocoon account or Logging In, you acknowledge and agree to Cocoon collecting information on the apps installed on any device the software is installed on.
This information may be used to ensure that Cocoon is able to promote relevant apps and offers.</p>
<p>Members are not permitted to attempt “gaming” or “hacking” the Cocoon program in any way.</p>
<p>Members will not, under any circumstances, encourage other members or any other persons to hack or game the Cocoon program including via online blogs, forums, groups, etc.</p>
<p>Members will not post referral links in an attempt to trick members or any other persons through deceptive means, inaccurate descriptions, fake earning opportunities or other questionable methods as determined by the Cocoon staff.</p>
<p>Cocoon at its sole discretion will and can cancel or remove your account or suspend your account entirely if Cocoon has reasons to believe that rewards were earned through means that are against the Cocoon Terms &amp.
Conditions as well as the spirit of the guidelines.
Examples of abuse that Cocoon’s automated technology will flag and will not be tolerated include: extended inactivity, software that attempts to manipulate the program in any way, and app usage anomalies outside of normal behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Violating any of these terms or any of the terms below will mean immediate revocation of earned rewards and potentially means being blacklisted from Cocoon in perpetuity.</p>
<p>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (“AGREEMENT”) GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE.</p>
<p>Cocoon is pleased to provide and maintain our product (the ” Software”).
Except as otherwise indicated by Cocoon, the Software includes the Cocoon mobile apps, tablet apps and any other versions of our product and any updates, new versions or new releases of the product.
Cocoon’s software also includes the desktop web browser for Windows and Macintosh.</p>
<p>Cocoon’s browser is built on the Chromium Open Source project.
More about Chromium and the copyrights and conditions can be learned about here: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/LICENSE</p>
<strong>Your relationship with Cocoon</strong>
<p>Your use of Cocoon’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Cocoon under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Cocoon.
“Cocoon” refers to Virtual World Computing, whose principal place of business is at 5425 Hollister Ave, Ste 160, Santa Barbara, CA 93111, United States.
This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Cocoon, your agreement with Cocoon will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document.
These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.
Open source software licenses for Cocoon browser source code constitute separate written agreements.
To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Universal Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement with Cocoon for the use of Cocoon browser or specific included components of Cocoon.</p>
<p>Your agreement with Cocoon will also include the terms set forth below in the Cocoon browser Additional Terms of Service and terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms.
All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”.
Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.</p>
<p>The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Cocoon in relation to your use of the Services.
It is important that you take the time to read them carefully.
Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.</p>
<p>If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</p>
<strong>Accepting the Terms</strong>
<p>In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms.
You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.<br>
<strong>You can accept the Terms by:</strong>
</p>
<p>(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Cocoon in the user interface for any Service.
or</p>
<p>(B) by actually using the Services.
In this case, you understand and agree that Cocoon will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>
<strong>Language of the Terms</strong>
<p>Where Cocoon has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Cocoon.</p>
<p>If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.</p>
<strong>Provision of the Services by Cocoon</strong>
<p>Cocoon has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”).
Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Cocoon itself.
You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.</p>
<p>Cocoon is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users.
You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Cocoon provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.</p>

You may stop using the Services at any time.
You do not need to specifically inform Cocoon when you stop using the Services.</p>

<p>You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).</p>

<p>In order to ensure the availability and quality of our service for all of our users, by accessing our service, you agree that your device and/or software does not disturb or interfere with our service, including our mobile apps, our tablet apps, or our website.
If we suspect that any equipment or software is causing interference with our service, we reserve the right to immediately disconnect that equipment or software from our service, and we reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate your further use of our service.

You indicate your acceptance of this Agreement by clicking on the “I Agree” button (if one appears), or simply by downloading, installing or using the Software.
By doing any of these actions you have indicated that you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms.
If you are accepting the terms of this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the terms of this Agreement, and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.
If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, you must have the agreement of your parent/legal guardian to this Agreement on your behalf.
If you do not accept all the terms of this Agreement, then Cocoon is unwilling to license the Software to you, and you may not use it, and you must immediately remove the Software from any computers or devices upon which you have downloaded or installed it.</p>

or</p>
<p>we are required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of our Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful).
or</p>
<p>any partner with whom we offered the Services to you has terminated its relationship with us or ceased to offer their services to you.
or</p>
<p>we are transitioning to no longer providing the Services to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.
or</p>
<p>the provision of the Services to you is, in our opinion, no longer commercially viable.</p>
<p>at any reason, whatsoever.
or if you have broken any of the terms in the Agreement herein.</p>
<p>You further agree that your use of the Services shall be lawful and that you will comply with the usage rules.
In furtherance of the foregoing, and as an example and not as a limitation, you agree not to use the Service in order to (all as determined in our sole and absolute discretion):</p>

<p>defame, libel, ridicule, mock, stalk, threaten, harass, intimidate or abuse anyone, hatefully, racially, ethnically or, in a reasonable person’s view, an otherwise offensive or objectionable manner</p>
<p>upload or transmit (or attempt to upload or transmit) files that contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancel bots, corrupted files or data, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of the Service, other users’ computers, or the access to or functionality of the Cocoon services</p>
<p>violate the contractual, personal, intellectual property or other rights of any party including using, uploading, transmitting, distributing, or otherwise making available any information made available through the Service in any manner that infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other right of any party (including rights of privacy or publicity)</p>
<p>attempt to obtain passwords or other private information from other members</p>
<p>improperly use support channels or complaint buttons to make false reports to Cocoon</p>

<strong>Notification with respect to Children’s Privacy (Users under the age of 13)</strong>
</p>
<p>In response to concerns about protecting children’s privacy online, Congress enacted the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13.
In accordance with the Company policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:</p>
<p>Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age.
or</p>
<p>Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties;</p>
<p>We request that children under the age of 13 not submit any Personal Information to us via Cocoon services.
It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13.
If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers.
All points or tokens earned by a member who is later identified as being in violation of these terms will be removed from the account.
Questions regarding children’s privacy should be directed to: https://trycocoon.com/contact/</p>
