<strong>General:</strong> Bitpanda maintains social media presence on different platforms (see below) in order to communicate with its active Clients, prospective Clients and interested social media users about Bitpanda’s services, products and other news.
When you access such social media platforms, the general terms and conditions, as well as the privacy policies of these operators, additionally apply.
We would like to point out that user data may also be processed outside the European Union.
This can result in risks for users due to different legal frameworks (e.g.
it could make it more difficult to enforce data subject rights).

<p>As part of the technical process of different social media platforms (e.g.
Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), these platforms will know when you click on content or a website you are visiting, if you are logged in to your social media account at the same time.
Such information is collected by social media platforms and assigned to your social media accounts, regardless of whether you click on content of this platform or not.
By logging out from your accounts, you can prevent such companies from associating the information collected with your accounts.
The activities of those companies are not controlled by Bitpanda and therefore, we do not assume any liability for damages that you may incur through the use of your data by these companies.
For more information regarding tracking, cookies and similar technologies as well as opt-out possibilities, have a look at our Cookie Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Controller:</strong> Bitpanda can only process personal data of social media users if they communicate directly with Bitpanda via such platforms (e.g.
number of visitors, posted articles, likes, direct messages, Client inquiries, comments, etc.).
In such cases, Bitpanda is also responsible for the processing of personal data gathered thereby.
In addition to the data processing by us, other providers, in particular operators of social networks and platforms, also process personal user data.
We have no influence on this data processing and are not responsible for it - the data processing takes place exclusively in the area of responsibility of the other providers.

In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights regarding data processing by other providers, we point out that these can be asserted with the below-mentioned providers.

Newsletter:</strong>
<p>
<strong>What’s the legal basis for electronic notifications and how to unsubscribe?</strong>
</p>
<p>In our email newsletter (e.g.
coin-update), we inform you about Bitpanda’s services and products.
If you would like to receive our newsletter, you have to subscribe with your email address.
We send newsletters and other electronic notifications only with your expressly consent if you’ve subscribed for it (double opt-in) or which is recorded during registration for a Bitpanda account, or where there is a legal basis to do so (e.g.
Art.
107 para 3 of the Austrian Telecommunications Act [TKG]).
With the double opt-in procedure, we check whether you are the holder of the email address given or if its holder agrees with receiving electronic notifications.
This procedure serves as proof in case a third party misuses an email address through registering to receive the newsletter without the knowledge of the entitled party.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>Our Newsletter is performed by UAB MailerLite (J.
Basanavičiaus 15, LT-03108 Vilnius, Lithuania) and in the newsletter so-called web beacons (also called ClearGIFs or tracking pixels) might be used.
Such web beacons provide us with a better understanding of our Clients' interactions with the newsletter.
They fulfil a similar function as cookies, but they are not visible to users.
Information can be obtained via web beacons, in particular about whether an email was opened and whether the user’s system is capable of receiving HTML emails.
</p>
<p>You may unsubscribe from our newsletter, e.g.
by withdrawing your consent, at any time.
You can unsubscribe when you are logged into your account and furthermore you will find a link to unsubscribe at the end of each notification.
Please note that we will continue to process your personal data until you withdraw your consent to the storage of the data, so that we can prove consent previously given to receive newsletters.
The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defence against claims and you shall have the right to request the deletion of your personal data.
</p>
<strong>13.
Retention and deletion periods:</strong>
<p>
<strong>For how long is my personal data processed (stored) and when will it be deleted?</strong>
</p>
<p>We retain your personal data, as far as necessary, for the duration of the entire business relationship (from initiation through performance to termination of a contract), and in principal 1 year after termination of the business relationship.
Beyond this we retain your data only for a longer period, in accordance with statutory retention and documentation obligations, to defend legal claims or with your explicit consent.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>The retention period is thus determined by the statutory retention periods or limitation periods.
In accordance with the Austrian Enterprise Code (UGB) and the Federal Tax Code (BAO) 7 years, in accordance with the Financial Market Money Laundering Act (FM-GWG) 10 years, in accordance with the Equal Treatment Act (GIBG) half a year, and in certain cases between 3 and 30 years according to the Austrian General Civil Code (ABGB) e.g.
if data is required as evidence for legal disputes or for as long as there are other legitimate interests in retention.
</p>
<p>Unless expressly stated in this Privacy Policy, personal data processed by us shall be erased as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and the erasure does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>erasure of the personal data is required for compliance with a legal obligation under European Union or Member State law to which the Controller is subject.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Requests for the erasure of personal data must include the respective ground (Art 17 para 1 GDPR).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to restriction of processing:</strong>
</p>
<p>You shall have the right to request from us the restriction of processing where one of the following conditions applies: </p>
<ul>

<p>you contest the accuracy of the personal data (the restriction shall be put in place for a period which enables Bitpanda to verify the accuracy of the personal data).

or </p>
</li>
<li>

</p>
<p>You shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning you which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
You shall also have the right to request that we transfer these data directly to another controller, designated by you, where this is technically feasible and does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
The right to data portability may only be exercised where the basis of the processing is either your consent or a (pre)contractual necessity, and where the processing is carried out by automated means.
The right to data portability does not apply to processing which is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to object:</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time if the processing is based on our legitimate interests.
If you have objected to processing, we shall no longer process your personal data, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or unless the processing is for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.
The objection does not affect the lawfulness of processing your personal data based on legitimate interests before your withdrawal.
</p>
