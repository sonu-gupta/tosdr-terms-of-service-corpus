<p>LAST UPDATED April 23, 2019</p> Brave Websites, Forums, and Email Privacy Policy <p>Read this document to understand how Brave Software (“us”, “we”, “Brave”, etc.) use data to operate its websites, forums, and communications.
To learn how we use data for the Brave Browser, see the Brave Browser Privacy Policy.
To learn how we use data for publishers and creators, see the Publisher Privacy Policy.</p> Infrastructure <i>
</i>
<p>Brave websites are hosted on infrastructure we operate, and on infrastructure operated on our behalf by Amazon, Heroku (a Salesforce company), and Fastly.
Fastly’s infrastructure is designed to be as close to you as possible — probably in the same country as you, though this is not guaranteed.
The rest of this infrastructure is located in the United States, which is where information is processed and stored.
Amazon, Heroku, and Fastly are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which provides safeguards intended to be equivalent to those provided in the EU.
See data processing details.</p> Community forums <i>
</i>
<p>Co and forum.batcommunity.org are forums on which you may post and publicly communicate with other Brave users and community-members.
Brave runs these forums, and they are hosted on its behalf by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit.
Their privacy policy describes how they use your data to host the forum for us.
The IP address of all server requests are stored for no more than 30 days.
We have access to the information that you make available on the forum, and can use this to administer the forum.
Information about how Discourse keeps your data safe is available here.
All of Discourse’s code is open source and subject to public inspection.
If you are a user you can access or delete your account (and related data) in the “preferences” panel at co.
You can also contact us to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
See data processing details.</p> Advertising Brave to people using Facebook, Google, and Twitter <i>
</i>
<p>Brave uses Facebook, Google, and Twitter ads to attract new users.
Brave does not track people on Facebook, Google, or Twitter, or use any kind of in-app or Brave-server post-install tracking.
See data processing detail.
These ads link to pages on a separate website run by a company called Unbounce on Brave’s behalf, on servers based in the EU.
See data processing details.</p> Children <i>

<p>Children under the age of 13<sup>1</sup> are not permitted to use the website, sign up for email updates, join the community forum, or send Brave any other information.
