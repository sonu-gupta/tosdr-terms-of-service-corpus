Advertising at GMX 5.1 Advertising on the GMX Online Portal <p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p> 5.1.1 Purpose of Processing and Legal Basis <p>In order to continue to provide our services to you <b>free of charge</b>, we display advertisements.
We strive to show you only ads that match your interests.
<br>
<br>
By targeting advertising that is as interest-based as possible, we try to display content that matches your preferences.
In doing so, we primarily present you with advertisements of our own products or products made available through partnerships.
In addition, other companies can also book advertising space on our GMX online portal.
These bookings financially support the operation of our free product world for you.
<br>
<br>
In order to guarantee a <b>pleasant and intuitive user experience</b>, on our online portal we analyze typical comings and goings of our visitors and the structure of user groups, albeit only on the pseudonymous level.
This pseudonymization is a measure to protect the privacy of our users.
Information is not stored in plain text and in relation to a specific person, but only as a random identifier consisting of letters and numbers.
This helps us avoid showing you online ads too frequently in a certain period of time, for example.
For this reason, we allocate a user ID that shows us that someone has already seen this ad often.
this is the only way we can control this for you.
We do not combine these pseudonymous user profiles with your personal data.
therefore, we do not know who you are.
We use them exclusively to optimize the user experience.
The legal basis of this data processing is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.
<br>
<br>
We process the pseudonymized usage data that is generated when using our services on a legal basis in order to improve the user experience on our online portals.
In addition, we work together with other partners (third-party providers) in order to be able to display the greatest variety of relevant online advertising outside our online portals.
These may also be used as a basis for targeting of interest-based advertising.
You can find a list of the most important partners in the Permission Management under Our Partners.
<br>
<br>
All information collected in connection with advertising on our online portal about the user – and the associated pseudonymized profile formation – is subject to the highest security standards.
This information is often stored in cookies.
Cookies are small text files stored by your browser and they ensure that a website “remembers” you.
This allows websites to load faster on your next visit or usage data to be stored.
To find out how you can object to this storage of usage data, see 5.1.3 Configuration Options.</p> 5.1.2 Categories and Origin of Personal Data <p>In connection with <b>advertising on our GMX internet portal</b> we only process pseudonymized <b>usage data</b>.

This includes, for example, click behavior in the GMX portal or the use of other services such as cloud storage and other usage data if you have a GMX account.
We collect this data via the device that you use to navigate our portal.
If you have a GMX account, we also process <b>file data</b>.
