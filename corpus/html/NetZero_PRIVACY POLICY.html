This Policy applies to the Sites and Services only.
When you visit websites to which we link, or if you click on third party advertisements that appear on our Sites, you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policies.
For example, a third party website will have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and web beacons or collection of your information.
In addition, you may choose to use services and products offered by third parties through our Services or devices such as third party applications.
Your use of such services and applications may result in these third parties collecting your personal information and obtaining information from NetZero, including location information (when applicable).
You may also choose to give personal information directly to third parties when using such services.
In each case, personal information you give a third party will be subject to its terms, conditions, and policies-not this policy.
You should review a third party's privacy policy and terms of service before providing your information or using the service.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other website or application from which you request products or services.
You can access and update most of your basic account information by visiting your account page.
Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information.
</p>

<br>
<b>C.
Information we receive from third parties: </b>
<br>
<br> We may collect information about you from other sources, including publicly available sources, our Affiliates or our third party partners such as Advertisers (as defined in Section III below), service providers or others, in order to update or supplement information we have collected directly from you.
An "<b>Affiliate</b>" is a company that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with NetZero.
If information is collected in this manner it will be displayed in your My Account page for review, editing or deletion.
<br>
<br>
<b>D.
Information collected through technological methods:</b>
<br>
<br> In addition, we may use, and may allow our Affiliates or third party partners to use, technological methods such as cookies or web beacons to collect information about you.
<br>
<br>
Cookies are small pieces of data that may be stored on your computer, mobile device, or other similar device and are used to make the Sites easier to use and to improve effectiveness of advertising.
For example, cookies keep track of your preferences, what Sites or other websites you visit, any personalization you may have done, any passwords you have elected to be remembered, and they may also measure whether you've seen or interacted with an advertisement on our Sites or other sites.
Cookies (or similar technological methods) also allow us, our Affiliates and our third party partners to serve you with advertisements including targeted advertisements when you are on or off the Sites.
Cookies may be set on your browser when you visit our Sites, or when you open emails from us.
<br>
<br>
Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movement of users.
Web beacons help us and our third party partners better manage content delivery by informing us when you are on our Sites and what content is effective.
We also use web beacons in our emails to let us know which emails you have opened.
<br>
<br>
NetZero does not currently take action as to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not been developed.
<br>
<br>
Please see Sections II and III of this Policy to see how we use, share and disclose information collected through technological methods.
<br>
<br>
<b>E.
Retention of Information:</b>

<br>
<p>III.
Targeted Advertising, Email &amp.
Opt-Outs</p>
<b>A.
Targeted Advertising Opt-Outs:</b>
<br>
<br>
We may display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites based on information we obtain from you, about you, and/or from third parties.
<br>
<br> We work with advertisers, agencies, and other companies that connect advertisers to the Internet (collectively, "<b>Advertisers</b>") in order to display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites.
These advertisements are targeted based on information that we or third parties may have collected about you such as demographic information (gender, age, general geographic location, etc.) as well as behavioral information.
Behavioral information is information about your preferences that is collected or inferred based on, among other things, online data such as the URLs or websites you visit and searches you perform, and offline data such as your purchases and subscriptions.
Information shared with Advertisers is pseudonymized prior to transfer.
<br>
<br>
We and our Advertisers may use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize advertising content.
for example, web beacons may enable us or our Advertisers to recognize your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email.
In addition, a unique third party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email.
<br>
<br>
You may opt out of targeted advertising from many Advertisers by exercising your choice here.
Please note that although you may opt out of targeted advertising, you may continue to see advertisements.
these advertisements may not, however, be as relevant to you as targeted advertisements.
<br>
<br>
If you choose to opt out of receiving targeted advertising, please note that the opt-out tools accessed here are specific to the browser and computer, mobile device or other similar device you are using at the time you opt out.
Your opt-out choice cannot be honored if you access our Sites using a different browser on this computer, mobile device or other similar device, or if you access our Sites from a different device.
Also, since the opt-out tools involve placing a special cookie on your browser, your opt-out choice cannot be honored if all cookies on your device(s) are deleted.
As a result, you should repeat this opt-out process with each browser and device you use to access the Sites and Services and whenever cookies are deleted from your device(s).
NetZero has no control over any opt-out tool offered by others and cannot guarantee the performance of such tools.
<br>
<br>
Instead of using the cookie-based opt-out tools described above, you may also choose to not allow cookies to be stored on your computer, mobile device, or other similar device by modifying your web browser settings.
Each browser is different, so make sure to check each browser's user guide to learn how to change your cookie preferences for each browser.
If you choose to reject cookies, however, you may not be able to automatically access products and services offered by us that require a user "login" or "sign in." In addition, any cookie-based opt-out tools may not be implemented on your device.
<br>
<br>
Please see Section I.D.
of this Policy for more information on technological methods of data collection such as cookies and web beacons.
<br>
<br>
<b>B.
Email Opt-Outs:</b>
<br>
<br>
You may receive email advertisements and promotions from us, our Affiliates and our Advertisers regarding products or services we believe you may be interested in, new features or products we are introducing, or other promotions.
If you decide that you wish to cease receiving such email, you may do so at any time by following the opt-out instructions in the email.
<br>
<br>
Since it is necessary for us to contact you regarding certain matters, you may not opt out of receiving messages related to material company announcements or policy changes, or administrative matters relating to your account, like billing, collections, customer service or similar matters.
<br>
<br>
If you subscribe to a free or discounted version of a Service, you acknowledge that as a condition of receiving such free or discounted Service, you are required to receive information and advertising solicitations from third party Advertisers.
You may opt out of receiving individual communications from each Advertiser by following the instructions provided by the Advertiser.
These solicitations are a condition of receiving the free or discounted Service and you agree that if you opt out of receiving these solicitations you are required to terminate the relevant Service.
<br>
<br>
<p>IV.
How We Keep Your Information Secure</p> We use secure socket layer ("<b>SSL</b>") technology to protection your information.
SSL encrypts your order information as additional protection against the decoding of that information by anyone other than us.
However, despite all reasonable security precautions and processes, such as password protection, encryption technology, and use of firewall technology, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect all information we collect and process, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Sites, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission, we will take commercially reasonable precautions to protect its security on our systems.
<br>
<br>
<p>V.
Minors' Use of the Services</p>
NetZero believes it is important for parents and guardians to participate in and monitor their children's use of the Internet.
NetZero offers general audience Sites and Services and these Sites and Services are not intended for children under the age of 13.
If we have actual knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we require the parent or guardian to provide parental consent as required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("<b>COPPA</b>").
NetZero will not use or disclose PII from children under 13 except as may be permitted under COPPA.
