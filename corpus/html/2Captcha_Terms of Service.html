<strong>1.
Definitions</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2Captcha (“2Captcha” or the “Service”) is a manual CAPTCHA solving service provided<br>
through the URL www.2captcha.com (the “Website”) which allows you to solve CAPTCHAs<br>
for research purposes.
2Captcha is owned and operated by Khivrin N.N., a sole proprietorship<br> (“2Captcha”, “we”, “us”).
2Captcha has employees, independent contractors, and<br>
representatives ("our Team").
As a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity<br>
that’s a customer of the Service, you're a “Member” according to this agreement (it’s “you”).<br>
These Terms of Use (“Terms,” along with our our API Guidelines) define the terms and conditions<br>
under which you’re allowed to use 2Captcha and how we’ll treat your account while you’re a<br>
Member.
