The General Terms and Service Specific Terms are collectively referred to as the “Terms”.
In the event of a conflict between the General Terms and Service Specific Terms, the Service Specific Terms shall prevail.</p>Acceptance of the Terms<p>You must be of legal age to enter into a binding agreement in order to accept the Terms.
If you do not agree to the General Terms, do not use any of our Services.
If you agree to the General Terms and do not agree to any Service Specific Terms, do not use the corresponding Service.
You can accept the Terms by checking a checkbox or clicking on a button indicating your acceptance of the terms or by actually using the Services.</p>Description of Service<p>We provide an array of services for online collaboration and management including word processor, spreadsheet, presentation tool, database application creator, email client, chat client, organizer, customer relationship management application and project management application ("Service" or "Services").
You may use the Services for your personal and business use or for internal business purpose in the organization that you represent.

You are responsible for obtaining access to the Internet and the equipment necessary to use the Services.
You can create and edit content with your user account and if you choose to do so, you can publish and share such content.</p>Subscription to Beta Service<p>We may offer certain Services as closed or open beta services ("Beta Service" or “Beta Services”) for the purpose of testing and evaluation.
You agree that we have the sole authority and discretion to determine the period of time for testing and evaluation of Beta Services.
We will be the sole judge of the success of such testing and the decision, if any, to offer the Beta Services as commercial services.
You will be under no obligation to acquire a subscription to use any paid Service as a result of your subscription to any Beta Service.
We reserve the right to fully or partially discontinue, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, any of the Beta Services with or without notice to you.

If we make significant changes to the Terms that affect your rights, you will be provided with at least 30 days advance notice of the changes by email to your primary email address.
You may terminate your use of the Services by providing Zoho notice by email within 30 days of being notified of the availability of the modified Terms if the Terms are modified in a manner that substantially affects your rights in connection with use of the Services.
In the event of such termination, you will be entitled to prorated refund of the unused portion of any prepaid fees.
Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any change to the Terms will be deemed to be your agreement to the modified Terms.</p>User Sign up Obligations<p>You need to sign up for a user account by providing all required information in order to access or use the Services.
If you represent an organization and wish to use the Services for corporate internal use, we recommend that you, and all other users from your organization, sign up for user accounts by providing your corporate contact information.

The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users in your organization account.
If your organization account is created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator role for your organization.
Make sure that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third party specifying such party’s roles and restrictions as an administrator of your organization account.</p>
<p>You are responsible for i) ensuring confidentiality of your organization account password, ii) appointing competent individuals as administrators for managing your organization account, and iii) ensuring that all activities that occur in connection with your organization account comply with this Agreement.

<p>You are responsible for taking necessary steps for ensuring that your organization does not lose control of the administrator accounts.
You may specify a process to be followed for recovering control in the event of such loss of control of the administrator accounts by sending an email to legal@zohocorp.com, provided that the process is acceptable to Zoho.
In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process, Zoho may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof satisfactory to Zoho demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization.
You agree not to hold Zoho liable for the consequences of any action taken by Zoho in good faith in this regard.</p>Personal Information and Privacy<p>Personal information you provide to Zoho through the Service is governed by Zoho Privacy Policy.
