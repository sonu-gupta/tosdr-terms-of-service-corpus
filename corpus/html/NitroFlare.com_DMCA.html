<p>NitroFlare takes all feasible measures to comply with applicable copyright legislation and standards.
However, due to nature of the Services and the massive amount of stored Content, we have to introduce certain legally recognized presumptions regarding users' actions and Content.
Please carefully consider the below before contacting us.
NitroFlare team shall do its best to cooperate with respective copyright owners.</p>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Absence of index
<p>NitroFlare is technically unable to index the vast amount of Content being uploaded or stored at the servers of NitroFlare.</p>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Automated filtering <p>NitroFlare has implemented automated filtering for shared Content to avert infringing of the User Agreement and supplemental polices.
Upon the results of filtering recognized copyrighted and/or infringing Content shall be withheld from sharing.
Such automated filtering is considered a supplementary measure and does not guarantee complete and accurate recognition of all infringing Content therefore it does not free copyright owner from the duty of identifying own copyrights being infringed.</p>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Content privacy
<p>Any Content accessible exclusively via private account within the terms of NitroStorage services is private and thus presumed fair use unless validly stated otherwise by rightful party.</p>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
No authority to make judgment of Content
<p>Without distinct Copyright owner's notification NitroFlare has no authority to make judgment whether each user is competent to upload Content to its servers (e.g.
whether such user is the owner of work, or is authorized a proxy of the owner.
whether the Content is uploaded for personal use.
whether the copyright has expired.
or if the Content is used under fair use, etc.) Any Content is considered as consistent with User Agreement unless otherwise notified by Copyright owner or any other authorized person in each particular case.</p>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Content availability
<p>The Content is considered available and unremoved only upon the ability of successful downloading of whole intact files constituting such Content.
Due to technical reasons NitroFlare URLs database may experience lags, which may cause existence of URLs indicating removed or non-existing Content.
Such URLs do not lead to Content and download attempts shall be denied by notification of a relevant error message.</p>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<strong>File name</strong>
<strong>
<p>Files are named by user at own discretion for personal convenience.
File names may uninformative, as well as human-readable, or supposedly descriptive of the alleged Content.
However the Content cannot be characterized for the file name.
Identification of the Content is only made upon accessing such Content in its entirety regardless of file names.</p>
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
