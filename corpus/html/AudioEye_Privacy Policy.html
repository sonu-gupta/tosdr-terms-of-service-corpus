<p>AudioEye is committed to safeguarding the personal information (“Personal Information”) of visitors to our website and individuals requiring assistance via the reader embedded without our clients’ websites, which we use to provide information regarding our web accessibility services.
The following statement (“Privacy Policy”) sets out the principles governing our use of Personal Information that we might obtain about you when you access our website (the “Website”) and when you use the associated services.
The Website and the services we provide are collectively referred to herein as the “Services.”</p>
<p>
</p>Collection of Information<p>When you use our Services, we collect various categories of Personal Information, which will generally include information that you provide to us directly as well as information that we collect automatically.</p>
<p>
</p>Information You Provide Directly<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Basic Information</strong>
</p>
<p>When you use the Services, we will collect information that you provide to us via the Website and via any agreements you’ve entered into with respect to the Services.
This information may include, for example, your first name, last name, residence address, phone number, and e-mail address.
We may also collect billing information, such as credit card numbers and related information as to use the Services.</p>
<p>When you interact with our online Help Desk (e.g., through the AudioEye Ally Toolbar), we will collect information necessary to assist you with your query, including your name, your comments/questions, and your e-mail address.
You may also optionally provide your phone number and relevant information relating to any assistive technology that might be used in connection with the Services.
When you contact us for information (www.audioeye.com/contact-us), we will collect your first name, last name, job title, e-mail address, phone number, company name/government agency, and website URL.

<p>When you request an accessibility analysis or request a demo, we will collect your first name, last name, job title, e-mail address, phone number, and company name/government agency.</p>
<p>When you use AudioEye Voice (e.g., through the AudioEye Ally Toolbar), we will collect certain audio files, associated text and transcriptions, and log files provided by you or generated in connection with various AudioEye modules.<br>When you sign up for a partner account (audioeye.allbound.com), we may collect all of the above forms of data as well as billing information, such as credit card numbers and related information.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Speech Data</strong>
</p>
<p>Certain AudioEye modules, including Voice, require you to provide speech data in order to use and experience the benefits of the particular module.
Such speech data may include the audio files, associated text and transcriptions, and log files provided by you or generated in connection with various AudioEye modules.
These AudioEye modules collect and process the speech data you input.
AudioEye or third parties acting under the direction of AudioEye, pursuant to confidentiality agreements, may use the speech data to develop, tune, enhance, and improve our Services.</p>
<p>In order to provide the text-to-speech conversion of data input into a form, a secure DigiCert TLS channel is established between the Client system and the AudioEye cloud-based speech engine.
Text data is transmitted securely to the speech generator, immediately converted into an audio stream, and delivered back to the client system via the same encrypted channel.<br>Because AudioEye delivers it’s solution via JavaScript and transforms all text to speech on the fly, there is no “second copy” of an audio version of a website.
For content on non-secure sites, we do leverage audio caching to improve the playback of commonly requested copy.</p>
<p>When the AudioEye tools are installed on a secure domain, AudioEye provides an audio overlay to the real-time information present on the site.
All text transmitted to AudioEye for speech conversion is done via a secure DigiCert TLS channel.
To ensure the highest standard of security, no audio is cached for secure sites.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Secure Forms</strong>
</p>
<p>When dealing with secure forms, AudioEye generates one-time-use audio files that describe the behavior of the forms.
The form submission is securely processed through the Publisher’s original secure infrastructure, and all data is communicated securely between the client and the Publisher’s server(s) as would be the case if the AudioEye product was never installed.
Raw form input data sent to the AudioEye platform for speech conversion will not contain a reference to the original form being populated.</p>
