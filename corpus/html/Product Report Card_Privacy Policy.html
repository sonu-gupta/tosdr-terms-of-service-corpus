</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>

</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of a verifiable consumer request.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless the request is excessive or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Alternatively, we may decline to respond to the request and notify you of our reason for doing so.</p> Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights <p>If you are 16 years of age or older and have obtained express consent from a parent or guardian to register as a panelist, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”).

Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>
<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized agent) may submit a request to us by visiting our “Data Privacy Requests” webpage at Contact Us.

We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
<p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least 12 months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.
