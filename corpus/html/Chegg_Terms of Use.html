Anyone using or accessing the Services from other locations does so on their own initiative and is responsible for compliance with United States' and local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, if and to the extent such laws are applicable.
We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Services and/or the provision of any content, program, product, service or other feature to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any such content, program, product, service or other feature that we provide.</p>

You agree not to view, copy, or procure content or information from the Services by automated means (such as scripts, bots, spiders, crawlers, or scrapers), or to use other data mining technology or processes to frame, mask, extract data or other materials from the Chegg Content (except as may be a result of standard search engine or Internet browser usage), unless formally authorized by Chegg under separate written agreement.

<br>
<p>
<strong>Service Modifications</strong>
</p>
<p>Chegg reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes to or discontinue any of the Services at any time.
Any description of the Services provided by Chegg is not a representation that the Services are working or will always work in that manner, as Chegg is continuously updating the Services, and these updates may not always be reflected in the Terms of Use.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Mobile Use</strong>
</p>
<p>The Services may offer features and services that are available to you via your mobile device.
These features and services may include, without limitation, the ability to upload content to the Services, receive messages from the Services, download applications to your mobile phone or access features from the Services (collectively, the "<strong>Mobile Features</strong>").
We may charge for Mobile Features and these charges will be disclosed prior to completion of registration for the Mobile Feature.
Also, standard messaging, data and other fees may be charged by your carrier.
Carrier fees and charges will appear on your mobile bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance.
Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Mobile Features and certain Mobile Features may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device.
Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues.</p>
<p>If you change or terminate your mobile account, you agree to promptly update your Chegg account information so that any messages or notices from Chegg regarding the Services are sent to you and not to the person who is assigned your old number.</p>
<p>For any of our mobile apps, you agree that the third-party store or platform through which our apps are available (including, without limitation, the Apple App Store) is not liable to you in connection with our apps.
If you use any ISBN scan feature of the Services, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the scanned code before relying on it.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Email and Text Message Notifications</strong>
</p>
<p>Notifications or receipts from Chegg will be delivered to you by email at the address you provided to Chegg when you created your account or as later updated.
You may also opt to receive text message reminders from Chegg, as a courtesy to you.
Please review our text message mobile disclosures, which are incorporated into the Terms of Use.
Chegg may contact you, sometimes through an automated or pre-recorded message, using the phone numbers you provide to Chegg, including wireless numbers, to remind you that rental books are due to be returned or otherwise provide the Services.
You are still responsible for compliance with the Terms of Use, including, e.g., timely return of your books, whether or not you receive such reminders via email, text or otherwise.
Chegg will not ask you for your personal information, account username, and password, or any information about you or your method of payment via email or text message.
If you receive such an email or text message purportedly from Chegg, it is fraudulent and Chegg will have no responsibility for any misuse of any information you provide as a result.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Account Cancellation</strong>
</p>
<p>You may request cancellation of your account at any time throughout your use of our Services.
To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, your account will only be cancelled and closed after you have returned all books that have been rented to you (if any) and all transactions have been processed including payment of assessed penalties or the cashing of any refund check, if applicable.
Chegg may cancel your account in its sole discretion any reason, including but not limited to inactivity or misuse.
Even if your account is cancelled, your photos, bibliographic and citation information, comments, likes, friendships, and any other data you have shared via the Services may persist within the Service after cancellation of your account (for example, if your content has been reshared by others).</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Payments and Payment Processing</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Validation:</strong> Chegg may require users of the Services to provide a valid method of payment (e.g., credit or debit card, PayPal account, etc.) tied to an account at a financial institution when they register for an account (to ensure users are able to make applicable payments to Chegg) or upon ordering products or services.
If a method of payment is required, you are responsible for ensuring that a valid method of payment is associated with your Chegg account at all times (either the original method of payment or a replacement).
To confirm your method of payment is valid, Chegg may initiate a "pending" charge on the account.
This charge will not be confirmed and, therefore, you will not be charged and it will simply disappear from your financial statement (usually within seven days - check with your financial institution for additional information).
Please be aware that this pending charge may be initiated each time you edit the payment information for your account or place an order that cannot be processed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Authorization Holds:</strong> For certain transactions (e.g., book rentals, tutoring sessions), we may authorize anticipated charges and taxes from your method of payment.
The amount of the authorization sought will depend on the transaction and may also vary depending on the nature of the payment method you have provided.
This is sometimes referred to as an authorization hold and these funds may not be available for your use.
If the fees incurred exceed the authorization hold (e.g., because of an auto-extension or unreturned, lost, stolen, or damaged book), we may automatically request additional authorization holds.
If the provider for your method of payment rejects any authorization, you agree that we may charge any other method of payment we have on file for you (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law).
At the conclusion or termination of an ongoing transaction (e.g., return of a rented book), if the charges do not exceed the amount due, the authorization for the amount not utilized will be released per the rules of your payment method provider.
The timeframe for an authorization hold to be removed will depend on the policies of your financial institution.You are responsible and liable for ensuring that enough funds are available in connection with the payment method used at the time any transaction is processed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Policies:</strong> Where your billing address is requested, you must provide the address and phone number your financial institution has on record, as well as the card's security code (e.g., CVC, CVV, CID).
Chegg will make reasonable efforts to process your transactions in a timely manner, but we make no guarantees regarding the processing time for charges.
Chegg may store your method of payment and you hereby acknowledge and agree that Chegg may charge you for, and you will pay for, any charges specified on the Services and for any auto-extension or unreturned, lost, stolen, or damaged books associated with your account under the terms of your book rental and in accordance with the General Policies.
For any books or other materials kept beyond the applicable rental term, you agree to be charged the applicable late fees as set out in our General Policies.
For any books or other rental materials that are never returned (an item is deemed "never returned" if it has not been returned in the period posted in our General Polices) or that are returned damaged, you agree to be charged for the value of the item(s) as set out in our General Policies.
Chegg reserves the right to place you into collections if you fail to timely pay for the products and services ordered through the Services.
collections may be done by Chegg or a third-party on Chegg's behalf.
You also agree that we may, at our discretion, send your account to a collection agency, and recover our reasonable costs of collection from you, if you fail to pay all fees due and owing to Chegg.
For security reasons or to otherwise confirm a financial instrument or payment, Chegg may delay mailings of books or otherwise delay providing payments or services even if such delay impacts a guaranteed delivery date.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Links, Content and Applications</strong>
</p>
<p>There may be links from the Services, or from communications you receive from the Services, to third-party web sites or online features.
The Services also may include third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse.</p>
<p>Functionality on the Services may also permit interactions between the Services and a third-party web site or online feature, including applications that connect the Services or your profile on the Services with a third-party site.

<strong>Outlines, Study Guides and Notes</strong>
</p>
<p>Chegg may permit users to upload and in some cases sell content for the purpose of aiding others in the education and learning process.
Users may not post content owned or created (except if it is in the public domain) by another person and hereby represent and warrant that: <strong>(i)</strong> each was created by the user and the user is the sole owner of all content posted to Services sites and all rights in such content (except for public domain content), including, without limitation, copyright and <strong>(ii)</strong> the posting of Content on or through the Services will not breach the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third-party.

<strong>Career Information and Jobs</strong>
</p>
<p> Chegg's site may help students identify potential careers by providing a basic description for a variety of potential jobs.
In some cases, Chegg may provide salary ranges for jobs, and point users to potential job opportunities in that field, based upon your interests and skills that you have represented to Chegg that you possess.
Chegg may also help identify skills that are commonly required for those jobs and recommend learning materials that (combined with your own efforts) may help you achieve better proficiency with those skills.
Chegg's attempts to assess your skills, identify gaps, and match those gaps to available learning materials may not be accurate in your particular circumstances.
Chegg is simply one starting point, not an exhaustive list of all potential jobs or opportunities that might be available to you, and in a fast-changing employment landscape Chegg does not guarantee that the descriptions, salaries and job opportunities set out on our site are always up to date, reflect the current job market, or are applicable to the market in your area.
We believe that the materials on our site, if you use them and apply yourself, can improve your skills and employability.
Still, Chegg does not provide in-depth, individualized job counseling, and your success in landing a job in a particular career depends on a wide variety of factors.
Our system's efforts to identify skills gaps, and recommend learning materials to address those gaps, may not result in improved employment prospects.
completing recommended classes is in not a guarantee of finding employment in that field, or any other field.
</p>
<p> Chegg may also help students or alumni find internships or entry level jobs or other positions by accepting postings of job descriptions from third-party employers, through its Internships.com website or other Chegg Websites.
Chegg does not confirm the accuracy of the postings, nor can Chegg know whether a particular position has been filled.
Chegg may recommend particular job postings to particular users based upon available data about the position or the user, or other criteria, but the actual criteria for job positions lie within the discretion of the employer and Chegg makes no representations about the suitability of any candidate for any listed position.

<strong>Legal Disputes</strong>
</p>
<p>If a dispute arises between you and Chegg, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.
Accordingly, you agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that relates to or arises out of the Terms of Use or the Services or your use of the Services (a "<strong>Claim</strong>") in accordance with the subsections below.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>General.</strong> You and Chegg agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (collectively, "<strong>Disputes</strong>") will be settled by binding arbitration.
except that either party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court.
Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Disputes if you provide Chegg with written notice of your desire to do so by email at https://www.chegg.com/contactus/ or regular mail at our offices located at Chegg, Inc., 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054, Attn: General Counsel within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms of Use (such notice, an "Arbitration Opt-out Notice").
If you do not provide Chegg with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth with respect to individual actions in small claims courts.
<strong>You acknowledge and agree that you and Chegg are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</strong> Further, unless both you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Legal Disputes" section will be deemed void.
This "Legal Disputes" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of the User Content and Activities provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Rules, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.</strong> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") then in effect, except as modified by this Section of these Terms of Use.
(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Process.</strong> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides forms for use in arbitration proceedings including a Demand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules here.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</strong> Unless you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Chegg submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Arbitrator's Decision.</strong> The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of Limitation of Liability section of these Terms of Use as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Chegg will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Fees.</strong> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Chegg will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Changes.</strong> If Chegg changes this Legal Disputes section, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to legal) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date.
By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Chegg in accordance with the provisions of this Section as of the date you first accepted the terms of these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</p>
<p>This "Legal Disputes" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Policies</strong>
</p>
<p>When using the Services, you are subject to any posted policies or rules applicable to features you use through the Services, including without limitation the General Policies and all policies referenced in the General Policies or elsewhere in this Agreement.
All such policies or rules are hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use.
These policies may change from time to time.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p> Please refer to our Privacy Policy (https://www.chegg.com/privacypolicy) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users.
You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy </p>
<p>
<strong>List Prices</strong>
</p>
<p>The list prices displayed on the Services for publications come from bibliographic information we receive from leading third-party sources and publishers.
Each list price is the publisher's suggested retail price.
To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg is not responsible for errors in that third-party data, including prices for the sale or purchase (buyback) of books.
If a title does not have a publisher's suggested list price, the Services may not show a list price in the online catalog.
If a product is listed at an incorrect price due to typographical error or an error in pricing information received from our suppliers or for any other reason, Chegg shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law), whether or not the order has been confirmed and your method of payment charged.
If your method of payment has already been charged and your order is canceled, Chegg will issue a credit to your method of payment.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Chegg Credit</strong>
</p>
<p>From time to time, Chegg may issue you "Chegg Credit." Upon providing you Chegg Credit, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg may place limits on its use, and Chegg Credit may not be moved from one Chegg Service to another.
If provided to you in exchange for goods or services or as a refund, it will not expire, though we may with notice after a posted period of time convert your credit to cash and send it to your address of record.
If the credit was given to you with terms explicitly authorizing redemption for cash, you may convert that credit to cash.
If you receive a credit from customer support, you may not redeem it for cash.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Chegg Discount Codes, Bonuses, Coupons, Loyalty Programs, Points Programs &amp.
Other Promotions</strong>
</p>
<p>From time to time, Chegg may offer discounts, bonuses, coupons, loyalty programs, points programs, sweepstakes, contests or other promotional incentives.
These incentives typically have their own specific rules, restrictions and limitations (e.g., limiting when, how often, and under what circumstances you may be eligible for the promotion).
You are responsible for carefully reviewing and complying with these applicable rules, restrictions and limitations.
You agree not to engage in any self-dealing, collusion, smurfing (defined as breaking large orders or sales transactions into multiple individual transactions for the purpose of obtaining multiple discounts or payments), or otherwise gaming or defrauding the system.
By participating in such promotions, you agree to be bound by the applicable rules and restrictions, and that Chegg, in its sole discretion, may deny payment or benefits to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (e.g., when it believes improper activity has occurred or when a code has expired).
All promotions may expire at any time without notice to recipients.
Discounts apply only toward the actual base product/service rental or purchase cost.
they do not apply to taxes, shipping, extension or late fees, or any other additional fees (e.g., conversion to purchase fees).</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Return of Digital Access Codes</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the Services, you may purchase, as a separate product, a digital access code (DAC) to certain Digital Content.
The DAC publishers allow only one user (one activation) of these codes.
Chegg will ship your ordered DAC to you in sealed packaging.
If the DAC packaging is opened, Chegg must assume that the code is activated and therefore cannot be resold.
Thus, you may not return a DAC with opened packaging for a refund.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Tax</strong>
</p>
<p>Rentals and purchases through the Services may be subject to taxes in many states.
Depending on your state and the nature of the product or service you receive from us, this may be a rental tax, sales tax and/or use tax.
Tax rates are different from state to state.
You are responsible for paying all such taxes.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Supplemental Materials</strong>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that supplemental materials (CDs and CD-ROMs, Workbooks, Study Guides) will be included with book rentals.
However, they are available for purchase on select titles.
If you receive your rental book with any of the above items, you are welcome to use it.
We ask that you return your book complete with any supplemental materials you received.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Asset Ownership</strong>
</p>
<p>All rentals remain the property of Chegg, or third-party partners for physical text books, even while the item is in your possession.
You may be given the option to purchase rented books from Chegg or third-party partners, either at the end of a rental cycle or at any point during the rental cycle.
If you wish to purchase a book you have rented through the Services, you may be able to do so by accessing your account on the Services and looking for the purchase option.
In this case, title (ownership) transfers to you as soon as your method of payment is approved for purchase value.
If you purchase the title through our purchase program, title (ownership) changes hands when we or our third-party partners provide the book to the shipping company.
Certain digital products may not be available for purchase or may have different purchase terms, and you should review their specific terms prior to rental or purchase.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Certain Payments and Renewals</strong>
</p>
<p>Payment for certain Services is due in advance of each applicable membership period (e.g., monthly or annually).
<strong>MONTHLY AND ANNUAL MEMBERSHIPS MAY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON FILE FOR YOU WILL BE CHARGED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH RENEWAL PERIOD UNTIL YOUR MEMBERSHIP IS TERMINATED BY US OR CANCELLED BY YOU.
IF ANY OF OUR CHARGES ARE REJECTED FROM THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU HAVE INDICATED IS YOUR PREFERABLE PAYMENT METHOD, YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION: (I) RETRY SUCH PAYMENT METHOD.
AND/OR (II) COLLECT FROM ANY OTHER PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON FILE FOR YOU.</strong> Also, for some of our paid Services, you may elect to temporarily "suspend" your membership, for example, during school breaks or vacation, for up to a total of 90 days in any one membership year (i.e., during each 12-month period following the commencement of your membership), and the period of your membership will be extended by the total amount of such suspended period(s).
You agree to pay all applicable fees for your memberships and use of our paid Services, plus any applicable taxes or other charges as may be required, when due and payable.
All fees and charges are payable in advance and non-refundable, including after cancellation, unless otherwise disclosed at the time of purchase.
If you wish to cancel your membership in a Service (if available), please visit the customer support web area on the Services.
Cancellation of memberships (if available) will take effect as detailed in the cancellation information for the specific Service you want to cancel.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Free Trial Memberships</strong>
</p>
<p>We may from time to time offer free trials for some of our Services.
Such trials may require you to register with a valid credit card to commence.
Users that sign up for a free trial membership at a particular level will be automatically renewed at the promoted membership rate for that level at the end of the trial period unless the user cancels the membership at least before the end of the trial, unless the terms of the offer explicitly state otherwise.
You can cancel a free trial online on the Services or by contacting Chegg's customer support.
After cancellation of a free trial, you may be able to continue as a Free Member with reduced benefits or access.
Only one free trial membership is allowed per person.
Subsequent registrations do not qualify for free trials.
Unless the terms of a promotion state otherwise, for promotions that include "free" periods with "paid" periods, paid periods will elapse first.
We may introduce new or additional features, services or materials to the Services which may be a part of, or priced separately from, existing levels of membership at our sole discretion.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Chegg Honor Code</strong>
</p>
<p>We know that most of you have never and will never abuse the Services or any of the information, services or materials available through them.
You agree to abide by our Honor Code.</p>
<p>You may not use any of the solutions, answers, materials or information available on or through the Services, to cheat.
Examples include:</p>
<p>1.
Submitting any textbook solutions from the Services as your own to any class.<br> 2.
Using our questions and answers service to complete tests or homework when instructed not to use outside help.<br> 3.
Otherwise passing along any solutions, answers, materials or information from the Services as your own.<br> 4.
Any other violation of your instructor's or school's academic honor code.</p>
<p>We will take swift action against anyone found violating this Honor Code.
If Chegg is presented with evidence that its Services have been used in a manner contrary to its Honor Code or any other part of these Terms of Use, Chegg may, in its sole discretion, remove the materials and terminate the account of the involved users.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>A message to students:</strong>
</p>
<p>As current and former students, the Chegg team understands the pressures and time constraints school creates.
That being said, we also know from the unfortunate tales of our peers that the risk you take by violating your school's code of academic integrity is not worth the reward.
Copying solutions or posting unexplained final answers promotes completion without comprehension, and that's something we don't support on the Services.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>A message to educators:</strong>
</p>
<p>We are always seeking opportunities to work with educators in making our Websites a valuable resource for both you and your classroom for years to come.
If you need to contact us concerning an issue of academic integrity, please e-mail us at on Honor Code .</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Use, if any provision of the Terms of Use is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions continue in full force and effect.
The failure of Chegg to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use is not a waiver of such right or provision.
The section titles of the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
Non-performance of either party, except for the failure to make required payments, will be excused to the extent performance is delayed or rendered impossible by any reason where failure to perform is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party.
This "Miscellaneous" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Changes</strong>
</p>
<p>Chegg may modify the Terms of Use including the linked policies contained herein from time to time ("Updated Terms").
You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Chegg Website so that they are accessible via a link on the home page, and that your use of our Services after we have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify), you agree to be bound by the then-current version of the Terms of Use, including any changes we may have made since the last time you used our Services.
It is therefore important that you review the Terms of Use regularly to ensure you are aware of any such changes.
The updated Terms of Use will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms of Use, and will apply to your use of the Services from that point forward.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>The then-current Terms of Use, including (a) any related policies and terms referenced in the Terms of Use and (b) any Additional Terms, are the entire agreement between you and Chegg regarding the Services.
The Terms of Use may not be modified without the consent of a duly authorized representative of Chegg and will supersede and prevail over any terms or conditions you may include with any purchase order or other transaction document or communication with us, regardless of whether Chegg signs them or fails to object to them.
This "Entire Agreement" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>
