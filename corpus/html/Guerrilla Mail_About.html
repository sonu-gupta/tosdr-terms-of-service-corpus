FAQ
<p>Q: <strong>How can I view the spam folder?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: There is no spam folder / spam box.
All emails that arrive at Guerrilla Mail are delivered to your inbox.
If an email didn't arrive, it's most likely a problem on the other side, unless we're having a bad day...
If you are a webmaster, Guerrilla Mail can also be used to test if your site sends the emails out correctly.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>What is a Scrambled Address?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Since Guerrilla Mail doesn't require account registration, anyone who knows the Inbox ID may have access to that inbox.
So it's best to use a random address.
To add protection, you can use the Scramble Address feature.
A Scrambled Address can only be know if the Inbox ID is known and you cannot use a Scrambled as an Inbox Id.
The more hard-to-guess your Inbox ID is, the better your Alias will protect you.
</p>
<p> Q: <strong>Do email addresses expire?</strong>
</p>
<p> A: The current version keeps all incoming email for 1 hour.
This means all addresses work all the time, they never expire.</p>
<p>
When an email arrives at Guerrilla Mail, it waits in the quarantine ready to be picked up.
If a user checks their inbox, Guerrilla Mail will check the quarantine for new email.
If found, the email will be instantly moved to the user's inbox.
Else, emails will be deleted from the quarantine if they wait there for longer than one hour.
</p>
<p>
Once the email is in an inbox, it will be given 1 hour more, or until the user deletes it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Emails that were never delivered to an active inbox are marked abandoned and are most likely spam.</p>
<p>
(The older version of Guerrilla Mail expired the address after 1 hour and bounced any inactive addresses.)</p>
Privacy
<p>Guerrilla Mail deletes all email that was delivered to an inbox after 1 hour.</p>
<p>We normally keep the logs turned off, this is because due to high traffic, our server does not have the resources required</p>
<p>Emails delivered to an inbox are treated with the most privacy, however, please note that anyone who knows your Inbox ID may access your inbox.
Using a Scrambled Address will further protect your privacy.

Our Technology
<p>Guerrilla Mail consists of a web server (Nginx), a database server (MySQL) and a Mail Server (Go Guerrilla).
The design goal and purpose of Go Guerrilla is to receive large volumes of email and nothing much else.
It happily gobbles down millions of emails daily.
Go Guerrilla is an open source project available from GitHub.
If you do invite Go Guerrilla to your system, please remember to feed it with lots of spam, spam is what it likes best!</p>
<p>The front-end parts of the website are written in PHP and JavaScript.
We make heavy use of jQuery in our JavaScript code, and it is written in such a way that it will default to a HTML version if JavaScript isn't available.
We also have an API.
Actually, our front-end uses this API for everything on this site.</p>
