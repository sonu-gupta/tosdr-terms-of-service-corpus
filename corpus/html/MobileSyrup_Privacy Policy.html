What IP Address Information is Collected and How is It Used?
<p>An IP address is the unique number that is assigned to every direct Internet access point.
Many IP addresses can generally be associated with certain Internet service providers or large organizations.
When you, through your browser, request a web page or similar Internet information from another computer on the Internet, your browser automatically provides that computer with an IP address to which it will send the requested information.</p>
<p>Whenever you request a Blue Ant Media Service web page or certain other similar Blue Ant Media content, your browser automatically provides our computers with your IP address, to which our computers will send the requested information.
Each such request is logged by our computers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page and is stored by our computers as needed for the purposes described in this policy.</p>
<p>We may use your IP address to display more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on your geographic area.
Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may be reported by us to our advertisers and partners.
For example, we may report to our advertisers the estimated total number of users accessing a particular Blue Ant Media Site from a specific province.
