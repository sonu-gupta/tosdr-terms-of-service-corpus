The safety and security of your information also depends on you.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites or Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and not sharing it with anyone.
We also encourage you to use caution when using the Internet as it is not 100% secure.
Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted electronically and we cannot promise that your use of our Sites and Services will be completely safe.
Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.
We are also not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites.</p>
<p>If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on a NETGEAR website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e.
your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither NETGEAR nor you have control over.
Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions.
NETGEAR is not responsible for the Personal Information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

<p>We also take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it or when you request its deletion, unless we are allowed or required by law to keep the information for a longer period.
We complete periodic reviews of our databases, and have established time limits for certain data deletion, taking into account the type of services provided in the context of the Products and Services, the length of our relationship with you, mandatory retention periods, and the statute of limitations.</p>
