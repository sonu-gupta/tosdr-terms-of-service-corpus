<p>
</p>
<p>15.9.6 Other important terms</p>

This Clause 15.9.7 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between Licensee and Sophos including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.

and claims that may arise after the termination of this License Agreement.
The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.<br> (ii) Initial Dispute Resolution.
Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration.
Licensee and Sophos agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with each other, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
To commence this procedure, Licensee agrees to contact Sophos’ support department via our support portal at&nbsp;https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/support/contact-support.aspx&nbsp;or The Legal Department, Sophos Limited, The Pentagon, Abingdon Science Park, Abingdon, OX14 3YP, United Kingdom with a copy to&nbsp;legalnotices@sophos.com, and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and Licensee’s contact information (including information that could be used to identify Licensee’s registered account if Licensee’s dispute relates to an account).
Alternatively, Sophos may contact Licensee using the last available information it has for Licensee.<br> (iii) Binding Arbitration.
If the Licensee and Sophos do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either You or Sophos may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims (except as provided in (v) below) subject to the terms set forth below.
Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to this License Agreement (including, but not limited to, its formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or Licensee’s download of, access to, or use of the Licensed Products shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.&nbsp;<br> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this License Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this License Agreement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.

If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Sophos will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration.
Licensee is responsible for Licensee’s own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.<br> The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.<br> If Licensee is a resident of the United States or commences litigation within the United States, arbitration may take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.
Residents of the United States, those who commence litigation within the United States, and Sophos further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br> (iv) Class Action Waiver.
The parties further agree that the resolution of any disputes between the parties shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.&nbsp;YOU AND SOPHOS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.&nbsp;If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.<br> (v) Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through initial dispute resolution or binding arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court or in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
