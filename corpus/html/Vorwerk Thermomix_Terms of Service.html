Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that Vorwerk post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to Vorwerk to enforce any provision of this Agreement.
Any claim you might have against Vorwerk must be brought within two (2) years after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.

Please contact Vorwerk if you wish to receive a printed copy of this Agreement.
