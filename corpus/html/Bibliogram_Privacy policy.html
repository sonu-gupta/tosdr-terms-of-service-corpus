        Privacy policy for Bibliogram visitorsData collected by Bibliogram<p>Bibliogram logs all incoming request URLs and the time of the request
to the console, but does not log headers, IP addresses, or other
information.
These logs are not stored on disk.
</p>Data collected by nginx<p>This server uses nginx as a reverse proxy to Bibliogram.
nginx is
configured to use the default logging settings, which means that this
data is logged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request timestamp</li>
<li>Request URL</li>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Reported user agent</li>
<li>Reported referrer</li>
</ul>
<p>These logs are saved to disk and deleted after 10 days.
</p>Exporting or deleting your data<p>Since Bibliogram does not associate any stored data with a user
identifier, we cannot export or delete "your" data since we have
no concept of "you".
</p>How Instagram data is collected and stored<p>Only public data from Instagram is collected, never private data.
This data is only used for the purpose of responding to incoming web requests.</p>
<p>Data about Instagram posts is never saved to disk.</p>
<p>Basic information about Instagram user profiles, like the user's username,
display name and bio, is saved to disk.
It is deleted when the Instagram user deletes their account.
