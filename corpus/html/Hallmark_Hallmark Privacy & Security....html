<p>At Hallmark, we are committed to the security and privacy of your information.
When you provide us with information about yourself, we only share that information with our partners, like the businesses which help process your orders, service providers (like delivery companies), and contractors.
We give them this information to help fulfill your orders, offer you products and services, and other consumer service-based needs.
Likewise, these companies provide information to us so we can provide you with product or service suggestions we think you might be interested in.</p>
<p>Hallmark allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and pixels on our sites, which allow these companies to receive information about your activity on our websites.
Those companies may use that data to show you more relevant advertisements and promotions.
Learn more about your ability to control privacy settings at the companies we work with, which include but are not limited to, Adobe, Facebook/Instagram, Verizon, LiveRamp, Pinterest and Google/YouTube.</p>
<p>You always have control over whether these technologies work on your devices.
You can disable them entirely by opting-out of third-party cookies or using your mobile device ID for targeted advertising.
You can also use preferences or settings on your device(s) to manage your privacy controls.</p>
<p>Any non-Hallmark company we work with is contractually not allowed to use this information in any other way.
We value the trust you place in us, and this is one way we strive to preserve it.</p> Security

In other words, the parties to whom we provide your information are people that help us help you.
And we require them to join us in keeping your information safe.</p>
<p>While we are careful with how your information is treated and are selective when choosing other companies and websites with which we interact, any site Hallmark links to is out of our control.
