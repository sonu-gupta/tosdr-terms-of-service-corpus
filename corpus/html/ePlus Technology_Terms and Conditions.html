Customer Terms and Conditions for Products and/or Services <p>1.
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS VERY CAREFULLY.
The customer (“Customer”) and ePlus Technology, inc.
(“ePlus”) hereby agree to the following terms and conditions, which will be incorporated by reference into any contract for provision of product and/or service by ePlus.
These Terms and Conditions (these “Terms”) represent the complete and final agreement between the customer and ePlus for the matters set forth herein.
By placing an order with ePlus or an ePlus affiliate for products or services Customer agrees to be bound by and accepts these Terms unless Customer and ePlus have entered into a separate written agreement signed by a senior corporate officer of ePlus (a “Written Contract”), in which case the Written Contract will govern.
Customer may issue an ordering document or purchase order for administrative purposes only.
Additional or different terms contained in any such purchase order will be null and void.
Terms contained in purchase orders, offers to buy, terms and conditions, and the like shall have no effect.
any additional or different terms or conditions in any form delivered by Customer are hereby deemed to be material alternations and notice of objection to them and rejection of them is hereby given.
In no event shall ePlus’ performance under a purchase order, statement of work or similar instrument be deemed to constitute acceptance of any terms and conditions other than as set forth herein.
ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND RESULT THEREOF POSTED ON THE EPLUS WEB SITE DO NOT CONSTITUTE PART OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN EPLUS AND CUSTOMER.
</p>
<p>2.Orders.
Orders are not binding until accepted by ePlus.
As order delivery times are estimates only, ePlus is not liable for any delays that are beyond its control.
Approvals for order cancellations, suspensions or alterations are subject to manufacturer policies and guidelines and ePlus’ ability, pursuant to those policies and guidelines, to cancel/suspend orders to its suppliers.
Prior to the shipment, except for products that have been irreversibly configured or customized, customer may cancel, suspend or alter all or a portion of an order.
An alteration includes: (i) changing a location for delivery, (ii) modifying the quantity of the product to be delivered, (iii) changing the requested delivery date, or (iv) correcting any typographical or clerical errors.
</p>
<p>3.Pricing.
Prices for products and services shall be as identified in an order accepted by ePlus.
ePlus strives to provide its customers with pricing that is competitive based on the circumstances at the time that an order is placed.
However pricing is subject to variation based on manufacturer discounts and price list changes, order volume, specific services and personnel provided, the circumstances and needs of each customer, and other factors.
EPLUS CANNOT AND DOES NOT MAKE GUARANTEES REGARDING THE PRICING OR RELATED TERMS APPLICABLE TO AN ORDER.
NO COMPARATIVE PRICE GUARANTY, PRICE WARRANTY, “MOST FAVORED CUSTOMER” PROVISION OR SIMILAR PRICING COMMITMENT SHALL APPLY TO ORDERS ACCEPTED BY EPLUS, AND ANY SUCH TERMS THAT MAY BE SET FORTH IN A PURCHASE ORDER OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENT ARE HEREBY REJECTED.
</p>
<p>4.Title, Ownership and Inspection.
Title to product is retained by ePlus until the product is paid for in full by the customer.

To the extent that Existing Materials are incorporated in Work Products, ePlus grants to customer and its Affiliates a royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual right to use, modify and prepare derivative works of such Existing Materials and to use and display such Existing Materials, with full rights to authorize others to do the same but subject to any supplier restrictions and only to the extent required to utilize the Work Product in accordance with the ownership rights granted in this Agreement.
Loss or damage that occurs during shipping by a carrier selected by ePlus shall be ePlus’ sole responsibility.
loss or damage that occurs during shipping by a carrier selected by customer shall be customer’s sole responsibility.
If damaged products are accepted from the carrier, such damage should be noted on the carrier delivery record.
Customer should save the product and the original box/packaging and notify ePlus to arrange for a carrier inspection and a pickup of damaged products.
Please notify your account executive of any damaged shipping containers within the first two (2) days of receipt.
Two (2) days is considered a reasonable period of time to conduct the visual inspection of the shipping container, and failure to provide such notice will constitute acceptance in full.
Customer also shall notify ePlus of any order shortages or any concealed damages within seven (7) business days.
These notification timeframes are necessary so that ePlus may assist customer on a timely basis in obtaining the benefit of any manufacturer warranties as well as filing any shipping claims with the carrier, as applicable.
</p>
<p>5.Payment.
Unless otherwise agreed to in a Written Contract, payment terms are net 30 from date of invoice.
Customer shall bear applicable federal, state, municipal and other government taxes (such as sales, use and similar taxes).
Unless specified, prices do not include tax, shipping or handling.
Tax exemption certificates must be supplied prior to shipment if they are to be honored.
Late payment charges of 1.5% per month, or the maximum amount allowed by law (whichever is less), will apply to any amount not received by the due date.
In the event ePlus must resort to collection, customer will be responsible for all collections costs, including legal fees.
If the "Bill To" party is different from the "Ship To" party, the "Ship To" party is responsible for all payments and late charges if the "Bill To" party fails to make payment.
In any case where Customer receives products or services but the purchase authorization is provided from a third party to be billed pursuant to a lease or financing arrangement, payment of the invoice will be Customer’s responsibility in the event such third party fails to make timely payment.
.
Any communications concerning disputed debts, including any instrument tendered as full satisfaction of the disputed debt, are to be sent to the Office of General Counsel, ePlus Technology, inc., 13595 Dulles Technology Drive, Herndon, VA 20171.
</p>
<p>6.Product Returns.
Approvals for unused, unopened returns are subject to manufacturer return policies and guidelines and ePlus’ ability to return product to its vendors.
Such products must be complete and in manufacturer’s original packaging, with no visible damage.
ePlus will not be required to accept any return of sold products without an approved return merchandise authorization (“RMA”) number, which may be obtained by contacting the customer’s account executive.
A RMA is valid for ten (10) days from the ePlus issuance date, unless other arrangements are made between the parties at the time of ePlus’ RMA approval.
The ePlus RMA number is to be clearly noted on a shipping label affixed to the outer shipping box and any items received into an ePlus return facility without an RMA number or after the elapsed time period will be sent back to the customer at the customer’s expense, unless otherwise agreed to under a Written Contract.
Any writing, markings or stickers, except shipping label, on the box will void any authorized return.
Except in the event of an ePlus or vendor error, customer will be responsible for shipping charges associated with any products being shipped for return, exchange or replacement.
Products exchanged or replaced will be shipped back to customer, at customer’s expense.
Returns must be made via an authorized carrier that allows the package to be tracked, and customer must insure all returned products.
Products not eligible for return include, but are not limited to, items that were at end-of-life cycle at the time of order, used or opened software, used consumables, custom configured and built to order products, and products not purchased through ePlus.
At ePlus’ discretion, restocking fees may be charged for items which do not qualify for return under this policy.
Some manufacturers require that defective or Dead on Arrival (DOA) products be returned directly to them, or they may limit the timeframe in which products can be returned.
therefore, products that are inoperable at initial use may be eligible for DOA return to or replacement by the manufacturer, subject to the manufacturer’s product defective/DOA return policies.
If the product is not returnable under manufacturer guidelines, ePlus will make every attempt to repair or replace the product through the manufacturer’s warranty.
Customer should contact its ePlus account executive for further details on the manufacturer warranties.
ePlus technicians test products returned as DOA or defective.
Products found not to be defective may be subject to return at the customer’s expense.
In any event, ePlus will work with its vendors to facilitate returns for the customer.
</p>
<p>7.Services.
Services provided by ePlus or its subcontractor shall be pursuant to an applicable statement of work executed by the ePlus and Customer.
All services shall be deemed accepted upon completion or within five (5) business days of delivery to Customer of a milestone or completion certificate as may be provided in an applicable statement of work.
Certain services including, but not limited to maintenance, support, extended manufacturer warranty service, and other services provided under a manufacturer’s SKU identified in a purchase order, are sold by ePlus as a reseller without a statement of work.
("Third Party Services").
For such Third Party Services, the third party service provider shall be solely responsible for providing the services to the Customer, and Customer will look exclusively to such third party for any loss, claims, liability or damages arising from or related to the provision of such Third Party Services.
Customer hereby releases ePlus and each of its affiliates from any and all claims arising from or relating to the purchase, sale or performance of any such Third Parties Services.
</p>
<p>8.Warranties.
In the event ePlus performs services pursuant to a statement of work, ePlus represents and warrants that such services will be done in a skillful and workmanlike manner according to those industry standards generally prevailing among consultants performing similar services under similar circumstances.
Customer shall notify ePlus of any noncompliance with the foregoing warranty prior to completion of the services or within five (5) business days thereafter.
ePlus or its supplier will pass through to customer any and all applicable hardware or software product warranties of the manufacturer.
ePlus does not provide any warranties on products which it does not manufacture, whether with respect to its design, performance, specifications, functionality or compatibility with customer’s system.
No statement or affirmation by ePlus or its agents, by action or word, shall constitute a warranty and Customer agrees torely solely on the manufacturers’ warranties.
ePlus will not be liable for any damage, loss, cost or expense for breach of warranty.
As ePlus has no control over the manufacturing of the products sold herein, it cannot and does not indemnify customer for claims by third parties that products infringe any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret.
however, ePlus will pass through any such indemnities it receives from the manufacturer or supplier.
EPLUS HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATED TO PRODUCTS SOLD OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THIS DISCLAIMER, HOWEVER, DOES NOT AFFECT THE TERMS OF THE MANUFACTURER’S WARRANTY, IF ANY.
</p>
<p>9.End User Agreements.
Customer agrees to abide by all product licensing provisions or end user agreements imposed by the manufacturer or publisher.
</p>
<p>10.LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

EPLUS’ LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES, WHICH WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER TO EPLUS FOR THE SPECIFIC PRODUCT(S) OR SERVICE(S) DIRECTLY CAUSING THE DAMAGES GIVING RISE TO A PROVEN CLAIM, AS ESTABLISHED BY A FINAL JUDGMENT.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER ANY CLAIM IS BASED UPON PRINCIPLES OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORT, BREACH OF ANY STATUTORY DUTY, PRINCIPLES OF INDEMNITY OR CONTRIBUTION, THE FAILURE OF ANY LIMITED OR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY TO ACHIEVE ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, OR OTHERWISE.

</ol> Code of Conduct Version History The Board last approved changes to the Code of Conduct on June 18, 2018<br>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Description of Revisions: &nbsp;</strong>Revisions include: &nbsp;Specifically referencing the Company’s Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy.
Updating the Equal Opportunity section to be broader.</p> Introduction <p>ePlus requires all employees to use their judgment, to be accountable for their actions, and to conduct business with integrity.<br>
<br>
The ePlus Code of Conduct outlines the standards of ethical behavior ePlus expects of you in performing the duties of your position with ePlus.
Throughout this document, we will abbreviate these standards as the “Code.”<br>
<br>
You should keep in mind these important considerations when reading this Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Code applies to all of our employees, officers and directors regardless of location or<br> position.</li>
<li>You should follow this Code in letter and in spirit, along with any applicable laws,<br> regulations and other ePlus policies and procedures.</li>
<li>You may never violate this Code, or any Corporate Policy, simply because someone<br> directs you to do so.
If you receive such a request you must refuse, and you should followthe reporting procedures detailed within the Code.</li>
</ul>
In addition to governing conduct among employees, the Code governs conduct between<br>
employees and customers, competitors, and the numerous business providers who assist ePlus every day, including vendors and contractors.<br>
<br>
The Code has been approved by the ePlus Board of Directors.
Because we want our customers, business partners and investors to understand how we do business, and what they can expect from us, the Code is published on our corporate website, and also in the ePlus Employee Handbook.<br>
<br>
<strong>Amendments and Waivers<br>
</strong>
<br>
ePlus will publicly disclose all material amendments and any waivers for senior financial<br>
officers, executive officers or directors, to the extent required by law.
<p>&nbsp;</p> Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations <p>Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which ePlus’ ethical standards are built.
All employees and officers must respect and obey the laws, rules and regulations of the cities, states and countries in which we operate, whether or not specifically addressed in the Code.
Although employees and officers are not expected to know the details of each of these laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If a law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must comply with the law.
If you have any questions about conflicts, please discuss with your manager, HR, the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel for additional guidance.
You may also seek advice from any attorney or other advisor you select, at your expense.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Antitrust Laws&nbsp;<br>
</strong>

You must comply with applicable antitrust and similar laws that regulate competition in the countries in which we operate.

</strong>
<br>
Customers, suppliers, and government agencies rely upon the integrity of our business records.

We will not create or permit false or misleading entries to be made in the records of the Company under any circumstances.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Public Disclosures&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
ePlus requires full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that are filed with, or submitted to, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public filings and communications.&nbsp.
The standards for accounting and financial reporting require the proper recording of, and accounting for, revenues, costs, expenses, assets, and liabilities.&nbsp.
If you have responsibility for, or any involvement in, these areas, you must understand and adhere to these rules and prepare all reports, books and records of ePlus with care and honesty, and adhere to all internal control policies and procedures.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Violations of laws associated with accounting and financial reporting can result in fines, penalties, and imprisonment and they can lead to a loss of public faith in the Company.
If you become aware of any action related to accounting or financial reporting that you believe may be improper, you should submit your concerns to the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel.
Alternatively, employees can use the ePlus internal web-based communication channel, VOICE IT, or call the Hotline, which is managed by a third-party service provider.
Callers have the option to remain anonymous.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Expenses&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
Employees are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable business-related expenses, but only if those expenses were actually incurred and fall within the parameters detailed within the ePlus Travel and Expense Policy.
Business expense reports must be accurate, include all supporting documentation, and be submitted in a timely manner.
Submitting an expense account for meals not eaten, miles not driven, airline tickets not used, or any other expense not incurred as submitted, is dishonest reporting.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Data Privacy&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
ePlus typically does not possess personal information, except with regard to our employees.&nbsp.
&nbsp;We take appropriate steps to protect information relating to individuals, whether they are employees, customers, investors or vendor partners.&nbsp.
We are responsible for collecting, processing and transferring personal data only for lawful and legitimate business purposes, and use care in safeguarding the confidentiality and security of personal data, and in respecting personal privacy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Workplace Privacy&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>
<ul>
<li>Access, search, monitor, and archive all data and messages sent, accessed, viewed, or stored;</li>
<li>Conduct physical, video, or electronic surveillance (as permitted by law).
and</li>
<li>Review IM, phone, and similar records, and web-surfing history.</li>
</ul> Our People ePlus’ success depends on its employees.
It depends on people who innovate and are committed to growing our business responsibly, people who dedicate themselves to really satisfying customers, helping partners, and people who are accountable for achieving challenging goals with unwavering integrity.
People who are leaders, who appreciate that to be truly great, we must continually strive to better ourselves, and help others improve.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Equal Opportunity&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
ePlus employs, trains, promotes and compensates individuals based on merit, job-related qualifications and abilities.
ePlus is committed to providing equal opportunity without regard to race, color, religion/religious creed, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), gender, gender expression, gender identity, transgender, sexual orientation, national origin (including ancestry), age, marital status (including same-sex marriages), genetic information/predisposition/carrier status, physical/mental disability or medical condition, military/veteran status, or any other classification protected under federal, state, or local law.<br>
<br>
<strong>No Harassment&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
Any kind of harassment by or against our employees is prohibited.&nbsp.
All employees must comply with our Sexual Harassment Policy.&nbsp.
Prohibited conduct includes the making of unwelcome sexual advances or engaging in any other conduct with sexual overtones which interferes with an individual’s work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.&nbsp.
All instances of sexual harassment should be reported, and will be investigated, as described in the Sexual Harassment Policy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Health and Safety&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
ePlus is committed to providing employees with a safe and healthy work environment.
All employees have a responsibility for maintaining the health and safety of the work environment by following environmental, safety and health rules and practices, and for reporting accidents, injuries, and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.&nbsp;<br>
All employees are expected to perform their company-related work in a safe manner, free from the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Workplace Violence&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
We all deserve to work in an environment that is free from violence or hostility.
ePlus will not tolerate any threatening, hostile or abusive behavior by employees, or from anyone with whom an ePlus employee comes into contact in the course of doing business for ePlus.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You must report any instance of violence, hostile behavior or brandishing of weapons on Company property to your supervisor or Human Resources immediately.
Firearms are not permitted on ePlus property, except where expressly permitted by law.&nbsp.
In cases of imminent danger, you should call 911 or local law enforcement first, and then the General Counsel, Human Resources, or your manager.
Supervisors are expected to inform the VP of Human Resources or the General Counsel no later than 24-hours after any reports or act or threat of violence, even if the situation has been addressed and resolved.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Leadership&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
We expect our leaders to set an example and be role models in every respect.
As leaders, you must ensure that employees have sufficient information to comply with laws and policies, and create a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance.
This culture must encourage all employees to raise concerns when they arise.
We must never sacrifice ethical and compliant behavior in the pursuit of business objectives or generate an environment where employees are fearful to raise concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Working with Others The integrity of ePlus is a key component of our reputation, trustworthiness and service.
The people that ePlus conducts business with expect and deserve fair, honest and respectful information and service.
You are responsible for your role in the delivery of that standard of service.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Relations with Government Officials and Employees&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
You may not make any payments to or for the benefit of any government official or employee in order to secure business or to obtain special concessions.
Relations with government representatives, even where personal friendships may be involved, must be legal, in good taste and such that full public disclosure would in no way damage ePlus’ reputation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Relations with Contractors and Vendors&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
Relationships with our contractors and vendors are to be managed in a fair and reasonable manner, consistent with applicable laws and ethical business practices.
The selection of contractors and vendors will be made on the basis of objective criteria, including quality, technical excellence, price, delivery, adherence to schedules, service and maintenance of adequate sources of supply.
Purchasing decisions will be based on the vendor’s ability to meet our needs, and not on personal relationships and friendships.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Authority to make ePlus Commitments&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
The ePlus management system and contracting processes are designed to help ePlus protect its assets and to provide the appropriate controls needed for ePlus to run its business effectively with its customers, business partners, vendors and other third parties.
Authorities are defined within the ePlus ‘Authority Matrix’.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Commitments must be visible to ePlus accounting to help ensure the accuracy of ePlus’ financial results.
Making business commitments outside of the most current and internally published Authority Matrix is prohibited.&nbsp.
Conflicts of Interest ePlus respects the right of all employees to engage in personal activities outside of work.
However, each of us has the responsibility to avoid activities and relationships which conflict with our job responsibilities or the interests of ePlus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Any employee activity that may involve a conflict of interest, or may reasonably create an appearance of a conflict of interest, must first be approved by the Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of the Chief Compliance Officer or Company legal counsel, and must be in compliance with the Company’s Related Person Transaction Policy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Examples of Conflicts of Interest include:<br>
<br>
</strong>
<ul>
<li>Holding a significant and undisclosed financial interest in a current or reasonably anticipated customer, supplier or competitor of ePlus, or serving as an employee consultant or director of that business.&nbsp.
(Holding a small amount, such as less than 5%, of the publicly-traded stock of our suppliers or customers would not constitute a conflict of interest.)</li>
<li>Directing ePlus business to a supplier owned or managed by a relative.</li>
<li>Accepting “spiffs” from vendors other than in accordance with our Gift Policy.</li>
<li>Using confidential ePlus information for personal benefit, or for the benefit of others.</li>
<li>Performing work or rendering services for any entity who does, or seeks to do, business with ePlus, outside the normal course of your employment, without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer (or the Board of Directors, if you are an executive officer).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Gifts&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
Although the exchange of gifts and entertainment can promote a successful working relationship and goodwill, you must follow all applicable laws and company rules and procedures.
You should assume that any gift given or received will be made public, and should not offer or accept any gift that might reasonably be viewed negatively if disclosed.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
ePlus has a Gift Policy that addresses common gift situations, and with which all employees are required to comply.&nbsp.
ePlus also has an online reporting tool for employees to report gifts given or received that are not otherwise addressed under the policy.&nbsp.
The Gift Policy can be found on eConnect, in the Human Resources’ policies section.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Improper Payments&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
It is never appropriate to offer or receive bribes, kickbacks or improper payments.
This prohibition applies to dealings with current and potential customers, suppliers, representatives, consultants or other business partners seeking to establish a relationship with ePlus.&nbsp.
Many countries and U.S.
states have laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and commercial bribery.&nbsp.
In particular, employees should be aware of, and comply with, the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K.
Bribery Act.&nbsp;<br>
If you are unsure if a payment or gift is inappropriate or illegal, you should seek guidance from the General Counsel.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Personally Gaining From Corporate Opportunities&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
You owe a duty to ePlus to advance its legitimate interests.
You cannot take any business opportunity you learn of as a result of your employment or use any ePlus property for your personal benefit or for the benefit of a family member.
For example, you should not acquire any interest in a company when you know that ePlus may take or is taking steps to acquire an interest in that company.
If you learn of a business opportunity you are interested in pursuing that is&nbsp;within ePlus’ existing or proposed lines of business, you should inform your supervisor, ePlus’ Chief Financial Officer or, in the case of executive officers, the Board of Directors.
You should not personally pursue the business opportunity until ePlus decides not to pursue it and grants approval for you to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Participation on Boards of Directors&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
It is a conflict of interest to serve as a director of a company that is in competition with ePlus.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Employees and officers should not serve as a director of any other for-profit company, other than on behalf of ePlus, without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer or, in the case of the Chief Financial officer, the Chief Executive Officer.&nbsp.
In the case of any employee who is also a director of ePlus, service as director of any other for-profit company must be approved by ePlus’ Board of Directors.&nbsp.
Confidential and Proprietary Information <strong>Confidentiality&nbsp;<br>
</strong>
<br>
Customers, vendors, and others disclose confidential information to ePlus for business purposes.
Each employee has a responsibility to protect and maintain the confidentiality of this information.&nbsp.
Failure to properly protect customer and third-party information may damage our relationships with these important business partners, and may result in legal liability.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
ePlus owns all information, in any form (including electronic information), that is created or used in support of its activities.
This information is a valuable asset and ePlus expects you to protect it from unauthorized disclosure.
This information includes ePlus customer, vendor, business partner and employee data.
Federal, state and foreign laws may restrict the use of this information and may penalize you if you use or disclose it.
You should protect information pertaining to ePlus’ competitive position, business strategies and information relating to negotiations with employees or third parties and share it only with employees who need to know it in order to perform his or her job.&nbsp.
Nothing in this policy shall be deemed to interfere with employee disclosure rights protected by law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Intellectual Property and Proprietary Information&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
You should carefully maintain and manage the intellectual property rights of ePlus to which you have access, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses and trade secrets, to preserve and protect their value.
In addition, you should respect the intellectual property rights of others.
If you violate other’s intellectual property rights, you and ePlus could face substantial liability, including criminal penalties.
Intellectual property that you create during the course of your employment belongs to ePlus.
You must share any innovations or inventions you create with your supervisor so that ePlus can take steps to protect these valuable assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Insider Trading&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
Federal and state securities laws and ePlus’ policies prohibit you from:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing or selling ePlus securities while you know material, nonpublic information about ePlus.
and </li>
<li> Disclosing material, nonpublic information, except as permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
In order to better protect non-public information, all confidential Company business information and information of our customers, vendors and business partners, should be disseminated internally only on a “need-to-know” basis.
For more information, employees should refer to the ePlus Insider Trading Policy which is posted on the Corporate Intranet and is included as an Appendix to the ePlus Employee Handbook.&nbsp;<br>
Because of the complexity of insider information and insider trading, and the severity of the punishments involved, which can include criminal prosecution, you should seek the advice of ePlus’ General Counsel on any questions regarding this subject.
In some cases, you may want to retain an attorney on your own to advise you.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Requests for information from the media, analysts, attorneys, law enforcement officers and others.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What may appear to be an innocent request for information could result in serious harm to our company.
Be alert to requests for information from outside of ePlus.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You should not initiate contact with the media, analysts, attorneys or others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you receive a request for information from these sources, you must direct the caller to the Company’s main telephone number (703) 984-8400 or 888-482-1122.
The call will then be directed to the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, or the Investor Relations Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Inadvertent Disclosure&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br>
To avoid inadvertent disclosure, never discuss with any unauthorized person confidential information.
Furthermore, you should not discuss such information even with authorized ePlus employees if you are in the presence of others who are not authorized, for example, at a trade show reception or in a public area.
You should also not discuss such information with family members or with friends, who might innocently or unintentionally pass the information on to someone else.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you ever suspect or know that you or someone else has inadvertently disclosed information that is confidential or non-public, you must contact the General Counsel immediately.&nbsp.
Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets Every employee must properly use, protect, and safeguard Company property, both tangible and intangible, as well as the property of our customers, vendors and business partners that is in our possession.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
ePlus’ assets include our physical assets and our extremely valuable proprietary information, such as ePlus’ intellectual property and ePlus confidential information, noted in the previous section.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Care should be taken to ensure that assets are not misappropriated, loaned to others, or sold or donated, without appropriate authorization.
ePlus will take appropriate steps, including legal measures, to protect its assets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You have an obligation to care for and protect the equipment that has been provided to you.
If you use ePlus equipment at your home or off site, you must take precautions to protect it from theft or damage, just as if it were your own.
If you leave ePlus employment, you must immediately return all Company-owned equipment.&nbsp.
How To Report Possible Violations Every employee has a responsibility to promptly report any issue or concern he believes, in good faith, may constitute a violation of the Code or any other ePlus Policy.
We also encourage you to come forward if you encounter a situation that “just doesn’t feel right.”&nbsp.
Your commitment to take action to share your concerns will help to ensure an ethical workplace for everyone.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You should report suspicions to only those people who absolutely need to know.
This protects people from allegations that may not be proven and prevents the possible destruction of evidence.
The Company does not allow retaliation for reports made in good faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You have several options available for voicing you concerns:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Start by talking with your immediate manager.
ePlus managers have a duty to promote an open and honest environment where members of their teams can feel comfortable about voicing their concerns without fear of retaliation.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If you do not feel comfortable discussing your concern with your manager, or after seeking assistance you do not feel the outcome resolved your issue, please contact a Human Resources representative.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If you do not feel comfortable with either of the first two options, or after seeking assistance, you do not feel the issue was appropriately addressed or resolved, please contact the Chief Financial Officer or the General Counsel.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In addition to the options already listed, you can submit comments or concerns via the Company’s internal web-based communication channel “VOICE IT”.
VOICE IT submissions are received by HR and the General Counsel.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Also, ePlus has retained the services of an external provider, to manage a confidential Whistleblower Hotline for ePlus employees.
The Hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Your concern will be documented by the third party.
An independent ePlus Board member, the General Counsel and the Vice President of Human Resources receive details of all ePlus-related calls made, directly from the third-party provider.</li>
</ul>
Non-ePlus employees should contact the Company’s main telephone number (703) 984-8400 or 888-482-1122.
The call will then be directed to the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, or the Investor Relations Department.
