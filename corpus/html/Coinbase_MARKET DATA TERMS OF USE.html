<strong>Ownership and Proprietary Rights.</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Market Data.</strong> You acknowledge that as between Coinbase and you, the Market Data and all rights in the Market Data (including all copyrights, database rights, and all other proprietary rights) are exclusively the property of Coinbase.
In addition and independently of the foregoing, you acknowledge that the Market Data is the product of substantial expenditure by Coinbase of labor, skill, and money, and your use of Market Data in contravention of these Terms would misappropriate the benefits of those expenditures.
Coinbase reserves all rights in the Market Data not expressly granted in these Terms.
At the request and expense of Coinbase, you agree that you will take all reasonable steps, such as the execution of written documents, that may be necessary to protect, perfect, and enforce Coinbase's rights in the Market Data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Equitable Relief.</strong> Without limiting any other rights of Coinbase under these Terms, the parties recognize that a breach of the restrictions applicable herein to the use of Market Data would give rise to irreparable injury to Coinbase such that monetary damages alone would not be an adequate remedy.
You and Coinbase agree that in the event of such a breach, Coinbase will be entitled to equitable relief, including in the form of injunctive relief, and you hereby waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or the showing that actual monetary damages will not afford an adequate remedy in connection with seeking such relief.</li>

<strong>Changes to Market Data and Suspension of Access.</strong> Coinbase may from time to time, without notice and in its sole discretion, withdraw, suspend, or change the Market Data or your access to the Market Data.

<p>
<strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Coinbase Protected Parties will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind—including lost profits or trading losses—related to the market data or these Terms, irrespective of whether such damages arise from claims brought in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, strict liability, or any other theory at law or equity, and even if Coinbase has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Coinbase Protected Parties' aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of Market Data exceed <strong>USD$1,000</strong>.

<strong>Choice of Law.</strong> You agree that the laws of the State of New York--without regard to any of its choice-of-law principles that would apply the substantive laws of any other jurisdiction--will govern these Terms and any claim or dispute that may arise between you and Coinbase, except to the extent governed by federal law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration.
Waiver of Class Action.</strong> If you have a dispute with Coinbase, we will attempt to resolve any such disputes through our support team.
If we cannot resolve the dispute through our support team, you and Coinbase agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf) and you and Coinbase hereby expressly waive trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement or misappropriation of a party's proprietary rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, database rights, patents, and fruits of labor, skill, or money protected under common law principles of unfair competition.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language.
The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys' fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court.
At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings.
The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees.
If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court.
We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law.
Apart from the foregoing, each party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the party may incur.</p>
</li>
<li>

<strong>Assignment and Delegation.</strong> You may not assign or delegate any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone without Coinbase's prior written consent, and any assignment in violation of this paragraph will be null and void.
Coinbase may freely assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, including in connection with any merger, acquisition or asset sale.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of You and Coinbase, and your and Coinbase's respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Severability.</strong> In the event any part of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, you and Coinbase authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to make the modifications that are necessary to comply with existing law, in a manner most closely representing the original intent of Coinbase and you as expressed in these Terms.</p>
