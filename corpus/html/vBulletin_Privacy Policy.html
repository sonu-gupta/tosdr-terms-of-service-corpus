<p>13.2 How to Access, Change, or Remove Your PHI</p>
<p>Subject to certain exceptions, HIPAA establishes rights with respect to your PHI.
These rights generally include the right to restrict the uses and disclosures of your PHI, the right to access and receive a copy of your PHI, the right to amend your PHI, and the right to receive an accounting of the disclosures of your PHI.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact your healthcare provider.</p>
