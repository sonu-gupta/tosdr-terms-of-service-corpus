<li>Measure and analyze the audience for each page in order to subsequently improve the ergonomics, browsing, or visibility of content;</li>
<li>Measure the reliability of its Site by analyzing the number of visits to its pages in real time, and offer varied ads that are adapted to users’ areas of interest;</li>
