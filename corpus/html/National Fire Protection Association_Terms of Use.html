<strong>Digital Millenium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Notice and Procedure
<br>
<br>
</strong>Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement in Accordance with DMCA.&nbsp.
In accordance&nbsp.
with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which may be found on the U.S.
Copyright Office website at http://www.copyright.gov), NFPA will respond expeditiously to clear&nbsp.
notices of alleged copyright infringement that are reported to NFPA’s&nbsp.
designated copyright agent identified below.
As part of our response, we may remove or disable access to material residing on a site that is controlled or operated by NFPA that is claimed to be infringing, in which case we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the person who submitted the affected material so that they may make a counter notification, also in accordance with the DMCA.&nbsp.
The following section describes the information that should be present in these notices.&nbsp.
Notice of Infringing Material.&nbsp.
If you are a copyright owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of an owner of the copyright or of any exclusive right under the copyright, and believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please report your notice of infringement to NFPA by providing NFPA’s designated copyright agent listed below with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>
<li>Identify the material that you claim is infringing the copyrighted work listed above and that is to be removed or access disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit NFPA&nbsp.
to locate the material;</li>
<li>Provide information reasonably sufficient to allow NFPA&nbsp.
to contact you, including a name, address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
<li>If possible, provide information sufficient to allow NFPA&nbsp.
to notify the owner/administrator of the allegedly infringing content;</li>
<li>Include the following statements: <ul>
<li>“I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”</li>
<li>“I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sign the notice;</li>
<li>Send the notice to:</li>

<strong>Counter Notification<br>
<br>

an affected site or the provider of affected content may make a counter&nbsp.
notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium&nbsp.

<li>Include the following statement: <ul>
<li>“I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I&nbsp.
have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or&nbsp.

been removed or disabled and will no longer be shown.”</li>
