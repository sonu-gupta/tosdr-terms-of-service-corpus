Pending the determination of such claim, Canva may withhold from royalties and/or other compensation due to you hereunder, such sums as are reasonably related to the probable value of the claim as determined by Canva.</p>
<p>Canva takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts, publishes&nbsp;or prints over or using the Service.
You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing and printing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content.
You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content or Stock Media that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Canva shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content, Stock Media or your use of either in printed form.
In the event that your User Content is alleged to be offensive, inappropriate for children, unlawful or otherwise in breach of these terms, you agree that Canva may disclose such User Content to&nbsp;law enforcement or other government authorities.</p>
4.3 User Content on Canva Print
<p>In some countries, you may be eligible to order prints of your User Content on Canva Print, as part of the Services.
Your use of Canva Print is subject to these terms.</p>

You agree to hold harmless Canva and its third party suppliers for any loss, cost or expense that you incur&nbsp;in connection with your use of Canva Print.</p>
<p>By printing User Content on Canva Print, you agree to take steps to verify that the User Content does not contain or consist of anything that is prohibited under these terms or is otherwise unlawful.&nbsp;You agree that this is not the responsibility of Canva or its third party suppliers, despite Canva and its third party suppliers having the right to refuse your order (which right you acknowledge).</p>

Basically, if you can’t upload or publish something on Canva, you can’t print it using Canva Print.

</p>

Governing Law
<p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California.
and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Canva, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.
This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.
If you are a consumer, this agreement does not exclude any rights you may have under the national consumer laws of your jurisdiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These terms are governed by the laws of California but don’t exclude your rights under national consumer law.
If we need to enforce our Intellectual Property Rights against you, you agree to have the issue resolved only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California.</p>
</blockquote> 19.
Arbitration.
<p>For any dispute with Canva, you agree to first contact us at support@canva.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
In the unlikely event that Canva has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Canva claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.
The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Canva agree otherwise.
Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.
The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.
<strong>All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims.
You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Canva are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have any disagreements, contact us first.
We’re decent people, but if we can’t work it out, then you agree to submit the dispute to arbitration in Santa Clara County, California (except in certain circumstances relating the protection of Intellectual Property Rights.)</p>
</blockquote> 20.
