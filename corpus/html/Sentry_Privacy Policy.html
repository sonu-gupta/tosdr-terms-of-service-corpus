information.
We offer the use of a secure server.
All supplied sensitive/credit
information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then
encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by
those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to
keep the information confidential.
After a transaction, your private information
(e.g., credit cards, social security numbers, financials) will not be stored on
our servers.
For more information, please review our Security &amp.
Compliance
Policy.</p>How do we ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available?<p>We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing systems remain
confidential, resilient, and available.
Specifically, we have implemented
processes to help ensure high availability, business continuity, and prompt
disaster recovery.
We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access
controls, and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address
potential vulnerabilities.</p>Learn more<p>
<strong>High Availability</strong>.
Every part of the Services utilize properly-provisioned,
redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica
databases) in case of failure.
We take servers out of operation as part of
regular maintenance, without impacting availability.</p>
<p>
<strong>Business Continuity</strong>.
We keep encrypted backups of data every hour in
multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform.
While never expected, in the case of
production data loss (i.e., primary data stores loss), we will restore
organizational data from these backups.</p>
<p>
<strong>Disaster Recovery</strong>.
In the event of a region-wide outage, we will bring up a
duplicate environment in a different Google Cloud Platform region.
Our
operations team has extensive experience performing full region migrations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Physical Access Controls</strong>.
Sentry is hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
Google
data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards
such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access
barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics.
According to the
Google Security Whitepaper: “The data center floor features laser beam intrusion
detection.
Data centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution interior and
exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders.
Access logs, activity
records, and camera footage are reviewed in case an incident occurs.
Data
centers are also routinely patrolled by professional security guards who have
undergone rigorous background checks and training.” Sentry employees do not
have physical access to Google data centers, servers, network equipment, or
storage.</p>
<p>
<strong>Logical Access Controls</strong>.
Sentry is the assigned administrator of its
infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Sentry
operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an
as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network.
Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored
in a secure and encrypted location.</p>
<p>
<strong>Penetration Testing</strong>.
We engage an independent, third-party agency to perform
black box penetration testing on an annual basis.
Information about security
vulnerabilities that are successfully exploited through penetration testing is
then used to set mitigation and remediation priorities.
If you are a customer on
one of our “Enterprise” plans, we will provide a summary of penetration test
findings to you upon request.</p>
<p>
<strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>.
Unusual network patterns or suspicious
behavior are among Sentry’s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and
management.
Google Cloud Platform’s intrusion detection and prevention systems
(IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help
identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods.
IDS/IPS
involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface,
employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing
and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as
well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place.
We do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide
access to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any
unscheduled downtime.</p>

single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, and to
count users who have visited those websites.
We may also include web beacons in
our promotional email messages or newsletters, to determine whether and when you
open and act on them.</p>
<p>In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with
other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their
advertisements.
This helps us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an
advertisement on a Sentry website results in a purchase or other action on the
advertiser’s website.</p>
<p>Finally, our Services may contain web beacons or similar technologies from
third-party analytics providers that help us compile aggregated statistics about
the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations.
These
technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or
other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information
about your online activities across applications, websites or other products.
However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our
sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as
your name or email address).&nbsp;</p>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?<p>We share your personal data with your consent, or as necessary to provide the

cases, these companies are required to abide by our data privacy and security
requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for
any other purpose.</p>

Services, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill
the purposes outlined in the policy.
You can ask to close your account by
contacting us at the details above, and we will delete your personal
information on request.</p>
<p>We may, however, retain personal information for an additional period as is
permitted or required under applicable laws, for legal, tax, or regulatory
reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.</p>Learn more<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide the
Services to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our
legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
Because
these needs can vary for different types of data in the context of the
different Services we provide, actual retention periods can vary significantly.
The criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>How long is the personal data needed to provide the Services and/or operate
our business?</em> This includes such things such as maintaining and improving the
performance of the Services, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining
appropriate business and financial records.
This is the general rule that
establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Is there an automated control, such as in your privacy dashboard, that
enables you to access and delete the personal data at any time?</em> If there is
not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</em> If so, a shortened retention time
would generally be appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</em> If so, we will
retain the data in accordance with your consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Is Sentry subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain
the data?</em> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the
applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an
investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.</p>
