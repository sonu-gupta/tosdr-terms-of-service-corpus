</ul> About intellectual property
<p>Intellectual property refers to something produced as the result of creativity.
This includes tangible and intangible works, such as books, text, code, images, videos, logos, and slogans.
Copyright and trademark are two types of intellectual property.</p>
<p>Store owners need to protect their intellectual property, and make sure that they don't infringe on someone else's intellectual property.</p>
<p>
</p>
About copyright
<p>Copyright protects tangible original works, such as photos on an online store.
</p>
<p>Copyright laws vary by country or region, but generally copyright applies from the time the work is created.
In many countries or regions, copyrights can also be registered with the government’s copyright office.
</p>
<p>A copyright owner has the exclusive rights to copy, display, distribute, sell, or perform their works, or to create derivative works.
A copyright owner controls how their works are used, and others who want to use their works need to get their permission.
If someone uses copyrighted works without permission from the owner, then they might be infringing on the copyright.</p>
<p>Learn more about copyright on the U.S.
Copyright Office website or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office's Guide to copyright.</p>
<p>
</p>
About trademarks
<p>Trademarks protect unique symbols or words that identify and distinguish a business or product from other businesses or products.
</p>
<p>Once registered, a trademark has certain protections under the law, and the trademark owner has the exclusive rights to use the claimed trademark for certain products or services.
If someone uses a trademark without permission in a way that causes confusion about the brand, product or services, then they might be infringing on a trademark.</p>

Dropshipping and intellectual property
<p>If you dropship products, then you can choose which products, services, and suppliers you work with.
You should also consider the risks because some suppliers might list copyrighted, branded or trademarked goods.

<ul>

Copyright policy
<p>It is Shopify’s policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the text of which can be found at the U.S.
Copyright Office website, https://www.copyright.gov.</p>
<p>It is expected that all users of any part of Shopify will comply with applicable copyright laws.
If, however, we receive proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to such notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating the user’s account.</p>
<p>In accordance with Section 512(i)(1)(a) of the DMCA, Shopify will, in appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.</p>
<p>
</p>
Reporting copyright infringement
<p>You can sign in to use the online form to report content on Shopify that you believe violates or infringes your copyright.
</p>
<p>You can also report multiple stores that are infringing on the same copyrighted works in a single form submission.
If you falsely report that content infringes on your copyright, then you might be liable for damages.</p>
