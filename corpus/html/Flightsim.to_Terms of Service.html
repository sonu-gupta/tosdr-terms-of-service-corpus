If you upload User Content that includes another party's copyright or intellectual property, any terms of the third-party content's End User License Agreement (EULA) shall take precedence over these terms to the extent of any conflict.
For the sake of clarity, in no event do you grant us any right or interest in anyone's intellectual property or anyone's copyright.
The license grant is limited to distribution licenses and any licenses that are necessary to enable such distribution.</p>
<p>
<strong>(4.3)</strong>&nbsp;When you submit or post User Content to the Service, either directly or through a Third Party Service, you are granting this Site a worldwide, non-exclusive, assignable, unrestricted, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable, and royalty-free license to use the User Content.

<strong>(P-2) </strong>Your Flightsim.to Premium Membership begins with our acceptance of your purchase.
Our acception will take place when we email you to accept it, at which point a contract will come into existence between you and us.
If we are unable to accept your purchase, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for the purchase.
You will have access to the Premium Membership benefits once you have paid the relevant purchase fee in full after our acceptance, for the period you selected during purchase.</p>
<p>
<strong>(P-3)</strong> We reserve the right to modify the Premium Membership in order to: (a) comply with changes in applicable laws and regulations, and (b) incorporate minor technical enhancements and improvements, such as addressing security concerns.
These changes will not have an impact on your use of the Premium Membership.</p>
<p>
<strong>(P-4) </strong>We cannot be held accountable for any delays or service interruptions that are beyond our control.
If access to the Premium Membership is delayed or interrupted due to circumstances beyond our control, we will notify you as soon as possible and take steps to minimize the impact of the delay or interruption.
In such cases, we will not be responsible for the delay or interruption, but if there is a substantial risk of a prolonged delay or interruption, you have the option to end your Membership and receive a refund for any Premium Membership fees that you have already paid but have not yet received.</p>
<p>
<strong>(P-5)</strong> Suspension.
The Premium Membership ends at the end of the day on which the period for which you purchased Flightsim.to Premium ends.

It is not necessary to cancel your membership separately.
The membership expires automatically.
If you wish to continue using Flightsim.to Premium after your initial chosen period, you must purchase it again.</p>
<p>
<strong>(P-5.1)</strong> We may end your Membership if you break any of these terms or any other terms which apply to the Website.

<p>
<strong>(P-6) </strong>You may have a statutory right of withdrawal.
You may be able to withdraw from your purchase within 14 days if you change your mind.
You need to contact and inform us of this decision within the withdrawal period.
However, you are obligated to compensate us for the Premium Membership benefits utilized until the point at which you inform us of your change of decision, which is, for every day of the Premium Membership period, you must pay 5% of the Membership fee.
If you are entitled to a refund, we will pay this to you by the method you used for payment.
However, we may make deductions from the price, as described above.</p>
<p>
<strong>(P-6.1) </strong>Other than legally provided reasons for revocation or withdrawal, we do not recognize any other refund or return rights, unless required by law.</p>

It is forbidden to pass on access data to other persons and this contract is only effective between you as the purchaser of the Premium Membership and us.
You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else.
Unlawful or forbidden sharing of the Premium Membership with any third party without our prior consent is a breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate termination.</p>
<p>
<strong>(P-8)</strong> We are responsible for any foreseeable losses or damages caused by us in the provision of the Premium Membership.
If we breach these terms or fail to exercise reasonable care and skill, we are liable for the foreseeable losses or damages that result, but not for those that are not foreseeable.
Loss or damage is considered foreseeable if it was either evident or known to both parties at the time the agreement was made.
There are some instances where our liability cannot be limited or excluded, such as in cases of death or personal injury caused by our negligence or that of our employees, agents, or subcontractors, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or violation of your legal rights related to the Premium Membership.
We are not responsible for losses incurred in the course of conducting business.
The Premium Membership is intended for personal and domestic use only, and if used for commercial or business purposes, we will not be liable for any loss of profit, business interruption, or opportunity.</p>

Terms of the Flightsim.to Creators Program&nbsp.
<p>
<strong>(C-1) </strong>This Section describes the terms and conditions for the Creators Program at Flightsim.to.
Where this a conflict between the Website Terms and Conditions and the terms in this Section, these terms shall prevail.
Please read these terms carefully before you opt-in to Flightsim.to Creators Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-2) </strong>The Flightsim.to Creators Program&nbsp;provides content creators at Flightsim.to the opportunity to “opt-in” in order to receive donations from other users through Flightsim.to, and rewards based upon certain metrics that Flightsim.to determines at its sole discretion.&nbsp;It is important to emphasize that donations made directly to the creators through platforms such as PayPal or Buy Me a Coffee are excluded from the scope of the Creators Program and these terms.
The Creators Program is a selective program that requires an application process and is open only to approved Creators.
For example, it allows users to buy credit on Flightsim.to, and then spend that credit on donations to Creators.</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-3)</strong>&nbsp;In order to apply for the Creators Program, you must be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> and possess an active Flightsim.to account that has published at least three mods with a total download count of at least<strong>
</strong>10,000 downloads.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is only a basic guideline from which Flightsim.to may deviate at its sole discretion.
There is no claim for inclusion in the Flightsim.to Creators Program.
To make a mod eligible for our&nbsp.
Creators Program, it must be opted-in through the Mod Reward management page.
If you are a part of a team of mod creators, you may register on behalf of the team, but you will be solely responsible for dividing any earnings among your team members.
We will not be involved in the distribution of earnings between team members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-4)</strong>
<strong>
</strong>For a mod to be eligible for the Creators Program, it must meet one of the following requirements: (a) it must consist solely of your original work, (b) it must consist of your original work and / or assets that have been cleared for general commercialization, (c) it must consist of the above and/or assets that are not your original work and not licensed for general commercialization, but for which you have obtained explicit permission from the asset authors to use for such commercial use case.</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-5)</strong>&nbsp;Earnings may be acquired in various ways, which are subject to change at the discretion of Flightsim.to, including, but not limited to: (1) unique downloads of your mods over a specified time frame.
(2) a portion of credits from other users who choose to share with you.
(3) participating in contests or promotions that offer Earnings as a reward.
(4) engaging in other activities that allow such earnings.
Flightsim.to has sole discretion over: (a) how Earnings are earned.
(b) the amount of Earnings earned from each activity.
and (c) the timing of the distribution of such Earnings, if any, to you.
Flightsim.to reserves the right to add or remove methods of earning or to discontinue the Creators Program, for any reason or no reason at all.</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-6)</strong> You acknowledge and agree that your participation in the Creators Program does not guarantee the earning anything.
Flightsim.to makes no representations, warranties or guarantees that you will receive any Earnings through your participation in the Creators Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-7)</strong>&nbsp;To redeem your earnings, you must have a linked PayPal account in your Flightsim.to account and have sufficient Earnings to withdraw the specified amount.
That means, your Earnings must at least exceed 25.00,- USD.
Cash redemptions are only available in United States Dollars (USD($)) and can only be redeemed in whole numbers.
The conversion of USD($) to your local currency will be handled by PayPal, and Flightsim.to will not be responsible for any fees incurred from PayPal's services.
It is your responsibility to ensure that your PayPal email is entered correctly.
If a PayPal withdrawal is unavailable due to PayPal's national or other restrictions, no alternative cash payout will be offered and your earnings will be refunded to your account.
It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you have all the necessary requirements for withdrawal of earnings before joining the Creators Program.
All payouts are considered final and are not refundable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-8)</strong> Upon acceptance into the Creators Program, you are required to furnish us with personal information, including but not limited to your full name, address, country of residence, and tax identification number, if applicable.
You represent and warrant to us that the information provided is current, accurate, and complete and agree to keep such information up to date during the course of your membership in the Creators Program.
We reserve the right to verify the accuracy of the information against official documents, such as your identification or passport, and you agree to promptly provide us with proof of such information if requested.</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-9) </strong>In accordance with applicable laws, any applicable tax rate shall be imposed on your payout.
You are solely responsible for complying with all tax reporting requirements and for paying the appropriate tax to the relevant governmental entities in accordance with the law.

<p>
<strong>(C-10)</strong>&nbsp;Under no circumstances shall we be held accountable for any theft or loss of your earnings, even if your account has been compromised.
If you are in violation of these terms or any terms applicable to the Website, or if you are in breach of contract, you will lose access to the Creators Program and all your earnings without compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-11)&nbsp;</strong>The act of manipulating or exploiting the Creators Program system to gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited.

Any actions taken with the intention of manipulating the system, such as using assets without permission to earn, repeatedly releasing minor updates for mods as separate mod pages to increase earnings, creating fraudulent accounts to boost unique downloads, or any other activities deemed to be an abuse of the system by Flightsim.to staff, will not be tolerated.
The staff and moderation team have the discretion to determine if such actions violate the Terms of Service or rules of the Creators Program system.</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-12)&nbsp;</strong>Please note that participation in the Creators Program system is a privilege and not a right.
Flightsim.to reserves the right to modify, discontinue, or terminate the Creators Program at any time, with or without notice.&nbsp;In addition to your indemnification obligations set forth in the Terms of Service, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Flightsim.to and related parties harmless from any claim, demand, damages, or other losses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, asserted by any third-party resulting from or arising out of any breach by you of these rules.&nbsp;Flightsim.to reserves the right to, with or without notifying you, temporarily or permanently exclude you or your mods from the Creators Program, and/or withhold or erase Earnings you may have already accumulated for acting in violation of these rules.
Flightsim.to shall not be liable to you or any third-party for termination of your access to the Creators Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>(C-13) </strong>Flightsim.to contributes to the Creators Program at its own discretion and you are not entitled to Earnings or rewards.
The ability to earn through the Creators Program is a privilege we provide to you on a voluntary basis, and we do not guarantee the system to remain live for an indefinite amount of time or our contributions to the Creators Program to remain consistent.</p>
