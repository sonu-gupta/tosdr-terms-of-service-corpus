</ul>
<p>When we use words like "us", "we", "our" we mean GameAnalytics.
You can find our company details below.
We are the data controller of the data collected through the use of cookies on our website.
</p>
<p>Our website is https://gameanalytics.com, incl.
our sub-domains, we own and operate.
</p>
<p>When we refer to "you" we mean you as a user or visitor of our website.</p>
<p>This policy is part of our privacy policy.
Our use of cookies may include processing of your personal data and we therefore recommend that you read our privacy policy, which can be found here https://gameanalytics.com/privacy/.
</p>
<p>
<b>Consent</b>
</p>
<p>Where you have consented to our use of cookies through the consent banner, apart from necessary cookies, you consent to our use of cookies as described under "Types of cookies and how we use them" below.
You may at any time change or withdraw your cookie consent - See the section "How you can change your cookie settings, incl.
opting out" below.
</p>
<p>
<b>What do I need to know about cookies?</b>
</p>
<p>There are different types of cookies and they are used for different purposes.
</p>
<p>Below you can read about what a cookie is, the difference between first and third party cookies and session cookies vs.
persistent cookies and what types of cookies we use on our website and why.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is a cookie?</b>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit it and which is then read when you later revisit the site.
The word "cookies" in this policy and the consent also refers to other forms of automatic collection of data, e.g.
Flash-cookies (Local Shared Objects), Web Storage (HTML5), Javascripts or cookies placed by other software.
</p>
<p>A cookie may contain information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when you return to the website, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>
<p>The word "cookies" or "cookie data" also covers information about IP and MAC addresses and other information about your device collected by said technologies.</p>
<p>Cookies are used to enable certain features (e.g.
logging in), to track site usage (e.g.
analytics), to store your user settings (e.g.
timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (e.g.
advertising, language).</p>
<p>
<b>Session cookies vs.
persistent cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Session cookies only last as long as your online session.
This means that they will disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser.
They are therefore also sometimes referred to as temporary cookies.
Typically, session cookies are used to remember what a user put in their basket when they are browsing a website.
</p>
<p>Persistent cookies are different.
These cookies are sometimes called permanent cookies.
They will stay on your computer or device after you close your browser.
These types of cookies will expire according to the time specified in the cookie.
You can see the specific duration of each persistent cookie below.
</p>
<p>
<b>What’s the difference between first and third party cookies?</b>
</p>
<p>First party cookies are cookies that are set by the website that you are visiting and it's only this website that can access and read these cookies.
</p>
<p>Third party cookies are set by someone other than the owner of the website you’re visiting.
As an example, some pages have content from other sites like YouTube.
YouTube may set their own cookies on your browser when you play the video from YouTube.
Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e.
third parties) can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>
<p>We may engage third parties to assist with maintenance, operation, creation or functionality of our website, e.g.
analytics providers and content partners.
We grant these third parties’ access to selected information to perform specific tasks on our behalf.
</p>
<p>We are, as a general rule, joint controller with providers of third-party cookies for the collection of personal data via such cookies and the disclosure to the provider.
The provider of third-party cookies is data controller for the processing taking place after receiving the personal data from us.
You can read more about the extent of our joint controllership with providers of third-party cookies in our privacy policy.</p>
<p>We recommend reading the provider's privacy policy which can be found through links in the tables below, where you can also see which cookies on our website are first party cookies and third-party cookies.
</p>
<b>Types of cookies and how we use them</b>
<p>
<b>Necessary cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Necessary cookies are required for the basic functionality of our website to work.

The cookies also help keep track of, if, and when, you gave consent to analytical cookies, T&amp;Cs and email marketing.</p>
<p>Necessary cookies are also used for payment processing.
</p>
<p>It's not necessary to accept nor possible to reject the use of necessary cookies as they are core for the functionality of our website.

To put the size of comScore into some context, its factsheet claims it tracks more than three million unique websites worldwide and its methodology page says it has "approximately two million worldwide consumers under continuous measurement".
It provides market research data to website owners through a mixture of online surveys and the use of web beacons.
According to comScore, websites elect to take part in the company's market research.
The website owners place ScorecardResearch web beacons into the pages of their website.
When a browser loads a page that contains a ScorecardResearch web beacon, a cookie will be set.
This, says comScore, allows it to observe "browser-level" behaviour, i.e.
how often you return to a website or if, having visited one website, you go to another one that is related.
The data that is collected is used to build up reports on internet behaviour and trends.</p> Read cookie provider's privacy policy Name Expiry Domain Type UID 720 days .scorecardresearch.com Cookie Name Expiry Domain Type UIDR 720 days .scorecardresearch.com Cookie Twitter <p>Twitter is a social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as tweets.
