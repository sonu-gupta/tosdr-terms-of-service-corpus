INFORMATION HINDSIGHT MAY COLLECT <p>Personal Data is generally defined as information that, alone or in combination with other information, could identify, relate to, describe, reference, or reasonably could be associated with a particular individual, directly or indirectly.
To provide some examples, depending on where you live, categories of Personal Data other businesses collect can include, but are not limited to, an individual’s name, address, phone number, email address, username and password, IP address, information specifically tied to an IP address such as browser or device information or other persistent online identifiers, browsing or search history, credit/debit card number or other financial information, professional or employment-related information, office address and other business information, demographic information, biometric information such as fingerprints, precise location information, or any other type of information that, directly or indirectly, is reasonably capable of being associated with you.</p> 2.1 Client Information <p>Hindsight may collect certain Personal Data and other information directly from our Clients.
For example, Hindsight will collect a Client’s contact details when a Client enters a contractual relationship with Hindsight and we will collect a password or other account access credentials when a Client creates a Hindsight account.
When a Client sends us an email asking a question we will collect the information, including any Personal Data, that the Client provides in the email.
We will also collect any Personal Data and other information that Clients choose to provide to us, such as any information contained in a message or form that a Client submits through our Site or via email.
We may also collect Personal Data and other information from prospective Clients through publicly available sources.
When using the Site, the Personal Data and other information Hindsight may collect includes your name, company name, business email address, and/or information associated with your Internet protocol (IP) address such as your browser, device, and location information to the extent such information is reasonably capable of identifying or being associated with you.</p> 2.2 User Information <p>When Users interact with Hindsight Services that appear on our Clients’ websites and other third-party properties online, Hindsight may automatically collect certain information based on the IP address associated with the User’s computer, device, or browser.
Such User information generally is not capable of being linked back to any specific individual and includes, but it not limited to, information about a User’s device and operating system, the web pages accessed by Users within our Clients’ websites, the link that led a User to a Client’s website, the dates and times a User accesses a Client’s website, event information (e.g., system crashes), general location information (e.g., city and state), hashed email addresses (when made available by the User), and gender (when made available by the User).
To whatever extent such automatically collected User information is reasonably capable of identifying you or being associated with you, we will refer to it as device information and treat it as Personal Data.
Hindsight requests that Clients obtain any necessary consent on our behalf where required to do so by applicable data protection laws and regulations, in order for Hindsight to collect this User Information.</p> 3.
HOW HINDSIGHT GATHERS INFORMATION <p>If you are a Client, we may collect Personal Data when you register an account for the Services, visit or use certain areas of the Site, submit questions, comments or other feedback through the “Contact Us” form on the Site, or voluntarily provide Personal Data to us in any other way.</p>
<p>If you are a User, we may collect other data in an automated manner whenever you visit our Clients’ websites and other online properties and interact with our Services, such as device information that may be Personal Data to the extent it is reasonably capable of identifying you.
For example, when you access or use the Services, we and third parties that may provide certain functionality on or through the Services may engage, receive, collect, and store certain device information and other online identifiers through automatic data collection tools such as embedded web links and similar technology.
These technologies may collect information including, but not limited to, your IP address, browser type, the date and time that you use the Services, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, unique identifiers related to your browser, and information about your device.
This device information generally cannot be associated with you or other individuals, but if there is reason to believe that any device information could be linked to you, we will treat it as Personal Data.</p>
<p>The Services use such automatic data collection tools to serve relevant ad experiences to Users.
Your browser may allow you to block, delete or otherwise disable these tools.
However, if you disable them, the Services may not work properly.</p> 4.

</ul> 4.2 User Information If you are a User that interacts with our Services on or through one of our Client’s websites or other third-party properties online, we use your Personal Data to provide our Services as necessary or in accordance with our legitimate interests in performance of our contractual obligations with our Clients, including:

or</li>

</ul> 5.
PROCESSING BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS <p>Hindsight and certain third parties that provide services on our behalf will collect, process and use your Personal Data as described in this Policy and for the purposes set forth in this Policy.</p>

<p>We may use and share any information, including Personal Data, that we receive with vendors and service providers retained as necessary for business purposes and other legitimate interests in connection with Hindsight’s provision of the Services.

Upon the written request of a law enforcement entity to preserve a Client’s or User’s Personal Data, pending receipt of a request or demand for such Personal Data pursuant to the conditions listed above, Hindsight will retain the relevant records and evidence for ninety (90) days from the date of the preservation request by the law enforcement entity, renewable for another 90-day period following a renewed written request by the law enforcement entity.</p>
<p>If you are a User, when you interact with our Services on our Clients’ websites and other third-party properties, we may provide advertisements to you based on your recent browsing behavior across different Client websites, browsers, or devices.
For example, if you are viewing an article about a movie on one of our publisher Client’s sites, you may see an advertisement we provide that will feature information about tickets to movies in your area and include links to other articles or content about movies on the publisher’s site.</p>
<p>We adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Further, if you use multiple browsers or devices you will need to execute these opt-outs on each browser or device, and there is no guarantee the opt-outs will prevent all personalized or behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>By providing to Hindsight the Personal Data and other data referenced above, you agree that Hindsight may use such Personal Data and other data in accordance with the terms of this Policy.
We will not collect additional categories of Personal Data or use the Personal Data we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p> 6.

RIGHTS AND OTHER INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE <p>Some of our business partners and third-party vendors that provide services on our behalf may be based outside the European Economic Area (the “EEA,” which includes the European Union Member States, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (the “UK”) (collectively, the “EU”).</p>
<p>If you are located in the EU, you may have one or more of the following rights with regard to Hindsight’s collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data on or through the Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to request access to the Personal Data we hold about you;</li>
<li>The right to update and correct any inaccurate Personal Data Hindsight holds about you;</li>
<li>The right, in certain circumstances, to object or withdraw any consent for marketing activities where we are relying on your consent to process your Personal Data;</li>
<li>The right to request restriction of Hindsight’s processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances (for example, if you contest the accuracy of the data);</li>
<li>The right, in certain circumstances, to request the portability of Personal Data you provided to Hindsight.
and/or</li>
<li>The right, in certain circumstances, to request the erasure or deletion of Personal Data we have collected or maintain about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a User and would like to understand how you can exercise any of your rights with respect to your Personal Data to the extent it is maintained by Hindsight, please submit a data subject access request by emailing us at management@hindsightsolutions.net.
If you are a Client or work on behalf of a Client, you may submit a data subject access request to the same email address and identify your relationship to the applicable Client so that Hindsight may either respond with the relevant information or, if applicable, direct this request to, and cooperate with, your employer to respond.</p>
<p>Under applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations, Clients and Users located in the EU may have the right to lodge a complaint about Hindsight’s processing of your Personal Data with a supervisory authority.
In particular, such individuals may lodge a complaint in the Member State where the individual lives or works or where the alleged violation took place.</p>
<p>If you reside within the EU, we will seek your consent before using your Personal Data to serve you relevant content and materials based on your personal preferences, interests, location and other information that you provide to Hindsight in connection with your use of the Services.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EU, we may need to share your Personal Data with third parties in other countries to provide our Services.
This means that Personal Data collected within the EU could be transferred outside the EU.
For example, your Personal Data may be transferred outside the EU:</p>
<ul>
<li>To our offices located in the U.S.;</li>
<li>To services providers located outside of the EU.
and/or</li>
<li>Where there is an international dimension to the Services we are providing to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transfers of Personal Data of individuals in the EU are subject to special rules under applicable data protection laws and regulations.
This means we can only transfer Personal Data to a country outside the EU where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the European Commission has issued an ‘adequacy decision’ in relation to that country or international organization;</li>
<li>there are appropriate safeguards in place, together with enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects.
or</li>
<li>a specific exception applies under data protection law.</li>
</ul>
<p>To protect your Personal Data, the Services use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Data and other information stored on our Services.</p> 9.
YOUR CHOICES <p>Depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, if you would like to request the ability to access, review, edit, delete or have us properly dispose of any of the Personal Data that Hindsight collected about you, if you would like to opt-out of receiving further information from Hindsight, or limit what we share, or if you otherwise wish Hindsight to cease using your Personal Data in the manners specified in this Policy (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), you can do so by emailing us at management@hindsightsolutons.net or by calling us at 908 821 6865.</p>
<p>Any removal of content by Hindsight does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal in all places.
The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal, state or other applicable law may require maintenance of the content or information.
Hindsight will do its best to accommodate your request, but we cannot guarantee we can remove all Personal Data from the specified uses.
Therefore, please be as specific as possible in your request.
If the request relates to information that Hindsight needs to make certain Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use those Services properly moving forward.</p>
<p>Hindsight reserves the right to maintain proper business records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Data.</p>
<p>Hindsight is required to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Data.
If you have a password-protected account with us, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity.
For most other requests, Hindsight will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Data we store about you before responding to your request.</p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional emails from Hindsight, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send Hindsight a detailed email at management@hindsightsolutons.net.</p>
<p>Some browsers have a ”do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
Hindsight does not currently have the capability to process these kinds of technical requests.
To learn about ways to opt-out of certain kinds of tracking for targeted advertising purposes, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website.
Options you select are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising.</p> 10.
SECURING PERSONAL DATA <p>Hindsight implements, uses, and maintains industry standard technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help secure your non-public Personal Data from loss, unauthorized access or disclosure, both in storage and in transmission.
Hindsight protects any Personal Data or other information it collects from you using various technologies and safeguards, including Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”), which is an encrypted communication protocol, and Transport Layer Security, the successor protocol to SSL.
SSL and TLS are standard formats for transmitting secure data from your computer to Hindsight’s servers.
SSL and TLS work by using a private key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL and TLS connection.</p>
<p>While Hindsight takes the issue of protecting your Personal Data seriously, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose and/or transmit through the Services.
Hindsight cannot guarantee that information sent over the Internet is fully secure.
The transmitted information may be intercepted by others before it reaches Hindsight.
If you are concerned about sending information to Hindsight over the Internet, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements.
Hindsight is not responsible for the security of information transmitted online.</p> 11.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY <p>The Services are intended for individuals 16 years of age and older located in the United States.
Hindsight neither collects nor sells the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.</p>
<p>The Services are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, individuals under 16 years of age.
No one under the age of 16 is permitted to provide any information on or through the Services, and Hindsight does not knowingly collect any information from anyone under 16 years of age.
If you are under 16 years of age, DO NOT use or provide any information about yourself on or through the Services, and DO NOT interact with any of the Services or their features.
We do not and will not knowingly collect any information, including Personal Data, from any person under 16 years of age and Hindsight will take immediate steps to delete any such information if it is inadvertently received.
If Hindsight learns that we have received Personal Data from any person under 16 years of age, Hindsight will delete that information.
If you believe a person under 16 years of age used our Services without authorization in a way that Hindsight somehow received a persistent identifier such as a static IP address that is capable of identifying the person under 16, or any other information that could be considered Personal Data under applicable law, please contact us immediately at management@hindsightsolutons.net.
Again, any deletion by Hindsight does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the information in all places.
The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information.</p> 12.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS <p>Applicable California privacy legislation permits visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding Hindsight’s disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request to access such information, please contact Hindsight at management@hindsightsolutons.net.
Within thirty (30) days of receiving such a request, Hindsight will provide a list of the categories of Personal Data disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties.
This request may be made no more than once per calendar year.
