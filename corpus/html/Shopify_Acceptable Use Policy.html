         <p>Shopify is a commerce platform that provides the tools and technology for merchants to set up an online store and sell products and services on their own website, at physical retail locations, marketplaces and more.
While we believe the free and open exchange of ideas and products is a key tenet of commerce, there are some activities that are incompatible with Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone.
