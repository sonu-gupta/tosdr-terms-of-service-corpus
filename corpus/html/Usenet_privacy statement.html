<b>Use of data for fraud prevention purposes</b>

The data you enter when you place an order may be used to check for unusual orders (e.g.
simultaneous ordering of multiple goods to the same address using different customer accounts).
We have a fundamental legitimate interest in carrying out such checks.
The legal basis for the processing is Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
In order to prevent fraud, we employ the services of Kount Inc, 917 Lusk Street, Boise, Idaho 83706, USA (referred to hereinafter as “Kount”) to operate our website.
Kount collects and processes data using Cookies and other tracking technologies in order to ascertain the terminal used by the user and other data relating to use of the website.
No assignment to specific users takes place here.
Where IP addresses are collected by Kount, these are subject to immediate encryption.
Kount stores the data in a database for fraud prevention purposes.
Data sent by us to Kount relating to end terminals that have previously been used to commit or in an attempt to commit fraudulent activity is also stored in the database.
No assignment to particular users takes place here either.
When an order is placed on our website, we retrieve a risk assessment on the user’s terminal from Kount’s database.
This risk assessment on the likelihood of attempted fraud considers, among other things, whether the terminal has dialled in using different service providers, whether the terminal has a frequently changing georeference, how many transactions have been made via the terminal and whether it uses a proxy connection.
The legal basis for the processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
