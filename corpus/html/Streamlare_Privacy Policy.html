Information We May Collect You may post content to the Services without creating an account.
When you do this, our servers automatically collect certain technical information (“Technical Data”) about your use of the Services.
Technical Data is collected as follows: <br>
<b>(a) Log Data</b>.
Our servers automatically recognize and log visitors' IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), Internet service provider, browser type, computer platform, referring web site, date and time of access, links clicked through, and possibly other information as well.
<b>(b) Cookies</b>.
Depending on how you access the Services, we may use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications or similar technologies such as HTML 5 local storage that allow us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Services.
When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them).
For example, we may use cookies to store your preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit our Services.
Some of the cookies we use are associated with your account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.
Advertisers may also use cookies on our Services.
We have no access to or control over these cookies once our third-party advertisers have been given permission to set cookies.
This Policy only covers use of cookies by us, and does not cover use of cookies by any third-party advertiser.
<b>(c) Other Device and Contact Information</b>.
Certain features of the Services require access to your device's native phonebook and image storage applications (e.g., to find friends or to store a message in your photo gallery).
If you choose to find friends, the phone numbers in your device's native phonebook will be transmitted to our servers.
When you create an account with us, you may voluntarily provide us with certain information in addition to the Technical Data above which may include personally identifying information (“Account Information”).
<b>(d) Account Information</b>.
This may include, without limitation, your username, password, email address, profile photo or avatar, biographic information, comments, and any other information you may provide to us when you sign up or as you use the Services.
