<strong>Jackpocket is a courier service licensed by the New Jersey Lottery.
Please be warned that ordering New Jersey Lottery tickets through a courier service not licensed by the New Jersey Lottery may expose you to fraud or other illegal activity.</strong>
</p>
<p>Although Jackpocket is licensed by the New Jersey Lottery, it is a separate legal entity and is not a part of the New Jersey Lottery, and the New Jersey Lottery does not guarantee, nor have any liability, for courier customer activities.</p>
<p>
<strong>Avoid Lottery Scams</strong>
</p>
<p>This is a warning to all consumers about scammers who are sending false announcements regarding lottery prizes.</p>
<p>As part of the scam, an individual is contacted by phone, email, text message, or a letter from a scammer who is claiming that the recipient has won a prize with a state lottery.
Unless you hear from Jackpocket directly, this is a fraudulent claim and there is no such prize.
Federal law prohibits the sale or mailing of lottery tickets across state lines.
You may only order lottery tickets or set up a subscription in the state you are physically located.
Never respond to these communications and never provide information or send money to a scammer.</p>
<p>Warning Signs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Although Jackpocket has your contact information and knows that you have won, the New Jersey Lottery does NOT know who the winners are until they come forward with a winning ticket.
The New Jersey Lottery does not notify you, you will be notifying the New Jersey Lottery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither Jackpocket nor the New Jersey Lottery ever requires the payment of any money in order to claim a prize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one should ever send any money to pay any ‘processing fee’ or any other requested fee in order to claim a prize.
(see FAQ What happens if I win?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never deposit any check sent to you that is accompanied by a request that you send or wire money to cover processing or claiming fees.
The check that you’ve received is fraudulent and will bounce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never provide any personal or financial information to a scammer, especially Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and credit card numbers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Report the Scam</p>
<p>Report any attempted scam to the Federal Trade Commission at 1-877-FTC-HELP or at the FTC Consumer Information website.</p>
<p>For customers within New Jersey, contact the New Jersey Lottery's Security Unit immediately at (609) 599-6100.
The Security Unit takes these "lottery scams" very seriously, and looks into each particular "scam" in great detail.
Please submit the “scam” material you have received, along with as many details as possible (i.e.
instructions, your contact information, etc.).
You can forward this information to the Security Unit by email (publicinfo@lottery.state.nj.us), by fax (609) 599-5814, ATTN: Security Unit, or via regular mail to New Jersey Lottery.

A ticket, in order to be a validly issued ticket, shall be generated as set forth in subdivision (q) of section 5004.9 of this subchapter.
Ticket Issuance.
A draw game ticket is deemed validly issued at the time such ticket is generated by a lottery terminal authorized by the commission or when a registered ticketless transaction is effected and not when a request for order is made of a digital courier service or a ticket order is placed with an interactive sales agent."</p>
<p>By creating an account using the digital network of an interactive sales agent or of a digital courier service to place an order for lottery tickets, an interactive customer agrees:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to be bound by the commission's regulations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to release and hold harmless the interactive sales agent or digital courier service licensee, the State, and the commission from any liability related to an order for tickets placed through the digital network that is not completed before the drawing cutoff and never results in the generation of the tickets ordered through the digital network.
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that, in the event a dispute occurs as to whether a ticket generated to complete an order placed through a digital network would have been a winning ticket had the ticket purchase occurred and no prize is paid, the commission may, at the commission's option, replace the ticket with a ticket equal in value to the price paid for the ticket that is the subject of the dispute, which remedy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the claimant against the commission</p>

<p>
<strong>4.
Winning Ticket is a Bearer Instrument.</strong> Note that your ticket is a bearer instrument within the meaning of all applicable law, such that the holder of the ticket is presumed to be the owner of the ticket with all applicable rights in the ticket and its proceeds.
Therefore, if you obtain possession of your winning ticket, do not lose your ticket or allow others to possess your ticket.
Jackpocket attempts to mitigate this risk by placing the winning customer’s name on the back of the ticket following the ticket being deemed a winning ticket, however Jackpocket cannot be held responsible for any lost or stolen tickets or other tickets that, for whatever reason, are not in the winning customer’s possession.</p>

For claims that total more than $25,000, the JAMS Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees.

<li>
<p>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.
