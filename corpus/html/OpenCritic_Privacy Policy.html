<em>Effective September 2, 2021</em>
</p>
<p>Your privacy is extremely important to us, and so we’ve prepared this Privacy Policy to transparently explain how we collect, use, and share information we get through your interactions with OpenCritic.
This Privacy Policy does NOT govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call, email, write, or communicate with us through any other channel other than OpenCritic.
Given that the Internet is a global network, information that we collect and gather may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries other than the one in which you reside.</p>
<p>By using OpenCritic, you explicitly consent to such use of your information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>1.
Information We Automatically Collect<p>We automatically collect a lot of data as you use and navigate OpenCritic and associated services.
We do this to help us understand who our users are and how they interact with our services.
For example, each time you visit OpenCritic and associated services, we may automatically collect your IP address, browser, device operating system, access time, how you got to OpenCritic, what pages you visit, and what features and web elements you interact with.
We call this data “Usage Data.”</p>

We may also collect additional information about you when you interact with OpenCritic, including when you interact with offers such as advertisements.
We may also collect data during our direct interactions with you, such as when asking you to complete a survey, asking you to enter a promotion, or assisting you in the process of customer support.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s may be information that we allow you to display on your public profile.
This information includes information such as (but not limited to) your alias, hometown, bio, game reviews, and any other information that’s displayed in a public fashion tied to your account.

Hyper-boring paragraph about Google Analytics incoming (much legal jargon, handle it): Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles.
They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.

These companies may collect and use click stream information, browser information, time and duration information, and the subject of the advertisements viewed or clicked in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be useful and relevant to you.
These companies are likely to use cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags to collect this information.
