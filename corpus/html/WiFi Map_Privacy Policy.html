<p>About ads</p>
<p>WiFi Map LLC (“WiFi Map” or “we”) collects information about you when you install and use our mobile application (“App”) and through other interactions and communications you have with us.
This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our App or otherwise interact or communicate with us (each such person, a “User” or “you”).
If at any time you disagree with this Policy, you must refrain from installing our App, or, if you have already installed our App, refrain from using it and delete it.
By installing or using our App you consent to our collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p>The primary function of our App is crowdsourcing from our Users information about WiFi hotspots and making that information available to our Users to help them find and access hotspots.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we collect the geographical locations of hotspots, along with the names and addresses of the venues in which they are located.
For each hotspot, we collect its router IP (remote IP) address, BSSID, SSID, password rotection status and, as applicable, password.
By uploading the password for a hotspot through our App, you represent and warrant to us that you are the owner of the hotspot, or have been authorized by the owner of the hotspot to upload the password through our App.
If you are not the owner of a hotspot, and have not been authorized by the owner of that hotspot to upload the password through our App, you must not upload the password for that hotspot.
We also collect information about WiFi signal strength, horizontal and vertical accuracy, speed test information, captive portal mode and the times at which your mobile device is connected to a particular hotspot.</p>
<p>We use AppMetrics and Firebase to measure things such as the rate of requests, counting the number of user logins over time.</p>
<p>The hotspot data that we collect is made available to our other Users through our Apps.</p>
<p>We also collect information about Users and their mobile devices and networks.
When you install our App, and as you use our App, we collect (a) your email address, (b) your Google, Facebook, VK or other social networking profile, to the extent available, (c) your age range, (d) your country, language and time zone, (e) the make, model, operating system, resolution, device ID, advertisement ID and, if applicable, MAC address of your mobile device, (f) the name of your mobile carrier and speed test information about the performance of your mobile network and (g) the other applications installed on your mobile device.
While our App is installed on your mobile device, whether or not you are using our App, we regularly track your precise geographical location.
As you use our App, we collect your search queries, including cities and venues that you search for.</p>
<p>All User payments for the pay version of our App are handled through the portal established by the publisher of the operating system for the User’s mobile device (iOS App Store, Google Play, etc.) and we do not receive, process or store Users’ credit card information or other User payment information.</p>
<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent, and have various permission systems for obtaining your consent.
The iOS platform will alert you the first time our App wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request.
Android devices will notify you of the permissions that our App seeks before you first use the App, and by using the App you consent to those permissions.</p>

<p>When You Use Our VPN Service</p>
<p>
<strong>We only keep the following data associated with your account:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Total amount of bytes transferred in a 30 day period.</li>
<li>Timestamp of your last activity on our VPN network.</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is used to enforce free tier limitations, prevent abuse and weed out inactive accounts.</p>
<p>
<strong>The following data is NOT stored:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Source IP</li>
<li>Sites you visited</li>
<li>Historical record of VPN sessions</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>When You Are Actively Connected to a Server</strong>
<br>
For the duration of your connection the following is stored in server’s memory.</p>
<p>
<strong>This data is immediately discarded when you disconnect:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenVPN/IKEv2 username</li>
<li>Time of connection</li>
<li>Amount of data transferred</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>The following data is stored in a central location:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of parallel connections at any given time to prevent rampant abuse and account sharing.<br>
A counter is incremented that stores the total number of bytes downloaded/uploaded in a 30 day period.</li>
<li>Anything that is not mentioned above is not stored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our bespoke system eliminates the need to store data entirely.
This data resides only in server’s memory while you’re connected, and is immediately discarded by the VPN server when you disconnect.
Since it doesn’t get logged into a permanent database, there is nothing to delete.</p>
<p>
<strong>When You Sign Up</strong>
</p>
<p>We only require a username and password when you sign up to our service.
Email can be provided if you wish to be able to recover your password in case you forget it, as well as receive periodic service updates.</p>
<p>
<strong>User Data Requests</strong>
</p>
<p>Since we store the bare minimum for a customer to actually use our service, any request for user data would yield nothing of value.
As we do not store any historical logs on who used which IP address, and since IPs are shared by dozens/hundreds of people at any given moment, so we cannot tie any activity to a specific account.<br>
We may change this Policy from time to time by posting an updated version of this Policy on our website or through our App.
Your continued use of our App after any such update will constitute your consent to the changes.
We encourage you to periodically review this Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
