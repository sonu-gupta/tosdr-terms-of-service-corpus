<p>
<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
</p>
<p>You accept that TP-Link is not responsible for the risks you take
associated with links or connections to third-party applications or
services.
You understand that such third-party services may or may not
carry their own terms, conditions, privacy policies or other policies
that may or may not be related to the Services.
We encourage you to be
aware of such agreements when you connect third-party services to the
Services.
We cannot and do not have control over, nor do we assume any
responsibility or risk for content, accuracy, practices, opinions, or
policies of any third-party applications or services that you may be
exposed to when you interact with the Services.
Your interactions with
third-party organizations and/or individuals found on or through the
Services are solely between you and such organizations and/or
individuals.
You agree that we shall not be responsible for any
liability for any loss or damage associated with any such interactions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Sites</strong>
</p>
<p>The Services may link you to other sites on the Internet.
These sites
may contain information or material that some people may find
inappropriate or offensive.
These other sites are not under the control
of TP-Link, and you acknowledge that (whether or not such sites are
affiliated in any way with TP-Link) the TP-Link Group is not responsible
for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, decency, or any other
aspect of the content of such sites.
The inclusion of such a link does
not imply endorsement of any site by TP-Link Group or any association
with its operators.</p>
<p>TP-Link cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or
services that you purchase from any third-party site that links to or
from TP-Link since the third-party sites are owned and operated by
independent retailers.
TP-Link does not endorse any of the merchandise
purchased from any third-party site, nor has TP-Link taken any steps to
confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the information contained
on such third-party sites.
TP-Link does not make any representations or
warranties as to the security of any information (including, without
limitation, credit card and other personal information) you might be
requested to give any third-party, and you irrevocably waive any claim
against us with respect to such sites.
We strongly encourage you to make
whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before
proceeding with any online transaction with any of these third-parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>Termination</strong>
</p>
<p>You are free to stop using the Services at any time.
You understand and
agree that we may or may not delete your User Content in the event that
you stop using the Services.
At any time, TP-Link may (a) suspend or
terminate your rights to access or use the Services if TP-Link in good
faith believes that you have used the Services in violation of these
Terms, including any incorporated guidelines, terms, or rules.
If you
transfer a Product to a new owner, your right to use the Services with
respect to that Product automatically terminates.
The new owner will
have no right to use the Product or Services under your account and will
need to register for a separate account with TP-Link unless the new
owner already has an account with TP-Link that can be connected to that
Product or Service.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that we may retain copies of such User Content
indefinitely.
In the event that we elect to terminate your account, we
will try to provide advance notice to you prior to termination so that
you are able to retrieve any important User Content stored in your
account.
You understand and agree that we may provide no advanced notice
for any reason, but usually because it would be impractical, illegal,
not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise
harmful to the rights or property of TP-Link.</p>
<p>
<strong>Product Specifications, Pricing, Typographical Errors</strong>
</p>
<p>We do our best to describe every product or service offered on the
Services as accurately as possible.
However, we are human, and therefore
we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content
on the Services is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free.
In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications,
TP-Link shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole
discretion.
If we charged your credit card or other account prior to
cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of
the charge.
Additional Terms may apply.
If a product you purchased from
TP-Link is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused
condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging.</p>
<p>
<strong>Security</strong>
</p>
<p>Any usernames and passwords used for the Services are for individual use
only.
You shall be responsible for the security of your username and
password (if any).
TP-Link shall be entitled to monitor your username
and password and, at its discretion, require you to change it.
If you
use a username and password that TP-Link considers insecure, TP-Link
will be entitled to require your username or password to be changed
and/or terminate your account.
However, TP-Link cannot guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security
measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
You
acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.
You agree to immediately notify TP-Link of any unauthorized use, or
suspected unauthorized use, of your account or any other breach of
security of which you become aware.
TP-Link is not liable to you for any
loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above
requirements.</p>
