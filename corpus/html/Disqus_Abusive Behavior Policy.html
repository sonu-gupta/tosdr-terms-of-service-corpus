         Abusive Behavior Policy Written by Disqus <br> Updated over a week ago <p>Engaging in targeted abuse or harassment on Disqus is a violation of the Basic Rules and Terms of Service.
We want to foster a positive and diverse community for rich discussions.
It’s our responsibility to cultivate an environment for communities and discussions to thrive and for users to feel safe when participating.
To that end, we’ve established this policy to help us evaluate abusive behavior in its various forms.<br>&nbsp;<br>We do not condone and can take action on the following types of abusive behavior including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>targeted harassment or encouraging others to do so</li>
<li>threat of violence or inciting it</li>
<li>self-harm or suicide</li>
<li>impersonating someone in a misleading or deceptive manner</li>
<li>posting personally identifiable information</li>
<li>improper use or breaking Disqus in such a way that it negatively hurts the experience for others</li>
<li>posting illegal content such as copyrighted material or child pornography</li>
</ul>
<p>All types of content is tolerated as long as it does not violate the Disqus Basic Rules and Terms of Service.
Additionally, we do not mediate content or intervene in disputes between users.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Disqus doesn't provide moderation, nor do we know the ins and outs of each community, the site moderators are the people you should contact to report abusive behavior that isn’t covered by the Basic Rules.
Learn more about how moderation works on Disqus.</p>How we enforce against abusive accounts<p>We review flagged user reports and will act to enforce the Basic Rules and Terms of Service when we find they have been broken.
Actions vary depending on the severity of the violation(s) and may include but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>removal of content (e.g.
comments, discussions)</li>
<li>warning the user of the violation</li>
<li>resetting the user's profile to default</li>
<li>global banning accounts or communities</li>
</ul>Reporting abusive behavior to Disqus<p>If you've become the target of abusive activity or are seeing it take place in a discussion or profile powered by Disqus, there are a few things you can do to raise awareness of the issue to the right people, and hopefully, find a resolution.
