There are two ways of doing this:</p>
<p>You can post your resume in our database as either a public or private resume.
Public resumes can be searched by parties with access to our searchable resume database.</p>

We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database.
You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.
However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.
We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.</p>
<p>Please note: It is not our practice to restrict access to our resume database to any particular customer(s).
Please be advised that your current employer or an entity affiliated with your current employer might be a customer of the ScienceCareers.org sites.
We are not responsible for any actions or results that may occur as a result of any customer’s access to and/or use of your resume.</p>
