</p>
<p>At Interfolio, we believe in being transparent about how we collect and use data.
This policy provides information about how and when we use cookies for these purposes.
&nbsp;We encourage you to also review our Privacy Policy which also includes additional details about the collection and use of information at Interfolio.</p>
What is a cookie?
<p>Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer or mobile device, which enables Interfolio features and functionality.
They are unique to your account or your browser.
Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser.
Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.</p>
<p>To find out more about cookies, visit&nbsp;this site.</p>
Does Interfolio use cookies?
<p>Yes.
Interfolio uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons.
We use both session-based and persistent cookies.
Interfolio sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by Interfolio and its corporate affiliates (collectively, the “<strong>Sites</strong>”).
In addition, we use third party cookies, like Google Analytics and Hotjar.</p>
How is Interfolio using cookies?
<p>Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which workspaces you are logged into.
Other cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and allow us to carry out analytics and customization, among other similar things.</p>
<p>Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit a Site or use our Services, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that’s consistent with your settings.
Cookies also make your interactions faster and more secure.</p>
<strong>Categories of Use</strong>
<strong>Description</strong>
<strong>Authentication</strong>
If you’re signed in to our Services, cookies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience.
<strong>Security</strong>
We use cookies to enable and support our security features, and to help us detect malicious activity.
<strong>Preferences, features and services</strong>
In all our products, including Dossier, Faculty Search, Review Promotion &amp.
Tenure, and Faculty180, we use cookies to remember user settings, such as the current user’s name and the tools to which they have access.
When applying to a position through Dossier or viewing applications in Interfolio, we use cookies to make sure we’re taking you to the right content.
By creating or signing in to an Interfolio account, we’ll assume you’re ok with us using cookies in this way.
Cookies can tell us what your communications preferences are.
They can help you fill out forms on our Sites more easily.
<strong>Performance, Analytics and Research</strong>
Throughout Interfolio’s site, we use&nbsp;web analytics software, specifically&nbsp;Google Analytics, to help us better understand how our users navigate and use our products.
Analytics help us uncover bugs, improve user pathways, and build better services.
Google offers a&nbsp;browser add-on&nbsp;for users who wish to prevent Google Analytics from collecting data.
What can you do if you don’t want cookies to be set or want them to be removed, or if you want to opt out of interest-based targeting?
<p>Some people prefer not to allow cookies, which is why most browsers give you the ability to manage cookies to suit you.
In some browsers you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more fine-grained control over your privacy.
What this means is that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust.</p>
<p>If you limit the ability of websites and applications to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience and/or lose the ability to access the services, since it will no longer be personalized to you.
It may also stop you from saving customized settings, like login information.</p>
Does Interfolio respond to Do Not Track Signals?
<p>Our Sites and Services do not collect personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.
Therefore, “do not track” signals transmitted from web browsers do not apply to our Sites or Services, and we do not alter any of our data collection and use practices upon receipt of such a signal.</p>
