</ul>Terms and Conditions of Use<p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the https://short.io website (the "Service") operated by Short.io (formerly short.cm) ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>Subscriptions<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)").
You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle").
Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Short.io (formerly short.cm) cancels it.
You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Short.io (formerly short.cm) customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
You shall provide Short.io (formerly short.cm) with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.
By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Short.io (formerly short.cm) to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Short.io (formerly short.cm) will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>Fee Changes<p>Short.io (formerly short.cm), in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.
Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Short.io (formerly short.cm) will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>Refunds<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Short.io (formerly short.cm) on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Short.io (formerly short.cm).</p>Accounts<p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times.
Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.</p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account.
You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.
You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>Links To Other Web Sites<p>Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Short.io (formerly short.cm).</p>

<p>Except for liability that cannot be limited by law, each Partys total aggregate liability, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be limited to an amount equal to the Subscription fees paid by you to Short.io during the preceding 12 month period from the date of the claim of liability.</p>Intellectual Property Indemnification<p>Short.io will defend, at its own expense, any third-party claim, suit or proceeding brought against you to the extent it is based upon a claim that the Service to which you have access under this Agreement, when used in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, infringe any United States patent, copyright or trade secret of any third party.</p>Disclaimer<p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk.
