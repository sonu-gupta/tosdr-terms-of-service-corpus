<p>Some of the Products provided on Yuka, as part of the Service, are provided on the basis of payment.</p>
<p>The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of Yuka.</p>
Product description
<p>Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of Yuka and are subject to change without notice.</p>
<p>While Products on Yuka are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on Yuka through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>
Purchasing process
<p>Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.</p>
<p>The purchasing process includes these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.</li>
<li>After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.</li>
</ul> Order submission
<p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
<li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
<li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.</li>
</ul>
<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>
Prices
<p>Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.</p>
<p>Prices on Yuka are displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.</li>
</ul> Methods of payment
<p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
<p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees.
In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of Yuka.</p>
<p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services.
Therefore, Yuka does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>
<p>If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order.
Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.</p>
Purchase via app store
<p>Yuka or specific Products available for sale on Yuka must be purchased via a third-party app store.
To access such purchases, Users must follow the instructions provided on the relevant online store (such as "Apple App Store" or "Google Play"), which may vary depending on the particular device in use.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties’ terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.</p>
<p>Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.</p>
Retention of Product ownership
<p>Until payment of the total purchase price is received by the Owner, any Products ordered shall not become the User’s property.</p>
Retention of usage rights
<p>Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.</p>
DeliveryDelivery of digital content
<p>Unless otherwise stated, digital content purchased on Yuka is delivered via download on the device(s) chosen by Users.</p>
<p>Users acknowledge and accept that in order to download and/or use the Product, the intended device(s) and its respective software (including operating systems) must be legal, commonly used, up-to-date, and consistent with current market-standards.</p>
<p>Users acknowledge and accept that the ability to download the purchased Product may be limited in time and space.</p>
Contract durationSubscriptions
<p>Subscriptions allow Users to receive a Product continuously or regularly over a determined period of time.</p>
<p>Paid subscriptions begin on the day the payment is received by the Owner.</p>
<p>In order to maintain subscriptions, Users must pay the required recurring fee in a timely manner.
Failure to do so may cause service interruptions.</p>
Fixed-term subscriptions
<p>Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the purchasing process.</p>
<p>Once the subscription period expires, the Product shall no longer be accessible, unless the User renews the subscription by paying the relevant fee.</p>
<p>Fixed-term subscriptions may not be terminated prematurely and shall run out upon expiration of the subscription term.</p>
Subscriptions handled via Apple ID
<p>Users may subscribe to a Product using the Apple ID associated with their Apple App Store account by using the relevant process on Yuka.
When doing so, Users acknowledge and accept that</p>
<ul>
<li>any payment due shall be charged to their Apple ID account;</li>
<li>subscriptions are automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires;</li>
<li>any and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within 24-hours before the end of the current period;</li>
<li>subscriptions can be managed or cancelled in the Users’ Apple App Store account settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or diverging provision of these Terms.</p>
Automatic renewal
<p>
<strong>Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase, unless the User cancels the subscription within the deadlines for termination specified in the relevant section of these Terms and/or Yuka.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.</strong>
</p>
Termination
<p>
<strong>Recurring subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside Yuka.</strong>
</p>
Termination notice
<p>
<strong>If the notice of termination is received by the Owner before the subscription renews, the termination shall take effect as soon as the current period is completed.</strong>
</p> User rightsRight of withdrawal
<p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.
Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>
Who the right of withdrawal applies to
<p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>
<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>
Exercising the right of withdrawal
<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document.
Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.
In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>
<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>In case of purchase of a digital content not supplied in a tangible medium</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>
</ul> Effects of withdrawal
<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract.
Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.
In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p> Liability and indemnificationEU UsersIndemnification
<p>The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees harmless from and against any claim or demand ⁠— including but not limited to lawyer's fees and costs ⁠— made by any third party due to or in relation with any culpable use of or connection to the Service, violation of these Terms, infringement of any third-party rights or statutory provision by the User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>
Limitation of liability
<p>Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable statutory product liability provisions, Users shall have no right to claim damages against the Owner (or any natural or legal person acting on its behalf).</p>
<p>This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as Yuka has been appropriately and correctly used by the User.</p>
<p>Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment the contract was entered into.</p>
<p>In particular, within the limits stated above, the Owner shall not be liable for:</p>
<ul>
<li>any loss of business opportunities and any other loss, even indirect, that may be incurred by the User (such as, but not limited to, trading losses, loss of revenue, income, profits or anticipated savings, loss of contracts or business relationships, loss of reputation or goodwill, etc.);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>damages or losses resulting from interruptions or malfunctions of Yuka due to acts of force majeure, or unforeseen and unforeseeable events and, in any case, independent of the will and beyond the control of the Owner, such as, but not limited to, failures or disruptions of telephone or electrical lines, the Internet and / or other means of transmission, unavailability of websites, strikes, natural disasters, viruses and cyber attacks, interruptions in the delivery of products, third-party services or applications;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>any losses that are not the direct consequence of a breach of the Terms by the Owner;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>any damage, prejudice or loss occurring due to viruses or other malware contained in or connected to files available for download from the internet or via Yuka.
Users are responsible for implementing sufficient security measures – such as anti-viruses and firewalls to prevent any such infection or attack and for securing backup copies of all data or information exchanged via or uploaded to Yuka.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to all Users not qualifying as Consumers:</p>
<p>In any event of liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments that have been, will be or would be received by the Owner from the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or the period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.</p>
Australian UsersLimitation of liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner’s sole discretion, to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</p>
