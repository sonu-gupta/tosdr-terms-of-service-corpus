Terminology used
<p>UNICOM’s data protection and privacy measures are governed by the (i) the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (<strong>“GDPR”</strong>) and any national implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation, as amended or updated from time to time, in the UK and then (ii) any successor legislation to the GDPR or the Data Protection Act 1998 (<strong>“Data Protection Legislation"</strong>).</p>
<p>For the purpose of Data Protection Legislation:</p>
<ol>
<li>where personal data is provided directly to UNICOM through use of its Websites, email, or other means where UNICOM is determining the way in which that personal data is processed, then UNICOM will be a data controller of such information.
and</li>
<li>where UNICOM is provided personal data in its capacity of providing Services to its customers, then UNICOM will only process that personal data in accordance with the instructions of its customers and UNICOM will therefore act as a data processor in respect of such personal data.
UNICOM’s customer will be the data controller of that personal data for that purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where UNICOM acts as a data processor on behalf of its customers, UNICOM will process that personal data on the instructions of the customer, who would have collected that personal data in accordance with that customer’s own privacy policy.
The data subject should therefore check the customer’s own privacy policy, to ensure they understand how their personal data may be processed.</p>
