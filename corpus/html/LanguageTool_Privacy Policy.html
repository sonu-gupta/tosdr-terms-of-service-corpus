<li> Legal bases of the processing <p>The processing of personal data requires a legal basis, which we would like to present to you below.</p>
<p>For processing of personal data for which we obtain the consent of the data subject, Article 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.</p>
<p>When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
This also includes processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.</p>
<p>Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Article 6 (1) lit.
c GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>
<p>If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Article 6 (1) lit.
f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.
The legitimate interest of our company lies in the performance of our business activities as well as in the analysis, optimization and maintenance of the security of our online offer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Log files, hosting <p>In the server statistics, data is automatically stored that the browser transmits to us as part of our legitimate interest in analysis and for security reasons (so-called "log files").</p>

This allows us to detect false alarms from our system and avoid them in the future.</li>
<li>If you accept correction suggestions, we anonymously store the internal ID of this error rule (e.g.
EN_A_VS_AN for the rule that finds a/an confusions).</li>
<li>In the very rare case of an internal software error (so-called "exception"), we anonymously store the record that triggered the error so that we can find the cause and correct the error.
These records are stored anonymously for up to 14 days.</li>
<li>To improve the speed of our software, we store checked records and the errors found in them for up to 15 minutes on our servers in the main memory (not on a permanent storage medium).
The storage is done without IP address or other information that would allow the records to be assigned to a person.</li>

This allows us to determine which pages do not work correctly with our add-on.</li>
<li>Only if you have an account on languagetool.org and if you are logged into the add-on with that account: The add-on contacts our servers periodically (about once a day) to let us know that you are an active user.

<li> Facebook <p>Within the scope of your consent, we use services of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"), for the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer.</p>
<p>EU standard contractual clauses have been agreed with Facebook, so that possible measures have been taken to ensure compliance with European data protection law.</p>
<ol>
<li> Facebook Social Plugins <p>Our website uses social plug-ins ("plug-ins") from Facebook.
The plug-ins are marked with a Facebook logo (white "f" on a blue tile, the terms "Like", "Like" or a "thumbs up" sign) or the addition "Facebook Social Plug- In".</p>
<p>When you call up a web page of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers.</p>
<br>
<p>The content of the plug-in is transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser, which then integrates it into the website.
This transmits personal information, such as your IP address, URL, date and time, as well as other browser-related information to Facebook and stores it in the U.S., whereby according to Facebook in Germany only an anonymized IP is collected.</p>
<p>If you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to your Facebook account.
If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the "Like" button or posting a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted directly from your browser to Facebook, stored there and, depending on your Facebook settings, shared with your Facebook contacts.
If you do not wish this to happen, please log out of your Facebook account (before pressing the opt-in button).</p>
<p>Facebook stores your data as usage profiles and uses them for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or needs-based design of its website and other websites.
In doing so, Facebook uses cookies and similar technologies to display advertisements to you on Facebook services as well as outside of them, regardless of whether you have an account with Facebook and are logged in.
Facebook already sets cookies for this purpose when you have visited the page www.facebook.com and forwards your data to third parties.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the pages, have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by Facebook.
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, which will refuse all cookies from third parties.

<li> Instagram <p>Our website uses the social plug-in for the social network Instagram, which is operated by Facebook (hereinafter "Instagram").
You can recognize the link by the "Instagram icon" on our website.
When you call up a web page of our website that contains such a button, your browser establishes a direct connection with the servers of Instagram.</p>
<p>The content of the button is transmitted directly to your browser by Instagram and integrated into the website by it.
We therefore have no influence on the scope of the data that Instagram collects with the button.</p>
<p>By embedding the "Instagram" button, Instagram receives, among other things, the information that you have called up the corresponding page of our website under your IP address.
This information is stored and used in the USA and also passed on to third parties.</p>
<p>In doing so, Instagram uses cookies and similar technologies, including to serve ads.
Instagram may combine this information with information from other subsidiaries and thus create user profiles under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>If you click on the "Instagram icon" while you are logged into your Instagram account, you can link the content of our pages on your Instagram profile.
This allows Instagram to associate the visit to our pages with your user account and save it.
If you want to prevent this, you must log out of your Instagram account before clicking on the button.
We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the pages, have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by Instagram.

a small file, on your device.

If we should transmit data to Facebook for matching purposes, this data is encrypted locally in on the browser and only then sent to Facebook via a secure https connection.
This is done solely for the purpose of creating a comparison with the data encrypted in the same way by Facebook.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when using the Facebook Pixel, we use the additional function "extended matching" (in this case, data such as telephone numbers, email addresses or Facebook IDs of the users) to create target groups ("Custom Audiences" or "Look Alike Audiences") are transmitted to Facebook (encrypted).
Further information on "advanced matching": https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668.</p>

</li>
<li> Data storage outside the EU/EEA <p>As can be seen from the individual tool descriptions above, we use tools from US third-party providers.
Insofar as this is necessary for the notified purposes, it may happen that your IP address is processed in this course outside the European Economic Area, where a level of data protection corresponding to the European standard is not consistently ensured and confirmed (for example, by appropriate guarantee within the meaning of Art.
46 DS-GVO or an adequacy decision of the European Commission).
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out in particular that security authorities in a third country may gain access to your IP address without you being able to take legally effective action against them.</p>
<p>The transfer of the IP address to these third-party providers takes place in accordance with Art.
49 (1) lit.
a GDPR on the basis of your consent expressly given for this purpose in the consent banner.
This consent is voluntary.
You can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.
You will not suffer any disadvantages as a result.</p>
<p>In the opinion of some US third-party providers, a level of protection corresponding to the European standard is already guaranteed due to the conclusion of so-called standard contractual clauses as well as additional measures taken in the sense of the Schrems II case law.
However, since the suitability of such measures to ensure a sufficient level of data protection is disputed, we have decided to transfer your IP address only with your consent.</p>
</li>
<li> Rights of the data subject <p>You have a right to information about the personal data stored by us about you.
According to the legal provisions, you also have the right to correct incorrect data, blocking, data portability and deletion of your personal data.
To do this, send us an e-mail with the subject "Data protection".</p>
<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that processing of personal data relating to you is in breach of the law.</p>
<p>If you have given your consent, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time.
This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.</p>
<p>You may object to the future processing of your personal data in accordance with the legal requirements at any time.
The objection can be made in particular against the processing for purposes of direct advertising.</p>
</li>
<li> Storage period of the personal data <p>If we have not provided storage information on the specific points, the following applies: We store personal data for the duration of the respective statutory retention period or as long as the purpose of the collection exists.
After expiry of the retention period, the data is routinely deleted, unless it is necessary for the initiation or performance of a contract.
If user data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted as far as possible.
Accordingly, the data will be blocked if possible and not processed for other purposes.
This applies, for example, to user data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law.</p>
</li>
<li> Safety information <p>We make every effort to process your personal data by taking all technical and organizational possibilities to comply with the provisions of data protection laws and thus to protect this data.
Our website or the communication via our website with us is encrypted via HTTPS.</p>
