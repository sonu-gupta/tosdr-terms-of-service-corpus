         MyDramaList Privacy Policy <p>Your privacy is critically important to us.
At MyDramaList, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on MyDramaList is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>Who We Are and What This Policy Covers<p>Anyoung haseyo.

Sawasdee! We are the folks behind MyDramaList.com, the platform that gives fans of asian films and TV shows a voice to rate &amp.
review titles, create a watchlist, socialize with other fans and so much more.
This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use MyDramaList.com</p>
<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website and other services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>Information We Collect<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.
Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>Information You Provide to Us<p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.
The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.
Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.
For example, we require individuals who sign up for a MyDramaList.com account to provide a username and email address–and that’s it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.
For example, if you have a MyDramaList account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an “About Me” description.
Your public profile information is just that–public–so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Transaction and Billing Information:</strong> If you purchase a VIP subscription or any merchandise we may sell from us, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Communications With Us (Hi There!):</strong> You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our support staff via email or private message about a support question, or post in our public forums.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<em>Information We Collect Automatically</em>
<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.
We collect log information when you use our Services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services.
For example, we collect information about the actions that users perform on the site –in other words, who did what, when and to what thing (e.g., user posted a comment on ‘x’ page at so and so time).
We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>
<li>
<strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.
We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Information from Cookies &amp.
Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on emails.
MyDramaList uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.</li>
</ul>
<em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em>
<p>We may also get information about you from other sources.
For example, if you create or log into your MyDramaList.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Connected feature, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service.
The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>

</ul>
<em>Information Shared Publicly</em>
<p>Information that you choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly.
That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on MyDramaList are all available to others! Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>How Long We Keep Information<p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it–which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information–and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>Security<p>We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.
In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure.
Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.
Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information via the Internet.</p>Choices<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>

However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using the MyDramaList website, with the drawback that certain features of the site may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>

These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device.
This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests.
Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by MyDramaList and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.</p>Privacy Policy Changes<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, MyDramaList may change its Privacy Policy from time to time.
