In the event that issues arise over the use of particular usernames, for example where another person claims that your username appropriates their name, we will consider the circumstances reasonably and may require you to change your username (and we may then reassign your username).
If we have asked you to do this and you refuse, we may suspend or cancel your user account.
Importantly, and without impacting the above, we do not permit ‘domain squatting’ or ‘domain parking’ or similar, and we may reclaim and reallocate usernames that we reasonably believe have been created for these purposes.
