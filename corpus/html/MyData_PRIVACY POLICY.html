We have processes in place to make sure that only those people related to the organisation (staff, board, steering group), who need to access your data can do so.
By default, only the organisations’ staff have access to all collected personal data and others, such as board and steering group members, as well as our volunteers, are granted access on an as-needed basis.<br>
Some data may be shared with third parties and, where this happens, this is always indicated in the relevant registry description.</p>
<p>Before we ask for your data, we always apply the following tests to determine whether it is appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose test – why are we collecting this data?</li>
<li>Necessity test – is it essential that we collect this data?</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect the following types of personal information on the legal grounds of legitimate interests, contractual performance, and/or consent where applicable:</p>
