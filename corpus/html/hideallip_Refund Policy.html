</ul> Why we have a Refund Policy:<p>
</p> We believe in happy customers.
We believe all our products do their job, and do it well.<p>
</p> But we're realistic enough to know that our software isn't going to fit every situation.
That's why we have a strong refund policy.
If you aren't satisfied with our products, we would like them back - and we will refund you the money.<p>
</p> This allows you to purchase our products with confidence.
