The Square Party will pay all the arbitration fees due to LCIA for any Dispute.

For any claim where you are seeking relief, the Square Party will not seek to have you pay its attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and any Square Party also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorised users or beneficiaries of the Services.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these General Terms, Policies, Additional Terms or related documents will prevent any party from commencing proceedings and pursuing claims before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 19 in cases in which interim, injunctive or declaratory relief is required or where the right to issue proceedings would be prejudiced by the impending expiration of any applicable limitation period.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 18, any Dispute, to the extent arising out or of connection with the Payment Services, may only be resolved in accordance with Section 38 of the Payment Terms.</p>
<strong>19.

<p>Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions in Section 18, you irrevocably agree that the English courts in London, England will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any Dispute, but Square International and Square Europe are each entitled to apply to any court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect or enforce their respective Intellectual Property Rights and/or Confidential Information.</p>
<strong>20.
Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute</strong>
<p>Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.</p>

Neither Square International nor Square Europe is responsible for the performance of any Third Party Services.
The Services may contain links to third party websites.
The inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement or recommendation by any Square Company.

You and each Square Company agree that it shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in these General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms and Policies.

These General Terms do not limit any rights that Square International or Square Europe may have under trade secret, copyright, patent or other laws.
No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>
<p>Except as provided by this Section 23, no express term of these General Terms or any term implied hereunder is enforceable pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (the ‘Act’) by any person who is not a party hereto, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is available, apart from pursuant to that Act.
Any Square Entity may enforce any provision of these General Terms subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>
<p>Nothing in these General Terms or in any document referred to herein or in any arrangement contemplated herein creates a partnership or joint venture.</p>
<p>It is a condition of these General Terms that, in pre-contract negotiations and in the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations under these General Terms, each party hereto will at all times ensure its compliance with all Applicable Law relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including the Bribery Act 2010 (‘Anti-bribery Laws’) and that no party hereto will commit (or procure the commission of) any breach of any Anti-bribery Laws or do anything that would cause any other party to commit an offence under any Anti-bribery Laws.</p> GeneralPrivacy NoticeTerms of ServiceGovernmentAdditional Point of Sale TermsCommercial Entity AgreementDeclaration of ConformityDeveloper Terms of ServiceEU Applicant Privacy NoticeFee ScheduleHardware Policies and Limited WarrantyInstant Transfer TermsPayment TermsPoint-of-Sale, SaaS and Services TermsPayments<ul>
