<u>USERS OF SITES IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA</u>
</b>
</p>
<p>This section of this Privacy Policy applies only

Area and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>Legal Basis for Data Processing</b>: We process personal data for the purposes set out in this Privacy
Policy, as described above.
Our legal basis to process personal data includes
processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you
and us (for example, to provide you with the services you request and to
identify and authenticate you so you may use the Site).
necessary to comply
with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting
rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement).
necessary for our
legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to
improve the Site).
and based on consent by our customers (for example, to
communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with
marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by using
preference settings in emails or on our Sites, contacting the UMG Privacy Office, or emailing
us as set out in the Contact section) without affecting the lawfulness of
processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
<p>We may use automated decision-making
technologies, including profiling, to support our data processing activities.
Our automated decision-making capabilities include logic that attempts to
identify artists, music, communications, products, or offers that we believe
may interest you.
By using this logic, it helps us personalize your
interactions with UMG and UMG artists.
For you, this means that you may see
online advertisements, direct marketing communications (if you have subscribed),
or other advertising or marketing messages or special offers based on your
activity on our Sites or interactions with UMG Companies or our third party
partners.

transferring personal data to countries that
have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data
by the European Commission.

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
using specific contracts approved by the
European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in
Europe.</p>

<u>Web
Beacons</u>
</b>
</p>
<p>We, or our third
party partners, may employ a software technology called web beacons (also known
as web bugs, clear gifs or pixels) which helps us understand what content is
effective, for example by counting the number of users who have visited these
pages, and to understand usage patterns.
Web beacons are tiny graphics with a
unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let us know
when content is viewed.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s
computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and e-mail.
We, or our third-party partners, may tie the information gathered by web
beacons to the other information we collect about you.

<p>In addition to
disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may
opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks,
audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by
visiting websites operated by the Network
Advertising Initiative, Digital Advertising Alliance, or European
Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
