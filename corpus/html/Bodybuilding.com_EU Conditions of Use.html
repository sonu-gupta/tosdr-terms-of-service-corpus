<p>Cookies and Browser Settings</p>
<p>The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.
Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.</p>
<p>Internet Advertising</p>
<p>On BBcom UK-owned and operated sites and unaffiliated sites, BBcom UK displays interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our sites, content, or services.
Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalised or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as purchasing on our sites, use of devices, apps or software, visiting sites that contain BBcom UK content or ads, interacting with BBcom UK tools or using our payment services.</p>
<p>Like other online ad networks, we use cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies (collectively, 'cookies').
Cookies enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our sites and other sites.
This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads.
For example, if we know what ads you are shown we can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly.</p>
<p>We do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads.</p>
<p>We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads.
However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalised ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who bought or browsed for whey protein).
Also, some third-parties may provide us information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.</p>
<p>Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the advertisements that appear on our sites directly to your browser.
They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise advertising content.
We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice or this Cookies And Internet Advertising page.
Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.</p>
