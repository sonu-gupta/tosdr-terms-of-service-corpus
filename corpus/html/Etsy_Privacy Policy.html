Etsy uses the personal information it receives and collects in accordance with the purposes described in this policy.</p>
<p>You can also choose to provide information to a third party via Etsy’s API.
While users of Etsy’s API are required to follow Etsy’s API Terms of Use, including having appropriate privacy and security controls, Etsy does not have a direct partner relationship with these third parties and their processing of information is subject to their own privacy policies.

Community
<p>Etsy is a marketplace and a community.
We offer several features that allow members to connect and communicate in public or semi-public spaces, such as Forums and Teams, which are a part of the Etsy Community space.
You don't have to use these features, but if you do, please use common sense and good judgment when posting in these community spaces or sharing your personal information with others through the Services.
Be aware that any personal information that you choose to submit there can be read, collected, or used by others, or could be used to send unsolicited messages to you.
We engage certain third parties to assist in providing community services to you and, in the context of that relationship, we need to share some of your information with such third parties in order to provide that service.
This may include, for example, information from your Etsy account that is publicly available, your account’s status, your forum posts and Team memberships, your Etsy username and/or shop name, the display name you’ve optionally chosen to share publicly in your Etsy account, avatar image, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site.

You are responsible for the personal information that you choose to post in community spaces through the Services.
You can set your privacy preferences and download your data in your Community Settings, and close or delete your Community account by submitting a request to Etsy.</p>

<p>When you access or use the Services, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy.
We rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways.

and</li>
<li>Occasionally necessary to protect your vital interests or those of others (in rare cases where we may need to share information to prevent loss of life or personal injury).</li>
</ul>
<p>We principally rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at anytime) (i) to send marketing messages, (ii) for third-party data sharing related to advertising, and, to the extent applicable, (iii) for the use of location data for advertising purposes.
</p>
<p>We rely on consent for targeted online and offline marketing including through tools like Facebook Custom Audience and Google Customer Match.
We or our sellers may advertise our Services or our sellers’ products through a variety of different mediums and rely on your consent to do so off-site.
As part of this, we may work with advertising partners such as Facebook, Google, and other partners disclosed in our Cookies and Similar Technology Policy.
These partners have their own privacy policies and consent mechanisms for their customers, in addition to Etsy’s controls.
You may see the privacy policies and privacy choices for these partners, and the information you share with them, in our Cookies and Similar Technology Disclosures.
</p>
<p>Etsy may also use first party data (e.g.
your prior shopping and browsing patterns on our Site), and may combine it with other data collected from you, such as your location, or publicly available information, to permit us to create targeted audiences based on your known or inferred demographic and/or interests to provide you with more relevant and useful advertising on our site, in our direct marketing channels (like email), or with our off site marketing partners, like Google and Facebook, subject to their terms and privacy notice you agreed to with such partners .</p>
<p>
<strong>Our Legitimate Interests</strong>
</p>
<p>Where we process your information on the basis of legitimate interests, we do so as follows:</p>
<p>
<em>Providing and Improving our Services:</em> We use your information to improve and customize our Services, including sharing your information for such purposes, and we do so as it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests of improving our Services for our users.
This is also necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate interests in understanding how our Services are being used, and to explore and unlock ways to develop and grow our business.
It is also necessary to allow us to pursue our legitimate interests in improving our Services, efficiency, interest in Services for users, and obtaining insights into usage patterns of our Services.
As a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in customizing your on-site experience to help you search for and discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and sell their products on Etsy.</p>
<p>
<em>Providing Marketing Communications:</em> We rely on our legitimate interest to send you marketing messages (where permitted independent of consent) and for Etsy's advertising programs (including Etsy’s on-site advertising and marketing).</p>
<p>
<em>Keeping our Services Safe and Secure:</em> We use your information for safety and security purposes, which can include sharing your information for such purposes, and we do so because it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests or those of a third party in ensuring the security of our Services, preventing harm to individuals or property, or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage to Etsy’s systems, or those of our users or our partners.
This includes enhancing protection of our community against spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime, and security risks of all kinds.
We use your information to provide and improve the Services, for billing and payments, for identification and authentication, and for general research and aggregate reporting.
For example, in accordance with our existing case resolution process, we may use information you provide to resolve disputes with Etsy or other members.
</p>
<p>
<em>Buying and Selling: </em> As part of the buying and selling process, Etsy will facilitate the sharing of information between the two members involved in the transaction, such as the other Etsy member's shipping address and payment status.
This can also involve us sharing your information with some of our third party partners such as our shipping and payment partners to enable us to provide the Service to you.
Such partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
In some instances, while they are subject to Etsy’s privacy and security requirements for vendors, these partners, not Etsy, are responsible for the protection of personal information under their control.
By making a sale or a purchase on Etsy, you are directing us to share your information in this way.
Since this is an important part of the Services we provide, we need to do this in order to perform our obligations under our Terms of Use.
We expect you to respect the privacy of the member whose information you have received.
As described in Etsy's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use that information only for Etsy-related communications or for Etsy-facilitated transactions.
Etsy has not granted a license to you to use the information for unauthorized transactions or sending unsolicited commercial messages in violation of any applicable laws, including any consent requirements of the jurisdiction of the recipient.
You should only add a member to your email or physical mailing list or otherwise use or store a member’s personal information in accordance with applicable laws, including any consent requirements that apply in that member's jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
<em>Site Customization:</em> We may learn about the types of products that you’re interested in from your browsing and purchasing behavior on (and off) the Site or Apps and use such information to suggest potential purchases as a result.
As a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in customizing your on-site experience to help you search for and discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and sell their products on Etsy.
</p>
<p>
<em>Legal and Safety:</em> Etsy may also retain, preserve, or release your personal information to a third party in the following limited circumstances: in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet legitimate national security or law enforcement requirements.
to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or defend against impending or asserted legal claims, including to collect a debt, or a material violation of our policies (including our Intellectual Property Policy).
to comply with a subpoena, court order, legal process, regulation, or other legal requirement.
or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to our rights or property, or violations of Etsy's Terms of Use.
For example, if permitted due to the forgoing circumstances, your information may be shared with tax authorities or other governmental agencies.
In the cases set out above, our use of your information may be necessary for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interest in keeping our Services secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage.
Such use may also be necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend legal claims or to facilitate the collection of taxes and prevention of tax fraud.
It may also be necessary in the public interest (such as to prevent crime) or to protect vital interests (in rare cases where we may need to share information to prevent loss of life or personal injury).</p>
<p>If Etsy receives a lawful, verified request for a member’s records or information in one of the limited circumstances described in the previous paragraph, Etsy may disclose personal information, which may include, but may not be limited to, a member’s name, address, phone number, email address, company/trading name and, where appropriate, bank account and transaction details.
Find out more about how Etsy responds to requests for records or information about members of Etsy’s community in our Requests for Information Policy.</p>
<p>
<em>Affiliated Businesses:</em> Etsy is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them for a variety of purposes, including assisting us to perform and improve the Services.
These businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or, with your consent, offer promotions (including email promotions) to you.
Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, including providing you with the opportunity to sign up with such partners and allow them to more effectively market to you.
When an affiliated business assists in facilitating your transaction, we may need to share information related to the transaction with that affiliated business in order to facilitate your transaction, and this forms part of the Services we provide in accordance with our Terms of Use.
We rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at any time) to send marketing messages and for third-party sharing relating to advertising.
As part of this, we may work with advertising partners such as Facebook or Google, and we may use analytics aggregated from usage information including, for example, search keywords, favorites, browsing history, and purchase history.</p>
<p>
<em>Aggregated Information:</em> Etsy may share demographic information with business partners, but it will be aggregated and de-personalized so that personal information is not revealed.</p>
<p>
<em>Service Providers:</em> Etsy also needs to engage third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, and analytics and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and market the Services.
These third parties have only limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are obligated to Etsy not to disclose or use your information for other purposes.
Our engagement of service providers is often necessary for us to provide the Services to you, particularly where such companies play important roles like helping us keep our Service operating and secure.
In some other cases, these service providers aren’t strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our users.
In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our Services better.</p>
<p>
<em>Business Reorganization:</em> In some cases, Etsy may choose to buy or sell assets.
Such transactions may be necessary and in our legitimate interests, particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our business to develop over the long term.
In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.
If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site and the App, and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>
<em>Third Parties:</em> Third-party plug-ins also collect information about your use of the Site.
For example, when you load a page on Etsy that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a “Like” or “Send” button, you are also loading content from that third-party site.
That site may request cookies directly from your browser.
These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party site.
In addition, certain cookies and other similar technologies on the Site are used by third parties for targeted online marketing and other purposes.
These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you use the Services.
Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.
Etsy chooses and manages these third-party technologies placed on its Sites and Apps.
However, these are third-party technologies, and they are subject to that third party's privacy policy.
For more information, see our Cookies &amp.
Similar Technologies Policy.
We rely on your consent to drop and read these cookies when not technically necessary or when not required based on another purpose such as legitimate interest.
</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (such as other members who sell using the Services, certain third-party providers on whom we rely to provide certain services, or API users) that Etsy does not own or control or individuals that Etsy does not employ or manage, except as otherwise provided for in the Terms or as required by law.
If you provide your information to such third parties in connection with your use of the Services, different practices may apply to the use or disclosure of the information that you provide to them.
While Etsy requires these third parties to follow Etsy’s privacy and security requirements, Etsy does not control the privacy or security policies of such third parties.
To the full extent applicable in your jurisdiction, Etsy is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of these sellers, API users, or other websites on the internet, even those linked to or from the Services.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them.
For the purposes of European law, these sellers, third party providers, and API users are independent controllers of data, which means that they are responsible for providing and complying with their own policies relating to any personal information they obtain in connection with the Services.

Transfers
<p>Etsy operates a global service.
If you reside outside of North or South America, your personal information is controlled by Etsy Ireland UC.
By using our Services, you understand that Etsy Ireland UC may share some of the information it gathers with Etsy, Inc.
(its US parent company) or other Etsy affiliates for purposes described in this privacy policy, including for ID verification, transaction reviews, and payment processing.</p>
<p>The United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws.
When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live.
For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country.
In particular, if your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with US law.</p>
<p>To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information: </p>
Model Clauses
<p>The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of Europe.
We often use these Model Clauses when transferring personal information outside of Europe.
You can request a copy of our Model Clauses by emailing legal@etsy.com.</p>
Necessary for the Performance of the Contract between Etsy and its Members
<p>Etsy provides a voluntary service.
you can choose whether or not to use the Services.
As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the U.S.
to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our Terms of Use), we need to transfer your personal information to the U.S.
and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services.
Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information around the world.
&nbsp;</p>
8.
Security
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it is received, for example encryption is used for certain information (such as credit card numbers) using TLS (transport layer security).
Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<p>Your account information is protected by a password.
It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your account and information by choosing your password carefully and by keeping your password and computer secure, such as by signing out after using the Services.
Etsy offers advanced security features and settings for members, such as two-factor authentication for signing in, and sign in history and notifications.
you can view more information in your account settings.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at legal@etsy.com.
</p>
9.
Retention
<p>Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your account is active (i.e., for the lifetime of your Etsy member account), or as needed to provide the Services to you.
If you no longer want Etsy to use your information to provide the Services to you, you may close your account.
Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this policy.
In addition, Etsy sellers may also be required to retain and use your information in order to comply with their own legal obligations.
Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account.
We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes.
These log files are generally retained for a brief period of time, except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to improve site functionality, or we are legally obligated to retain them for longer time periods.</p>

Your Rights &amp.
Choices
<p>Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provide users with rights related to their personal information.
Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you.
You may change or correct your Etsy account information through your account settings.
You may also remove certain optional information that you no longer wish to be publicly visible through the Services, such as your name.
You can also request to permanently close your account and delete your personal information.
Depending on your location, you may also benefit from a number of rights with respect to your information.
While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply in limited cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Right to Access &amp.
Portability</strong>: You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings.
You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format and information explaining how that information is used.

<strong>Right to Correction</strong>: You have the right to request that we rectify inaccurate information about you.
By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to Restrict Processing</strong>: In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.</li>
<li>

See this Help Center article for more information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to Object</strong>: If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances.
In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons.
Where we use your personal data for direct marketing purposes, you can object using the unsubscribe link in such communications or changing your account email settings.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to Withdraw Consent</strong>: Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using specific features provided to enable you to withdraw consent, like an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences.
If you have consented to share your precise device location details but would no longer like to continue sharing that information with us, you can revoke your consent to the sharing of that information through the settings on your mobile device.
This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CCPA provides California residents with the following additional rights: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Right to Know</strong>: California residents may request disclosure of the specific pieces and/or categories of personal information that the business has collected about them, the categories of sources for that personal information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, the categories of personal information that we have disclosed, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to Opt-Out</strong>: To the extent that Etsy “sells” personal information(as that term is defined under the CCPA), California residents are entitled to opt-out of the “sale” of data at any time (see below for more information).
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings.
Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above by contacting us by submitting a message through our contact form available in our Help Center, chat support, or through any other channels available via our Help Center.
Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request.</p>
<p>Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information.
However, we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights, including otherwise denying you goods or services, providing you with a different level or quality of services, or charging you different prices or rates for services.
If you need further assistance, you can contact Etsy through one of the channels listed below under “Contact”.
We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>Please note that we may verify your identity before we are able to process any of the requests described in this Section, and in our discretion, deny your request if we are unable to verify your identity.
As a part of this process, government or other identification may be required.
You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification, and we may verify the authenticity of the request directly with you.</p>
<p>
<strong>Email &amp.
Messages</strong>
</p>
<p>You may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from Etsy in your account settings.
Etsy may send you messages about the Services or your activity.
Some of these messages are required, service-related messages for members (such as transactional messages or legal notices).
Other messages are not required, such as newsletters.
You can control which optional messages you choose to receive by changing your account settings, and you can learn more in the “Messages from Etsy” Section of this policy.
If you no longer wish to use the Services or receive service-related messages (except for legally required notices), then you may close your account.

<strong>Additional Disclosures for California Residents</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Notice of Collection</em>
</p>
<p>In addition to the Rights &amp.
Choices described above, the CCPA requires disclosure of the categories of personal information collected over the past 12 months.
While this information is provided in greater detail in the “Information Collected or Received Section above, the categories of personal information that we have collected – as described by the CCPA – are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers, including name, email address, shop name, IP address, and an ID or number assigned to your account.</li>
<li>Other individual records such as phone number, billing address, or credit or debit card information.
This category includes personal information protected under pre-existing California law (Cal.
Civ.
Code 1798.80(e)), and overlaps with other categories listed here.</li>
<li>Demographics, such as your age or gender, or, where you have provided such information to Etsy voluntarily, demographic information about your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity, provided in relation to specific marketing and advocacy projects and campaigns.This category includes data that may qualify as protected classifications under other California or federal laws.</li>
<li>Commercial information, including purchases and engagement with the Services.</li>
<li>Internet activity, including your interactions with our Services and what led you to our Services.</li>
<li>Sensory visual data, such as pictures posted on our Service.</li>
<li>Geolocation data provided through location enabled services such as WiFi and GPS.</li>
<li>Inferences, including information about your interests, preferences and favorites.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>The Purposes for Our Collection</em>
</p>
<p>We collect and use these categories of personal information for our business and commercial purposes described in the “Information Uses, Sharing and Disclosure” Section above, including providing and improving the Services, maintaining the safety and security of the Services, processing purchase and sale transactions, and for advertising and marketing services.</p>
<p>
<em>Third Party Marketing and Advertising and Your Rights (Opt-Out of “Sale”)</em>
</p>
<p>Etsy does not sell personal information to third parties for monetary value.
However, the term “sale” is defined broadly under the California Consumer Privacy Act.
To the extent that “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include interest based advertising or other data uses described in the “Information Uses, Sharing and Disclosure” Section above, we will comply with applicable law as to those activities.
You can read more in our Cookies &amp.
Similar Technologies Policy.
</p>
<p>To opt-out of receiving interest based advertising, you can exercise your choice by using your account privacy settings, or the general privacy settings link located at the footer of our homepage and most pages of the Site.
The right to opt-out of interest based advertising is available to all Etsy users.</p>
<p>
<em>Do Not Track Signals</em>
</p>
<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit.
Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals.
Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals.
For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>
<p>
<em>Shine the Light</em>
</p>
<p>California law entitles residents to ask for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
Other than to Sellers on Etsy (see “Buying and Selling” under the “Information Uses, Sharing and Disclosure” Section above), who must obtain your separate consent for their own marketing off of Etsy, or unless you request us to or consent to it, Etsy does not share any personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
If you have questions about these practices, you can contact us through one of the channels listed in the “Contact” Section below.
