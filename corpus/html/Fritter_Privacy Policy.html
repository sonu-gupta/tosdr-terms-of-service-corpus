         Fritter Privacy Policy TLDR.
<p>No data is collected by Fritter, unless you submit a crash dump, or manually send a "Hello" ping in the app.
Interaction with Twitter is minimised, but you still need to agree to their privacy policy.</p> Declaration <p>Fritter <i>does not</i>, and will never, collect user data unless voluntarily submitted by the user.</p>
<p>Fritter <i>does not</i>, and will never, share user data with any third-party, except data submitted by users in requests to Twitter (e.g.
searching for a hashtag), or unless that data has voluntarily been submitted (e.g.
uploading a crash dump).</p>
<p>Fritter <i>does not</i>, and will never, contain features that rely on monetisation.
Donations and sponsorship, however, are accepted, but will not provide app-changing perks to those donators/sponsors.</p> Third Party <p>Although non-anonymous interaction with Twitter is minimised:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fritter will request content that you explicitly want to be displayed.
For example, if you want to view a tweet, it is requested directly from Twitter</li>
<li>No personal details (such as phone details, call logs or contacts) are sent to Twitter</li>
<li>However, since we do send requests directly to Twitter, your usage of Fritter still relies upon your acceptance of Twitter's privacy policy</li>
