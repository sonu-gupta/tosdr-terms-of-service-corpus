</ul>Data Processing Addendum<p>This Data Processing Addendum (“<strong>DPA</strong>”) sets out the additional terms and conditions on which A Cloud Guru Ltd.
and Serverless Heroes, Inc.
or their affiliates (“<strong>ACG</strong>”), will process Personal Data when providing services to the party subscribing to ACG’s services (“<strong>Subscriber</strong>,” “<strong>you</strong>,” “<strong>your</strong>”), where those services are governed by GDPR or where the parties otherwise agree that this DPA applies.
This DPA supplements and is incorporated into the Agreement between ACG and Subscriber.</p>
<p>
<strong>BACKGROUND AND INTERPRETATION</strong>
</p>
<p>A.
Subscriber and ACG entered into an Agreement that may require ACG to process Personal Data on behalf of Subscriber.</p>
<p>B.
This DPA contains the mandatory clauses required by Article 28(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/67) (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”) for contracts between controllers and processors.</p>
<p>C.
This DPA consists of two parts: the main body of the DPA, and Annex A, B (including Appendices 1 and 2) and C.&nbsp.
This DPA, including the Standard Contractual Clauses in Annex B, form a part of the Agreement and are each deemed to be executed in connection with the execution of the Agreement by ACG and Subscriber and legally binding upon such parties.</p>
<p>D.
The Annexes hereto form part of this DPA, and any reference to this DPA includes the Annexes.&nbsp.
In the case of conflicting terms, the following terms will govern, in order of precedence: first, the Standard Contractual Clauses, then the body of this DPA, then the Annexes to this DPA, then the Agreement.</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>DATA PROCESSING</strong>.</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp.
With respect to Personal Data of Data Subjects: (a) ACG will act as “processor” of Personal Data and Subscriber will act either as “controller” or “processor,” as defined by GDPR.
and (b) ACG will acts as a “Service Provider” as defined by CCPA</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp.

<p>2.5.&nbsp.
ACG will process Personal Data only (a) for the Business Purpose, (b) as otherwise initiated or instructed by Subscriber or its Data Subjects (e.g., via email, support tickets or instructions for configuration of tools or features made available by ACG in connection with the Services) (“<strong>Instructions</strong>“), or (b) as required by Data Protection Laws.&nbsp.
The parties agree that the Agreement and DPA are deemed to be Instructions.&nbsp.
Any additional or alternate instructions must be agreed separately agreed upon by Subscriber and ACG.&nbsp.
ACG will promptly notify Subscriber if, in ACG’s opinion, Subscriber’s Instructions would not comply with Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL DATA.</strong>
</p>
<p>ACG will maintain the confidentiality of all Personal Data and will not disclose Personal Data to third parties except as authorized by Subscriber’s Agreement, as otherwise by Subscriber in writing, or as required by law.
If a law, court, regulator or supervisory authority requires ACG to process or disclose Personal Data, ACG will first inform Subscriber of the legal or regulatory requirement and give Subscriber an opportunity to object or challenge the requirement, unless ACG is legally prohibited from doing so.
If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, nothing in this Section 3 varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>
<strong> Obligations OF ACG PERSONNEL</strong>.</p>
<p>ACG restricts its personnel from processing Personal Data without authorization by ACG as described in the ACG Security Standards.
ACG imposes appropriate contractual obligations upon its personnel, including relevant obligations regarding confidentiality, data protection and data security.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>SECURITY</strong>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>5.1.
ACG will at all times implement appropriate technical and organizational measures as described in the AGG Security Standards.</p>
<p>5.2.&nbsp.
In particular, ACG has implemented and will maintain the following measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved, including as appropriate:</p>
<p>(a) the pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data when such data is being transferred;</p>
<p>(b) process to maintain the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;</p>
<p>(c) written plan to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
and</p>
<p>(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of security measures.</p>
<p>Such measures may be obtained by Subscriber from ACG or directly from a third-party supplier.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>SUB-PROCESSING</strong>.</p>
<p>6.1.&nbsp.
Subscriber agrees that ACG may use sub-processors to fulfill its contractual obligations under the Agreement or this DPA or to provide certain services on its behalf.&nbsp.
For the avoidance of doubt, the above authorization constitutes Subscriber’s written consent to the sub-processing by ACG for the purposes of Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp.
ACG’s Sub-processor List (available at&nbsp;https://acloudguru.com/policies/subprocessors) (“<strong>Sub-processor List</strong>“) contains an updated list of sub-processors that are currently engaged by ACG to carry out processing activities on Personal Data on behalf of Subscriber.</p>
<p>6.2.&nbsp.
ACG will provide notice of new subprocessors by publicly posting new sub-processors on ACG’s Sub-processor List, with a date-updated notice, prior to authorizing any to new sub-processor to process Personal Data.&nbsp.
Subscriber may also subscribe to receive updates as provided on the Subprocessor List page.&nbsp.
Subscriber may reasonably object to ACG’s use of a new sub-processor (if making the Personal Data available to sub-processor may violate applicable Data Protection Laws or weaken the protections of such Personal Data) by notifying ACG in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of ACG’s notice.&nbsp.
Such notice to ACG shall explain the reasonable grounds for the objection.&nbsp.
In the event Subscriber so objects to a new sub-processor, ACG will use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Subscriber a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Subscriber’s configuration or use of the Services to avoid the processing of Personal Data by the objectionable sub-processor without burdening Subscriber.&nbsp.
If ACG is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, either party may terminate without penalty the Agreement with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by ACG without the use of the objectionable new sub-processor by providing written notice to the other party.&nbsp.
Except as set forth in this Section, or as Subscriber may otherwise authorize, ACG will not permit any sub-processor to carry out processing activities on Personal Data on behalf of Subscriber.</p>
<p>6.3.&nbsp.
Where ACG authorizes any sub-processor as described above:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp.
ACG will restrict the sub-processor’s access to Personal Data only to what is necessary to maintain the Services or to provide the Services to Subscriber and any Users in accordance with the Agreement and ACG will prohibit the sub-processor from accessing Personal Data for any other purpose;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp.
ACG maintains control over all Personal Data it entrusts to the sub-processor;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp.
ACG will enter into a written agreement with the sub-processor and, to the extent that the sub-processor is performing the same data processing services that are being provided by ACG under this DPA, ACG will impose on the sub-processor the same contractual obligations that ACG has under this DPA.
and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp.
ACG will remain responsible for its compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of the sub-processors that cause ACG to breach any of ACG’s obligations under this DPA.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</strong>.</p>
<p>7.1.&nbsp.
ACG will, at no additional cost, take such technical and organizational measures as may be appropriate, and promptly provide such information to Subscriber as Subscriber may reasonably require, to enable Subscriber to comply with:</p>
<p>(a) the rights of Data Subjects under applicable Data Protection Laws, including subject access rights, the rights to rectify and erase personal data, object to the processing and automated processing of personal data, and restrict the processing of personal data.
and</p>
<p>(b) information or assessment notices served on Subscriber by any supervisory authority under the Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>7.2.&nbsp.
ACG will notify Subscriber immediately if it receives any complaint, notice or communication that relates directly or indirectly to the processing of the Personal Data or to either party’s compliance with the Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>7.3.&nbsp.
ACG will notify Subscriber within ten (10) business days if it receives a request from a Data Subject to exercise any of their related rights under the Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>7.4.&nbsp.
ACG will provide Subscriber with reasonable assistance in responding to any complaint, notice, communication or Data Subject request.</p>
<p>7.5.&nbsp.
ACG will not disclose the Personal Data to any Data Subject or to a third party other than at Subscriber’s request or instruction, as provided for in this DPA or as required by law.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION</strong>.</p>
<p>8.1.&nbsp.
ACG will (a) notify Subscriber of a Personal Data Breach without undue delay after becoming aware of the Personal Data Breach, and (b) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Personal Data Breach.</p>
<p>8.2.&nbsp.
To assist Subscriber in relation to any Personal Data breach notifications Subscriber is required to make under the Data Protection Laws, ACG will include in the notification under Section 8.1(a) such information about the Personal Data Breach as ACG is reasonably able to disclose to Subscriber, taking into account the nature of the Services, the information available to ACG, and any restrictions on disclosing the information, such as confidentiality.</p>
<p>8.3.&nbsp.
Subscriber agrees that:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp.
An unsuccessful Personal Data Breach will not be subject to this Section.
An unsuccessful Personal Data Breach is one that results in no unauthorized access to Personal Data or to any of ACG’s equipment or facilities storing Personal Data, and may include, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on firewalls or edge servers, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, denial of service attacks, packet sniffing (or other unauthorized access to traffic data that does not result in access beyond headers) or similar incidents.
and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp.
ACG’s obligation to report or respond to a Personal Data Breach under this Section is not and will not be construed as an acknowledgment by ACG of any fault or liability of ACG with respect to the Personal Data Breach.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp.
Notification(s) of Personal Data Breaches, if any, will be delivered to one or more of Subscriber’s account administrators or other contact information provided in the Agreement by any reasonable notification means, including via email.&nbsp.
It is Subscriber’s sole responsibility to ensure Subscriber’s administrators and contacts maintain accurate contact information on the Subscriber account at all times.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp.
Subscriber will cooperate in good faith with ACG’s reasonable and lawful requests, within Subscriber’s reasonable control, to assist in mitigating the effects and minimizing any damage resulting from a Personal Data Breach.</p>
<p>
<strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>AUDITS</strong>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>9.1.&nbsp.
ACG shall permit Subscriber (or its appointed third party auditors), at Subscriber’s cost, to audit ACG’s compliance with this DPA or Data Protection Laws, and shall make available to Subscriber all information, systems and staff under the direct control of ACG reasonably necessary for Subscriber (or its third-party auditors) to conduct such audit upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, but solely as such audit relates to ACG’s processing of the Personal Data (not any other aspect of ACG’s business or information systems).
ACG acknowledges that it will provide Subscriber (or its third-party auditors) all necessary information and personnel as may be required to conduct such audit.
provided however, that (a) such audit and the derivative work product produced in response to such audit shall at all times be subject to the provisions set forth in the confidentiality provisions set forth in the Agreement and (b) Subscriber will not have the right to audit, review, inspect or access any third party vendor or subcontractor site, but ACG will have a duty to seek to arrange a site visit when required by a governmental authority.&nbsp.
Subscriber will make every effort to cooperate with ACG to schedule such audits at times that are convenient to ACG and Subscriber may not exercise its audit rights more than once in any twelve (12) calendar month period, except (i) if and when required by the instruction of a competent data protection authority.
or (ii) Subscriber reasonably believes a further audit is necessary due to a Personal Data Breach suffered by ACG.</p>
<p>9.2.&nbsp.
ACG will reasonably assist Subscriber with meeting Subscriber’s compliance obligations under the Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature of ACG’s processing and the information available to ACG, including in relation to Data Subject rights, data protection impact assessments and reporting to and consulting with supervisory authorities under the Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>9.3.&nbsp.
If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, nothing in this Section varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses nor affects any supervisory authority’s or data subject’s rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p>
<strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>PERSONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>10.1.&nbsp.
Subscriber agrees that ACG will have the right to transfer personal Personal Data to ACG or its affiliates located in the United States, the United Kingdom, and/or Australia.&nbsp.
Except for the foregoing transfers to ACG or its affiliates, ACG shall not transfer the Personal Data (nor permit the Personal Data to be transferred) to any jurisdiction other than those to which transfers are permitted under the Data Protection Laws unless ACG has first obtained Subscriber’s prior written consent and takes such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with Data Protection Laws.
Such measures may include (without limitation) transferring the Personal Data to a recipient in a country that the European Commission has decided provides adequate protection for Personal Data, to a recipient that has achieved binding corporate rules authorization in accordance with Data Protection Laws, or to a recipient that has executed standard contractual clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission.&nbsp.
The Standard Contractual Clauses will not apply to Personal Data that is not transferred, either directly or via onward transfer, outside the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>“).</p>
<p>10.2.&nbsp.
If any Personal Data transfer between Subscriber and ACG requires the execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses in order to comply with the Data Protection Laws (where Subscriber is the entity exporting Personal Data to ACG outside the EEA), the parties hereby agree that the Standard Contractual Clauses contained in Annex B shall be effective and further agree to take all other actions required to legitimize the transfer.</p>
<p>10.3.&nbsp.
If Subscriber consents to appointment by ACG located within the EEA of a sub-processor located outside the EEA in compliance with the provisions of Section 6, then Subscriber authorizes ACG to enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses contained in Annex B with the sub-processor on its behalf.&nbsp.
ACG will make the executed Standard Contractual Clauses available to Subscriber on request.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>TERMINATION</strong>

<p>This DPA will remain in full force and effect so long as: (a) the Agreement remains in effect.
or (b) ACG retains any Personal Data related to the Agreement in its possession or control.</p>
<p>
<strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>DELETION OR RETURN OF DATA</strong>.</p>
<p>Upon termination of the Services for which ACG is processing Personal Data, ACG shall delete or return to Subscriber (whichever Subscriber requests) all Personal Data (including all copies) in its possession or control.&nbsp.
This requirement shall not apply to the extent that ACG is required by the European Union, or any European Union Member State, or other country law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, in which event ACG shall protect the Personal Data from any further processing except to the extent required by such law.</p>
<p>
<strong>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>RECORDS</strong>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>13.1.&nbsp.
ACG will keep reasonably detailed, accurate and up-to-date written records regarding any processing of Personal Data it carries out for Subscriber, including but not limited to, the access, control and security of the Personal Data, approved subcontractors and affiliates, the processing purposes, categories of processing, any transfers of Personal Data to a third country and related safeguards, and a general description of the technical and organizational security measures (“<strong>Records</strong>“).</p>
<p>13.2.&nbsp.
ACG will ensure that the Records are reasonably sufficient to enable Subscriber to verify ACG’s material compliance with its obligations under this DPA and ACG will provide Subscriber with copies of the Records upon request.</p>
