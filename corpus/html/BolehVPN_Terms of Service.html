<strong>2.
Bandwidth Usage and Number of Connections<br>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not impose strict bandwidth or speed limits on our servers, this is subject to fair use and shall be within reasonable bandwidth limits of normal residential/light commercial use.
We do not log individual usage or bandwidth though we do monitor general traffic throughput and speeds of our servers to ascertain loading and view traffic patterns.
In the event we notice any unusual loading or abnormal traffic pattern of the server, we may investigate on a more detailed basis to ascertain whether abuse is happening or excessive use.
We reserve the right to terminate users in the event we discover excessive bandwidth usage of our service.
We reserve the right to determine what is excessive use but is typified by consistent, sustained, high bandwidth use of our service for a period of more than 12 hours.</p>
<p>We allow a maximum of 3 simultaneous connections per VPN account.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Security of your Login Details and Certificates/Keys<br>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Access to our VPN services are controlled by a username and password to login to retrieve your certificates and keys.
These certificates and keys then gain you access to our VPN servers.
You agree to keep your username and password and your certificates and keys securely and prevent third parties from using them.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.
Logging Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>BolehVPN does not keep logs of user activity or access.
We do keep logs of general traffic throughput of our servers to ascertain loading and usage of our servers but not at an individual level.
However if we do notice any unusual activity on our servers (high bandwidth loading, high number of connections or cpu usage) we may turn on logs temporarily to identify abuse of our services (such as DoS or spamming through our servers).</p>
<p>Once the user is identified, we will terminate the offending user, issue him an e-mail for the reason of termination and wipe the logs from our system.</p>
<p>Turning on logs for troubleshooting is a very last resort and is necessary to ensure the integrity of our services.
It has happened very rarely (only a handful of times in our 9 years of operation) and such information was not disclosed to third parties but merely used to terminate the offending user.
In any case logs were usually enabled for not more than few hours and only for the particular server that was experiencing abuse.</p>
<p>This does not mean we condone criminal or illegal activities especially when it relates to crimes such as terrorist activities, child pornography, blackmail, online harassment/bullying or any other activities that threaten people’s personal safety or ruin people’s lives.
Please do not use our service if you intend to do any of the above.</p>
