Tor (Anonymity Network).
<p> Frantech is a strong believer and supporter of Freedom of Speech and has taken a strong, and in some cases very public, stance against censorship.
You're welcome to run Exit, Relay, and Bridge nodes, just follow the rules when doing so.
</p>
<br> Tor Guidelines <p> 3,1,1 - Please open a support ticket informing us you're running an Exit Node.
This is to allow us to keep track of abuse complaints that come in and handle them accordingly.
</p>
<p> 3,1,2 - Frantech is extremely fair when it comes to abuse complaints for Tor users.
This is not an invitation to start being malicious.
</p>
<p> 3,1,3 - Please apply Reverse DNS to your IP address through the control panel if you're operating an Exit Node as this can help curb many abuse complaints.
Something as simple as tor.your-domain.tld is likely sufficient.
</p>
<p> 3,1,4 - If you're operating an Exit Node, please make sure your <b>exit policy</b> blocks the following ports: </p>
<ul>
<li>TCP 25 (SMTP)</li>
<li>TCP 465 (SMTP over SSL)</li>
<li>TCP 587 (SMTP over TLS)</li>
<li>TCP 6660-6667 (IRC - Optional but you may save yourself from DDOS attacks)</li>
<li>TCP 6697 (IRC over SSL - Optional but you may save yourself from DDOS attacks)</li>
</ul>
