A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database.
This allows Company to track certain websites you visit.
Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in.
In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Company’s database.<br>(c) IP Addresses.

This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.
Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”).
For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer.
IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns.
While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web.
Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using.
Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.<br>(d) Computer Profiles.
Company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors.
