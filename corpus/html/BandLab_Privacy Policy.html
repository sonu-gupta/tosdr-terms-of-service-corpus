Such Information must be provided in order to register an Account.</p>
<p>2.1.2.
Once your Account has been registered, your name, username and profile picture (if you have signed up using your Social Network ID) will automatically be displayed on your profile page and will be available to other Users through the Services.

In addition to your name and username, which are automatically displayed on your profile page, you may voluntarily provide Information on your profile page such as your profile picture (if not already available via your sign up using your Social Network ID), date of birth, gender, location and other information about yourself and your interests.</p>

Any such Information which you add to your profile page (except for date of birth and gender) on the Services becomes publicly available.
Please exercise personal discretion in how much Information you choose to share.</p>

Analytics Information</p>
<p>2.6.1.
We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services.
These tools collect information sent by your device including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Services.
We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p>2.7.
Cookies and similar technologies</p>
<p>2.7.1.
The Services may contain “cookies”, clear gifs (also known as “web beacons” or “web bugs”), or similar technology.
A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser, which will store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies.
Web beacons assist in the delivery of cookies and the collection of non-personally identifiable information, such as “click path” and other data as described above.</p>
<p>2.7.2.
The Services use cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies as they are developed to customise your experience with our website and services.
Most Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
You should refer to your browser instructions or “Help” screen to learn more about how to manage cookies.
Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some services and portions of this website may not function properly.</p>
<p>2.8.
Log file information</p>
<p>2.8.1.
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app.
It can also be provided when the content of a web page or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>2.8.2.
When you use the Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Services, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then helps us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Services.</p>
<p>2.9.
Device identifiers</p>
<p>2.9.1.
When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access the Services, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, that uniquely identify your mobile device.
A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us.</p>
<p>2.9.2.
A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a Third Party partner about how you browse and use the Services and may help us or others provide reports or personalised content and ads.
Some features of the Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
3.
How we use your Information
<p>3.1.
How we use your Information will depend on the nature of your interaction with the Services and with us.
We need to have valid grounds to process your Information.
Most times, we would seek your consent, like when you register for an Account or subscribe to our mailing list.
Other times, when you reasonably expect us to use your Information, we will not ask for your consent, but only when it is legally permissible for us to do so (e.g.
it is necessary for our performance of a contract, or for us to comply with a legal obligation etc.).
Generally, we collect and use Information for the following purposes:</p>
<p>a) To allow you, and those whom you have given permissions to, to access Content and Information which you have uploaded;</p>
<p>b) To identify you with Content which you have uploaded;</p>
<p>c) To remember Information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Services;</p>
<p>d) To provide personalised Content to you and others such as Followers and Band Members or other interest segment updates, personalised online advertisements or other forms of marketing like emails about products, services and other information you might be interested in.

<p>3.2.
For clarity, you’re granting us permission to use your Information for the above-mentioned purposes (through your use of the Services) not only allows us to provide the Services as they exist today, but also to provide you with new capabilities as we develop the Services in the future.</p>
<p>3.3.
Apart from the above purposes, we may also notify you of other purposes for which we process your Information and seek your consent to such purposes (e.g., when you participate in a survey, provide feedback, enter a competition etc.).</p>
