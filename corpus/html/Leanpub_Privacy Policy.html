<p>Leanpub is a service that is used primarily to buy and sell books and courses.
When a user buys a book or a course, it is made available to them in their Leanpub library.
Since people who buy books and courses through Leanpub expect them to be available for an indefnite period of time, just like a person who buys a physical book and puts it on their bookshelf expects that book to be there the next time they look, we do not delete user information related to such purchases, whether those purchases are paid or free, unless users ask us to delete the information.
</p>
<p>Any relevant information related to a purchase, whether that purchase is paid or free, will be kept as long as necessary to comply with potential legal requirements, including anti-money laundering investigations, tax investigations, fraud investigations, and copyright violations or any potential legal challenges or other proceedings.</p>
<p>To be clear, this means that even if you request to delete your account, if you have sold a Product through Leanpub, whether that purchase is paid or free, we will keep a copy or copies of the Product or Products you have sold, and any other user account information related to it that may be required in potential future legal or other proceedings, including, inter alia, contact information, such as your email address.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you have made a Leanpub purchase (free and/or paid), and you request to have your account deleted, we reserve the right to retain any information that may be required as part of any potential future legal or other proceedings, including, inter alia, contact information, such as your email address.</p>
<p>Except as may be set forth in this Privacy Policy, Online Data related to OBA is retained by Ruboss for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire, subject to certain conditions.
However, the 180 day period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits or interacts with an ad, email, the Services or a Channel.</p> 15.

<p>If you are an EU resident, you may have certain rights including: the right not to provide your Personal Information to us.

Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect.</p>
<p>On some parts of the Service, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list.
If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.</p>
<p>We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running.
Under those circumstances, we will provide you with the ability to turn these off by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.
Please note that your opt out is limited to the device used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions or non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing or Ruboss’s ongoing business relations.</p>
<p>There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications.
These are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.
Some use device identifier or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps.
You can stop all collection of information via our mobile applications by uninstalling them.
Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device (which is usually located in the Settings area of your device).</p>
<p>If we offer you the opportunity to link your Ruboss account with certain third party services, you will be provided with the ability to unlink your accounts at any time by visiting your Leanpub account settings.
Please note that unlinking your accounts will not affect any information previously shared through the linking, and Ruboss may continue to use and share that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Ruboss is not responsible for any third party data practices, and we recommend that you carefully review their online policies.</p>
<p>You may stop or restrict cookies and pixel tags on your computer or purge cookies from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences.

<p>For California Residents: in accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, we may collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use the Services.

California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our users who are California residents to periodically request and obtain certain information about any Personal Information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request or if you wish for us to refrain from gathering your Personal Information, please submit your request in writing to the contact details set out in Section 17 below.</p>

Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases).
Requests should be submitted by contacting us (using the contact instructions in Section 17 below).
If you are an EU resident and have any unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily after contacting us, you have the right to contact the appropriate EU Supervisory Authority and lodge a complaint.</p> 16.
