</ul>Code of ConductLast Revised: November 15th, 2019<p>At Wattpad, we set stories free with the goal of creating a safe and comfortable space for everyone to discover and create.</p>
<p>In order to create an inclusive and respectful space, we want to ensure our Wattpadders know what type of content they will discover as well as content they can or cannot post!</p>
<p>Before you take off on your writing journey, please take a peek at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you create your username, make sure it's not hateful or explicit in nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s important to respect and protect fellow Wattpadder’s feelings, property, and personal information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You shouldn’t post anything you might regret in the future or that your peers, family, or mentors might not want to see online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should read our Content Guidelines, Code of Conduct, Terms of Service, and our Privacy Policy so you have all the information you need to enjoy Wattpad and help others enjoy it too!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you come across any content that violates our guidelines, let us know by reporting it.
See here for how to do that.</p>

Tags (What's the deal with Ratings and Tags?)<p>Wattpad encourages writers to rate and tag their own stories appropriately according to our Content Guidelines.
Appropriately rated and tagged stories will allow the correct audience to discover your story.

For more information on badges and what they mean, please see Badges and Profile Symbols.</p>Back to topBack to topPositive Language (Hold hands, not grudges)<p>Users have the right to determine their level of engagement, as long as they aren’t abusing, harassing, or discriminating against an individual.
Say what you really love doing, rather than what you don't accept.
For example: <q>I love making Romance Covers</q> rather than <q>I won't make FanFic covers.</q> Everyone should feel comfortable interacting with each other on Wattpad, so please remember to treat and talk to people the way you’d like to be treated and talked to.
Remember that even if you don't intend it, your words can be hurtful, discriminatory, or even hateful and a breach our Code of Conduct.
