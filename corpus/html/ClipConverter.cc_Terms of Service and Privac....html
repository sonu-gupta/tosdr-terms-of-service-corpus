<strong>Privacy statement concerning Google +1 button</strong>
</p>
<p> The collection and dissemination of data: The Google +1 button is a way for you to share information publicly with the world.
The Google +1 button helps you and others receive personalized content from Google and our partners.
The fact that you +1'd something will be recorded by Google, along with information about the page you were viewing when you clicked on the +1 button.
Your +1's may appear to others as an annotation with your profile name and photo in Google services (such as in search results or on your Google Profile) or elsewhere on websites and ads on the Internet.
Google is recording information about your +1 activity in order to provide you and other users with a better experience on Google services.
In order to use the Google +1 button, you need to have a public Google Profile visible to the world, which at a minimum includes the name you chose for the profile.
That name will be used across Google services and in some cases it may replace another name you have used when sharing content under your Google Account.
Google may display your Google Profile identity to people who have your email address or other identifying information.
