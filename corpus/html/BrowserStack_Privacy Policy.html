<strong>Introduction.</strong>
<p>Your privacy is of paramount importance to BrowserStack, Inc.
BrowserStack, Inc.
and its affiliates are referred to collectively in this policy as as “<strong>BrowserStack</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>.” Our affiliates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>BrowserStack Inc.
in the United States.</li>
<li>BrowserStack Limited in Ireland.</li>
<li>BrowserStack Software Pvt.
Ltd.
in India.</li>
<li>Perceptual, Inc.
in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p>BrowserStack provides a cloud-based service (the “<strong>Service</strong>”), which is an automated testing platform for testing websites and mobile apps.
We fully respect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with the Service and are committed to being transparent in our dealings with you as to what personal information we will collect and how we will use your personal information.
Also, we only collect and use personal information that is necessary for providing Service and where we have a lawful basis to do so.</p>
<p>We have operations in India, Ireland and in the United States.
The location of BrowserStack’s main establishment in the European Union is Ireland and therefore we consider our lead supervisory authority, for purposes of “one stop shop” oversight over our cross-border data processing, to be the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (“<strong>DPC</strong>”).</p>
<p>Our European Union representative for purpose of this Privacy Policy is:</p>
<p>Nakul Aggarwal<br>BrowserStack Limited<br>8th Floor, Block E, Iveagh Court, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2 Ireland<br>nakul@browserstack.com</p>
<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to describe our practices and procedures in handling “Personal Information” we collect or receive from you.
The term “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an identified or identifiable living natural person, including but not limited to: (i) Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, government identification card number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.
and (ii) information defined as “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” “personal data,” or similar expressions under applicable privacy laws or data security Laws, which include the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (”<strong>GDPR</strong>”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers two kinds of Personal Information: Account-Related Information and Personal Information collected by or in connection with the use of our website.</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>Account-Related Information</strong>” means contact information, payment information, and biographical information about our customers’ representatives and contacts used for marketing, opening new user accounts to use BrowserStack’s Services, and to maintain existing accounts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We collect various categories of Personal Information by or in connection with the use of our websites described in Section 3 below.
Our websites include our main website, our visual testing service page and certain pages hosted by third parties on our behalf, such as pages to apply for jobs at BrowserStack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
We will ask for your consent to be bound by this Privacy Policy as a condition of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing you to register for a BrowserStack account (an “<strong>Account</strong>”) on our website or any mobile application.
Any users who use an Account will also be required to expressly accept this Privacy Policy before first accessing (or before continuing to access) our Service through Your Account.
If you do not agree to these terms you must leave our website immediately, you must discontinue use of any use of our mobile application, and you will not be permitted to create an Account or use the Service.
If you choose to accept this Privacy Policy, we will keep a record of your acceptance.</li>
<li>Submitting a web form to communicate with us or apply for a job on website pages we our vendors host on our behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover “Customer Content.” “<strong>Customer Content</strong>” means (i) data or content in a website or mobile application that a customer chooses to test (and for mobile applications, the application package itself).
(ii) data a customer submits or creates as part of a test, including test scripts and screenshots.
and (iii) any other data a customer submits to BrowserStack in connection with the use of the Services (not including Account-Related Information).</p>
<p>Customer Content does not fall within this Privacy Policy, because the Services are not designed for use with (and do not require) Personal Information included in Customer Content.
In our agreements with customers, they specifically agree not to use the Services to collect, store, process or transmit any Personal Information other than Account-Related Information, and will not submit to the Services any Customer Content containing any Personal Information.</p>
<p>Our website and Services are intended for use by adults.
We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from users under 18 years of age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>International Transfer of Data.</strong>
<p>To comply with European Union data protection laws around international data transfer mechanisms, BrowserStack offers European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet adequacy and security requirements for its customers who operate in the European Union and the United Kingdom.
A copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses is available here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Types of Information We Collect.</strong>
<p>You must register an Account in order to use the Service.
The registration process asks for Account-Related Information: a full name, password, email address, IP address, zip code and last four digits of your credit card (and address and contact details, which are optional).
When you are running tests on BrowserStack, we log additional information like browser used, your latency to remote VM, your plan information, integration used, local, performance numbers etc.

Also, when you submit a web form to communicate with us, we collect your name, email address, and whatever Personal Information you include in the webform’s fields.
When you apply for a job using a web page with a job listing, we collect your name, email address, phone number, postal address, and whatever Personal Information you include in the “cover letter” field you provide or the resume you upload.
We ask for consent for the use of cookies, and we ask for your consent to this Privacy Policy when submitting a communication or job application web form as the legal basis for processing the Personal Information communicated to us.</p>
<p>When you send a web form, email, or other communication to BrowserStack (other than in respect of Personal Information included in support requests), we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Service.
When you submit a job application to BrowserStack, we will process the Personal Information you provide to us in connection with your candidacy for the job for which you applied.
BrowserStack is a “data controller” under applicable data protection law with respect to the Personal Information covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may collect information from potential customers at trade shows or meetings, as well as information obtained by obtaining contact lists from marketing companies.
The basis for receiving such information is the consent of the individual.</p>
<p>Note to California residents: BrowserStack does not currently have a mechanism to take action in response to a “do not track” signal or browser setting.
There is no current standard way of handling such signals.
If and when the industry creates standards for responding to them, BrowserStack will reappraise its handling of “do not track” signals.</p>

By submitting Account-Related Information, you explicitly consent to this transfer, storing or processing.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Account-Related Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

</p>
<ul>
<li>Denying goods or services to the California resident</li>
<li>Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.</li>
<li>Providing a different level or quality of goods or services</li>
<li>Suggesting that the California resident will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services</li>

<strong>Notice to California Residents About “Do Not Track Settings”.</strong>
<p>Under California law, online service providers must say in their privacy policies how they respond to “do not track” settings that users can set in their browser software.
Currently, there is no standard governing what, if anything, a website operator should do when receiving a “do not track” signal.
Accordingly, BrowserStack does not currently take action in response to a “do not track” browser setting.
BrowserStack will revisit this policy accordingly if an industry standard regarding such settings emerges.</p>

If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our website or by sending you a notification in relation to this.
