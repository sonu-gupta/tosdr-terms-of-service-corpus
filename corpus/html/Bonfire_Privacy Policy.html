For example, if a user donates to a political campaign outside of Bonfire, and then logs onto the Bonfire website and purchases a shirt, you as the political campaign seller will be provided with a spreadsheet from Bonfire with that user’s information, the amount donated, the amount paid at time of checkout and the user’s shipping address, which is all the information needed if you wanted to return the money via a mailed check to comply with applicable laws.</li>

POLITICAL CAMPAIGN BUYERS<p>
</p>
<p>﻿﻿If you choose to purchase a shirt from a political campaign seller, please note the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full purchase price you pay for the shirt from a political campaign seller is reportable as a campaign contribution (i.e.
if you spend $20 to buy a campaign T-shirt from Bonfire that cost the campaign $5, you have still made a $20 contribution).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonfire will furnish political campaign sellers with a list of buyers, along with some additional information such as your telephone number, occupation and employer, as well as a detailed breakdown of the purchase total, seller profit from the total and any additional donation added by you.</p>
<p>Bonfire will perform checks to verify political campaigns.</p>
<p>If you are purchasing a shirt from a verified political campaign, then Bonfire must collect your name and contact information, purchase total and any additional donation added by you, and provide it to the political campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to donate additional funds to the campaign, you will be limited to $100 to any given political campaign seller in a single transaction, and the transaction total for all items purchased from that political campaign seller cannot exceed $2,800.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonfire will not ship to any user with a shipping or billing address outside of the United States if you are purchasing a shirt from a political campaign seller.&nbsp;</p>

CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION CREATOR (SELLERS)<p>If you are a charitable organization creator (i.e.
seller), please note the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonfire will perform checks to verify charitable organizations.</p>
<p>Bonfire is not responsible for tracking donations, you as the charitable organization seller are responsible for carrying out those responsibilities and requirements.
