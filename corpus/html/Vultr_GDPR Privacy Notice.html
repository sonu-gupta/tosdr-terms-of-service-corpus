You can see and update most of this data yourself online, or by contacting us directly at http://www.vultr.com/contact/ </li>
<li> Data portability - where we are relying (as the legal basis for processing) upon your consent, or the fact that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract, and the personal data is processed by automatic means, you have the right to receive all such personal data which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.
</li>
<li> Right to restriction of processing - you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal data (that is, allow only its storage) where: <ul>
<li> you contest the accuracy of the personal data, until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy.
</li>
<li> where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal data.
</li>
<li> where we no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require such personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
or </li>
<li> where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below), pending verification as to whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Where your personal data is subject to restriction we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
</li>
<li> You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your habitual residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes applicable law.
</li>
<li> Right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds - where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process personal data, you have the right to object to that processing.
If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.
</li>
<li> Right to object to direct marketing (including profiling) - you have the right to object to our use of your personal data (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use your personal data to invite you to our promotional events.
