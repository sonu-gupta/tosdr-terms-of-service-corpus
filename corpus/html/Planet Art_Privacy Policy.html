<u>Exercising CCPA Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</u>
</b>
<br> To exercise the CCPA access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable CCPA request to us at privacy@pallcprivacy.com.
<br>
<br> Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable CCPA request related to Personal Information about you.
You may also make a verifiable CCPA request on behalf of your minor child.
To designate someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, you may upload proof of the authorization to privacy@pallcprivacy.com.
<br>
<br> You may make a verifiable CCPA request for access or data portability only twice within any 12-month period.
The verifiable CCPA request must: <br>
<ul>
<li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are either the person we collected Personal Information about or their authorized representative, which may include information that you have already provided to us, such as your name and email address.
and</li>
<li>describe your CCPA request with sufficient detail so that we can properly understand your request and respond to it.</li>
</ul> We may not respond to your CCPA request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information is about you or someone you are legally authorized to act on behalf of.
Making a verifiable CCPA request does not require you to create an account with us.
<br>
<br> We will use Personal Information provided in a verifiable CCPA request only to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
</li>
<li>
<b>
<u>CCPA Response Timing and Format</u>
</b>
<br> We endeavor to respond to verifiable CCPA requests within forty-five (45) days of their receipt.
If we require more time (up to 90 days) to respond to your request, we will inform you in writing of the reason and needed extension period.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to the email address you provide on the CCPA Request Form.<br>
<br> Any CCPA disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable CCPA request.
Our response will also explain the reasons we are not complying with your CCPA request, if applicable.
<br>
<br> For CCPA data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.<br>
<br> We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CCPA request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the CCPA request warrants a fee, we will tell you why and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
</li>
<li>
<b>
<u>CCPA Non-Discrimination</u>
</b>
<br> We do not discriminate against California residents for exercising their CCPA rights.

<ul>

<u>Notice Re: EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield, CJEU Schrems II Ruling and EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) </u>
</b>
</p>
<p>We have withdrawn from the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States as further described below.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (CJEU) determined that the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield framework is no longer valid for the transfer of Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S.
(known as the Schrems II decision).
The Schrems II decision also placed additional compliance requirements on the use of EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) for the transfer of EU/EEA Personal Data to the U.S.
by companies subject to Section 702 of the U.S.
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and/or Executive Order 12333 (E.O.
12333).</p>
<p>We know our customers, website visitors, and business partners care deeply about privacy and data security, and we optimize our work to get these issues right.
We’d like to confirm that you can continue to use our Services with regard to EU and EEA Personal Data in compliance with EU law.</p>
<p>
<b>
<u>First</u>
</b>, please know that it is our good-faith belief that the types of EU/EEA Personal Data we collect, use, process, share and/or store in the U.S.
are not of the types of Personal Data that would generally be subject to requests from U.S.
government authorities pursuant to FISA Section 702 and/or E.O.
12333.</p>
<p>
<b>
<u>Second</u>
</b>, please note that as part of our good-faith efforts to comply with applicable data protection laws, we strive to continue to store and process EU, EEA, UK and Swiss Personal Data in Ireland, on servers located in the EU.
In compliance with the GDPR and other applicable laws we also implement data encryption, data minimization, data pseudonymization, and need to know access to Personal Data.</p>
<p>
<b>
<u>Third</u>
</b>, although we have withdrawn from Privacy Shield, we are retaining the data collected during our participation, and are providing adequate protection for such data by another authorized means.</p>
<p>
<b>
<u>Fourth</u>
</b>, when international transfer of Personal Data is necessary to perform a contract with you, or in individual cases for the purposes of our compelling legitimate business interests and in order to comply with our internal policies, contractual and legal obligations.</p>
<p>If you represent one of our service providers or business partners and your organization is a party to an agreement with us that includes EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) for compliance with EU/EEA data protection laws, please contact us at privacy@pallcprivacy.com to discuss whether any updates to our agreement are needed resulting from the <u>Schrems II</u> decision.</p>
<p>Trust is a top priority for us, and we will continue to work vigilantly to ensure that our customers, website visitors, and business partners are able to continue to enjoy the benefits of our Services securely, compliantly, and without disruption.</p>
<b>Your Consent to Transfer of Personal Data</b>
<p>In addition to the above, we may also process, store, and/or transfer Personal Data we collect about you, in and to a country outside the EU including the United States.

<p>By submitting Personal Data or interacting with our Services, you consent to this transfer, storing, and/or processing including in the United States.</p>
