<b>Third Party Links:</b>

<p>
<b>Security of Your Personal Information:</b>
</p>
<p>All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment.
We take precautions to protect PII both online and off-line.
Where our registration/application process prompts Users to enter sensitive data (such as credit card information and/or Social Security Number), and when we store and transmit such sensitive data, that information is encrypted with advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
All of our users' information, not just PII, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to PII.
Furthermore, access to this information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.
Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information.
Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Please note that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software supporting the Site or other websites under the control of Best Day Ever Sweeps constitutes a crime punishable by law.
We will turn over to authorities, any and all evidence relating to a potential breach of security or other abuse against our network, servers, databases or other such supporting equipment or software.
In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your PII.
You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.
Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>

<p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable CA User request related to your personal information.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable CA User request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable CA User request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are: (1) the person about whom we collected personal information.
or (2) an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable CA User request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable CA User request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>
<i>Response Timing and Format</i>
</p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to all verifiable CA User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt thereof.
If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable request.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CA User request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
