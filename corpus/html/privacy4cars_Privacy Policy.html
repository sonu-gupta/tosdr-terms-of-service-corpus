<p>Welcome to Privacy4Cars.

This privacy policy applies only to the information collected through your use of the Mobile Application.</p>
<strong>
<em>General</em>
</strong>
<p>We only process your personal information when we have a lawful basis to do so.
For purposes of this privacy policy, “personal information” is defined as information that identifies, or can be used to identify, an individual.
We collect personal information from individuals using the Mobile Application.
Any references in this policy to “you” or “your” should be interpreted in the context in which the information is processed.</p>
<p>Privacy4Cars is the controller of personal information that you provide about yourself through the Mobile Application.
Our legal bases for processing your personal information include your consent, fulfilment of a contractual obligation, and where we have a legitimate interest to process your personal information, provided that our interests do not outweigh your individual rights and freedoms.
Our legitimate interests include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Protecting and defending our rights and properties, including intellectual property;</li>

<strong>
<em>
<strong>What Information Collected</strong>
</em>
</strong>
<p>There is certain information we need to collect in order for the functions and features of the Mobile Application to properly work.
When you use the Mobile Application, we may ask you for the following information or the right to access such information on your mobile device:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Consumer Account Registration:</strong> When you register a Consumer User Account, we will collect your name, email address, and password.<br>
Business User Account Registration: When you register a Business User Account, we will collect your name, email address, and your role within your business.</li>

<li>
<strong>Camera:</strong> If you wish to scan the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) via 1D or 2D barcode, Mobile Application the Mobile Application needs access to your camera.
The scanned VIN is decoded which enables the Mobile Application to return data-wiping instructions based on Make, Model, and Year of the scanned VIN data and to uniquely determine which vehicles have been wiped.
This may be of particular importance for Business Users (e.g., for compliance purposes).</li>
<li>
<strong>Location:</strong> The Mobile Application asks for access to the User’s location.

We may use this information to reach out to businesses near where Consumer Users wiped their systems (e.g., a dealer, a rental car location) in order to raise their awareness and sensitivity to protecting the privacy of their customers and employees (all data will be aggregated, de-identified, and anonymized).
If you are using the Mobile Application as a Business User, we are required to collect your location based on our agreement with our Customer (the business, company, or legal entity to which your Business User Account is tied).
By registering a Business User Account, you consent to our collection and use of your location data.</li>
<li>
