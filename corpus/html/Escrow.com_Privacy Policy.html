As such, this privacy policy will list both types of information for the sake of transparency.</p>
<p>In some situation users may provide us with personal information without us asking for it, or through means not intended for the collection of particular types of information.
Whilst we may take reasonable steps to protect this data, the user will have bypassed our systems, processes, and control and thus the information provided will not be governed by this privacy policy.</p>
<p>In some situations users may provide us personal information over platforms that are outside our control.
