If User is an advertiser under a “post-payment account” (meaning an account in which User pays for the Services after invoicing by AppLovin), AppLovin will invoice User based on the numbers in AppLovin’s online reporting system, which numbers will be deemed final and payment will be due from User within thirty (30) days of the end of each month.</p>
<p>If User’s payment method fails or User’s account is past due, AppLovin may take steps to collect past due amounts using any available collection mechanisms.
User agrees to pay all expenses associated with such collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
Interest will accrue on any past due amounts at the rate of the lesser of 1% per month or the lawful maximum.</p>
<p>If User is a Publisher, AppLovin will pay User monthly earnings reflected in AppLovin’s online reporting system, subject to the minimum applicable threshold for payment set forth in User’s online account.
Any such payments will be related to valid impressions shown on Publisher’s Mobile Properties and the pricing associated with such impressions, which pricing may include CPM or a percentage of Net Revenue as determined by AppLovin.</p>
<p>“Net Revenue” shall mean revenues actually received by AppLovin from the sale, use or other disposition of advertisements displayed on Publisher’s Mobile Property less sales, use, value added and excise taxes, less any agency commissions, buyer fees, carrier and/or partner fees, and less any allowances actually made or taken for returns, cash discounts or promotional allowances but excluding other revenues indirectly earned, if applicable, for consulting, planning and targeting, copywriting, site building, account management or technical modifications or technical innovations which may be charged by AppLovin to third parties from time to time.
The portion of Net Revenue received by User shall be determined on the first Monday of each calendar month, on which day those revenues accrued to User’s account thirty (30) or more days earlier shall become eligible to be paid.
In the event User’s earnings for any given month is less than the applicable threshold communicated to User via User’s online account, AppLovin reserves the right to roll such payment over month to month until the applicable threshold is met.</p>
<p>All payments will be calculated solely based on AppLovin’s accounting.
Payments to you may be withheld to reflect or adjusted to exclude any amounts refunded or credited to advertisers and any amounts arising from invalid activity, as determined by AppLovin in its sole discretion.&nbsp;Invalid activity is determined by AppLovin in all cases and includes, but is not limited to, (i) spam, invalid impressions or invalid clicks on Advertisements generated by any person, bot, automated program or similar device, including through any clicks or impressions originating from your IP addresses or computers under your control.
(ii) clicks solicited or impressions generated by payment of money and false representation.
(iii) clicks or impressions co-mingled with a significant amount of the activity described in (I and ii) above, or (iv) any breach of this Agreement by User.

<p>AppLovin reserves the right to change its fees and to institute new charges at any time, upon prior notice to User.

AppLovin’s fees do not include Taxes (defined below) and User agrees to pay all applicable Taxes imposed by any government entity in connection with User’s use of the Services.
In the event that any authority requires that Taxes be withheld on payments made by User hereunder, User shall pay such Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority in addition to the full amount owed to AppLovin and without deduction from the amount owed to AppLovin.
User may provide&nbsp;AppLovin with an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority, in which case AppLovin will not charge or collect the Taxes covered by such certificate.
“Taxes” shall mean any direct or indirect local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies (including any equalization levy), duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including VAT, excise, sales, use, consumption and withholding taxes.</p>
<p>Subject to the foregoing, AppLovin will pay User’s monthly earnings within 15 days of the end of each calendar month based on the payment details entered into User’s AppLovin account.</p> 8.
