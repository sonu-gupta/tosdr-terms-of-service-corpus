Accordingly, we ask that you bookmark and periodically review this Privacy Policy to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version.
If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy&nbsp;Policy,&nbsp;we request that you immediately cease using and accessing the Service and/or the Among Us Web Pages.</p>
<p>
<strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Among Us collects information from you in two ways: information you give to us, and information that we gather from your use of our Service,&nbsp;collectively known as&nbsp;“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”.&nbsp;PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.&nbsp;Such information is made up of “Personal Information” and “Non-Personal Information.”</p>
<p>“Personal Information” means information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your first and last name, email address, physical address, telephone number, billing information, or social security number.</p>
<p>“Non-Personal Information” means information that does not specifically identify you.</p>
<p>
<strong>The information</strong>
<strong> you give to us.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect information that you give to us.
For example, as part of our Service, you may elect to provide us with your email address or other information to receive newsletters and other notifications about certain features of our Service.
Such registration may include your disclosure to us of Personal Information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information we gather from your use of our Service.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>We, like many websites and applications, collect information about what parts of our Service you use and how you use them.
Information we may gather includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer or browser information such as your system activity, the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our Service and/or the Among Us Web Pages, the time and duration of your use of our Service and any queries, browser type, and browser language.</li>
<li>Device information such as your hardware model, operating system, operating system version, mobile device type, unique identifiers from your computer or mobile device, application download information, and/or IP address.</li>
<li>Location information such as your geolocation when you use our Service from a mobile device and/or mobile application.
We may ask for you to manually provide precise location information or to enable your mobile device to send us precise location information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may use unique identifiers, Flash cookies, web beacons, web server log information, or other technologies to collect information about you.
In addition to the information that we collect from you for our own Service, we may collect information from you for third parties for purposes such as ad targeting, optimization, and reporting.</p>
<p>
<strong>OUR INFORMATION USE&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect information from you and our other users to administer our business activities and to measure and improve our Service.
In addition, information collected from end-users may be used in aggregate form to, among other things, determine the total number of end-users who are using our Service, diagnose and fix compatibility problems or other problems with our Service, and perform statistical analyses to enable us to build higher quality, more useful online services and content.
We may use the information collected from you to show advertising and promotions tailored to your interests.
If you submit a request for information about Among Us through our web site, we may use your e-mail address to assist you with any issues you may have or to send you an e-mail that gives you the opportunity to elect to receive periodic e-mail alerts from Among Us regarding developments at the company.
In addition, if you elect to receive promotional information from Among Us by registering for our newsletter and other notifications, we will use the information you provided to Among Us to send you only promotions that will be most relevant to you.</p>
<p>We may also use your e-mail address to send you important notices.
Because this information is important to your use of our Service, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.</p>
<p>We may combine your Personal Information that we have with other information that we obtain from business partners or other companies.
We may also combine your Personal Information with Non-Personal Information.
If we do so, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
<p>

Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server that placed them there.
We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service (for example, by fulfilling your language, filtering and other preferences) and to better understand how people interact with our Service (for example, by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search).

<p>We currently use the services of web analytics companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our Service, including the advertising on the Service.
To do this, we allow the web analytics companies to include Web beacons and cookies on the Among Us Web Pages.
The type of information collected via such Web beacons and cookies includes search terms, search parameters, click-throughs by users, and other similar information.
By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like user preferences, popular search categories, click-through rates, how to improve our Service, and what kinds of offers our users like to see.
Although our web analytics companies log this information on our behalf, we control how that data may be used.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the advertisements appearing on the Service, are delivered to you by one of our Web advertising partners (“Ad Serving Partners”).&nbsp;In the course of&nbsp;delivering such advertisements, our Ad Serving Partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, or place web beacons, JavaScript or other similar technologies on our Service for the purpose of collecting information.
Thereafter, information about your visits to the Service, such as your search terms or phrases or the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information), is used to deliver targeted advertisements to you, a practice commonly known as “behavioral advertising.” The information collected by our Ad Serving Partners through cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies is anonymous, and our Ad Serving Partners are not authorized to collect any Personal Information about you.

<p>
<strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>CalOPPA&nbsp;is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.
– See more at http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
<li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
<li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
<li>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:&nbsp;On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
<li>Can change your personal information:&nbsp;By emailing us&nbsp;or by logging into your account&nbsp;should we&nbsp;provide that feature.</li>
<li>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Fair Information Practices&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;be in line with Fair Information Practices we will&nbsp;notify you via email within 7 business days&nbsp;should a data breach occur.&nbsp;We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
<p>

<strong> Act&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
<p>We collect your email address&nbsp;in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
