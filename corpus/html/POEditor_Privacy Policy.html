         <p>We know that you care about your personal data and how it is used.
We do too.

<p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to marketers or unaffiliated third parties.
We only share some of your personal data with trusted entities if it's absolutely necessary, as outlined below.</p>
When you register:
<ul>
<li>We collect <b>email addresses</b> for the account system.
Every account is unique due to the uniqueness of the email address, which is used to identify you as a user, log you in, notify you, connect you with your collaborators.</li>
<li>We collect <b>names</b> in order to make the interaction between you and your collaborators easier.</li>
<li>We collect <b>IP addresses</b> in order to detect the misuse of the system, combat abuse, and for logging purposes.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<li>When you connect to Slack or Microsoft Teams, we do not collect any personal data, the information only goes one way, from POEditor to your chat client.</li>
</ul> How long is the data processed
<p> The processing starts when you create an account and ends when you delete it or ask us to remove the data.</p> Where your personal data is stored
<p> The majority of our users are from the EU, so all the data is stored in data centers in EU countries for optimal performance.
The only personal data that leaves the EU is the name and email we send to our payment processor, Stripe, which is located in the US.
All other third party services are located within the EU.</p> What do we do to safeguard the data
