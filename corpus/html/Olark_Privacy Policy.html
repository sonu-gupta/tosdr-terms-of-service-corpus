Cookies

<p>Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser.
Third party tools in the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser and we may use Flash cookies (or local shared objects) to store your preferences or use on the Services to personalize your visit.
We do not control how third-party cookies are used.

Olark does assign each user a unique user ID within the scope of an individual website, but does not collect or retain IP or any information except information users volunteer (for example, an email or credit card number) which would allow Olark to identify the same particular user on more than one website.
For the purposes of abuse and fraud prevention, Olark may use Customer End User IP during a chat session to block fraudulent IPs, trolls, and prevent other abuse.
this IP information will be destroyed after the session, including logs destroyed after 7 days.</p>
