<strong>What are cookies?</strong>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer, tablet or smartphone by websites that you visit.
They are generally used to make websites function, or function more efficiently.
They can allow you to access information that, perhaps, is limited to you as a registered user, or to remember your preferences, or record what you have put in your shopping basket.
They also provide information to those operating a website, for example counting the number of people looking at a website, where they come from, the type of browser/device they use.</p>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies on this Website to personalize content and to analyze our traffic.</p>
<p>By using and browsing this Website, you consent to cookies being used in accordance with this Cookie Policy.
If you do not consent, you must turn off cookies or refrain from using the Website.
You can turn off cookies in most browsers, but doing so may restrict your use of this Website and/or delay or affect the way in which it operates.</p>
<p>Different browsers provide different means of configuring how cookies are handled.

<p>
<strong>Who sets these cookies?</strong>
</p>
<p>Both first-party and third-party cookies are used on this Website.</p>
<p>First-party cookies are cookies set by us and which enable the Website to work as you might expect it to.
They are also used to give us anonymised data about how our Website is being used, the browser, the type of device accessing it and where, generally, the device is located.</p>
<p>Third-party cookies are set by others, but may also enable us to learn more about our visitors/customers, allowing us to provide a more personalised service, or in connection with advertising.</p>
<p>We will ask for your permission to place cookies or other similar on your device, except where it is essential for us to use them in order to provide you with a service that you have requested.</p>

<strong>Cookies for measuring performance of the website</strong>
</p>
<p>By understanding how people use the Xapo website, we can make improvements to the navigation and content to make the site better and easier to access.</p>
<p>We use cookies that allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it.
This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</p>
<p>We use Unbounce cookies to collect information about how visitors interact with our site and landing pages.
We use the information to compile reports and run A/B tests to determine which landing pages a visitor has visited and how they use our site.
The cookies collect information in an anonymous form.</p>

<p>We also use Hotjar to gather data on where users are clicking on pages and how they are viewing single and multiple pages.
We use the information to compile reports and to help us improve the website.
The cookies collect information in an anonymous form.</p>

<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Name: _hjRecordingLastActivity</strong>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>

<p>Expires:&nbsp;This cookie expires when the visitor's browser session is closed.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>For how long do our cookies last?</strong>
</p>
<p>The cookies we use last for different lengths of time.
This depends upon the purpose for which they are used.</p>
<p>Session cookies are temporary cookies which are stored only until you leave the Website, or you close your web browser.</p>
<p>Persistent cookies last for a fixed period of time, defined within the cookie, and allow the Website to recognise the device again when the user returns to that website on that device.</p>
