</ul>Definitions<p>There are several definitions in the GDPR.
The most important definitions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable <em>natural</em> person</li>
<li>‘processing’ means any operation […] on personal data […] such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction</li>
</ul>
<p>If we talk about your personal data in the following, we mean anything that can be used to identify you.
Examples are your name, e-mail address, and IP address.
When we talk about “processing of personal data,” we mean any type of processing.</p>Personal data we process<p>When you visit our website, your <strong>IP address</strong> and user-agent are automatically processed by our web server.
We automatically get this data from your client (e.g., your web browser or RSS/Atom feed reader).
Our web server needs your IP address to send our contents back to your client.
By default, we do not process any other personal data from you.
Furthermore, our web server doesn’t store your IP address permanently (e.g., in log files).</p>
<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data, as explained above, is Article 6(1) f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest is providing our content.</p>Logging<p>Our web server writes information about particular client-side requests to so-called log files.
We use these log files to detect attack-like behavior and to improve our services.
Our web server automatically encrypts all log files after one day using public-key cryptography.
The encrypted log files are automatically deleted after ten days.</p>
<p>In case of abnormal requests (for technical people: all HTTP status codes except 200, 302, 304), we only log the following.
Unusual requests include repeated attempts to access denied files or other attack-like behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>timestamp ("[31/Dec/2016:12:01:10 +0100]")</li>
<li>IP address (“123.123.123.123”)</li>
<li>HTTP status code (“403”)</li>
<li>bytes transmitted (“157”)</li>
<li>first line of request for each request/HTTP version (“GET /secrets.bak HTTP/1.1)</li>
<li>user-agent (“Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1.
rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0”)</li>
<li>in some cases, our web application firewall also logs full client-side requests and full server-side responses</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this data to identify new attacks, audit blocked requests, and unblock legitimate users, if necessary.
We store blocked IP addresses for 14 days.
We also use this data to identify broken links (for technical people: HTTP status code 404).</p>
<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data, as explained in this section, is Article 6(1) f GDPR.
Our legitimate interests are blocking attacks and improving our services.</p>Personal data third parties process for us<p>The following third parties process personal data for us:</p>netcup GmbH, Germany<p>The netcup GmbH (read their privacy policy) provides our servers.
The netcup GmbH may log access attempts (IP address, user-agent) for all of its customers (including us) to detect DDoS attacks, attack-like behavior, and so on.</p>
<p>We concluded a data processing agreement according to Article 28 GDPR with netcup GmbH.</p>
<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is Article 6(1) f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest and the interest of the netcup GmbH is detecting/blocking attack-like behavior and proving our content.</p>Tutao GmbH, Germany (e-mail only)<p>The Tutao GmbH (read their privacy policy) provides our mail server.

<strong>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point e or f of Article 6(1) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions.
We no longer process the personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of you or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
