The searches will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit.
We may use scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity.</p>
<p>Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially, may be used by Able Insurance Services Limited and other companies if you, or other members of your household, apply for other facilities including insurance, loans applications and claims.
This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account.
Alternatively, we may ask you to provide physical forms of identification.</p>
<p>We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account with us.
Information on applications will be sent to and recorded by CRAs.
Records remain on file for six years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.</p>
<p>If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect or identify fraud, we will record it and may also pass this information to FPAs and other organisations involved in the prevention of crime and fraud.</p>
<p>If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services and financing you have requested, or to employ you, or we may stop providing existing services to you.</p>

When you tell us about an incident we will pass information to the Registers.</p>
<p>Information relating to your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB).
MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic Licensing</li>
<li>Continuous Insurance Enforcement.

<p>It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number.
If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the Police.
You can check that your correct registration number details are shown on the MID at&nbsp;www.askmid.com, or by writing to:</p>
