         Terms of service <p>Last updated August 6, 2020</p> Welcome to Handshake!
<p>We are a career services platform that connects students and employers to democratize the job finding experience in college and beyond.</p>
<p> This Terms of Service applies to your use of the joinhandshake.com website and the Handshake Service (collectively “the Handshake Service” or “the Service”), as well as your relationship with Stryder Corp.
(“Handshake”).
</p>
<p> If you do not agree with these Terms, including the Binding Arbitration Clause and a Class Action waiver included below, please discontinue using the Service.
</p>
<p> These Terms will change over time.
If we make minor changes to the Terms without materially changing your rights, we will post the modified Terms on our website.
We will notify you by email, through the Handshake Service, or by presenting you with a new Terms of Service to accept if we make a modification that materially changes your rights.
When you use the Handshake Service after a modification is posted, you are telling us that you accept the modified terms.
</p>
<p> If you have a written agreement with Handshake that states that it supersedes this Terms of Service (for example if you are a University or Employer Partner), then to the extent there is any conflict between the documents, the provisions in your separate agreement apply.
</p>
<p> Handshake takes user privacy seriously and does not permit third parties to bulk collect student data, employer data, job descriptions, or other marketplace information from our Services through the use of automated scripts (“scraping”), similar or other technologies or methodologies.
For more information on our privacy practices, please read our Privacy Policy.
</p>
Account Creation
<p> You need to have an account to use Handshake.
You can create an account on Handshake as a student seeking a job or career advice, as an employer looking for exciting new talent, or as a career center professional.
You agree not to misrepresent any information about yourself in creating or using an account.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Creating a Student Account Associated With Your University:</strong> You may create your Student Account because you are a student at a Handshake University Partner (“University Partner”).
University Partners use Handshake as a service provider to manage their internal and external career center functions, such as scheduling meetings with students, arranging events, and passing resumes to interested employers.
When University Partners sign up for Handshake, they send us personal information about their students so that Handshake can provide these services.
</p>
<p> Your University will send you an email with information about how to enable your Student Account.
After you do so, and we confirm your association with our University Partner, we pre-populate some areas of your profile with information your University has provided.
We encourage you to review this information for accuracy and completeness.
Some of this information may be locked by your University and you cannot edit it using Handshake.
If any inaccuracies are found, please update the information or contact your University accordingly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Creating a Student Account Not Associated With a University Partner:</strong> You may create an account on Handshake if your school is not a University Partner by using your .edu email address.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Creating an Employer Account:</strong> To create an Employer Account you must either associate yourself with a current Handshake Employer Partner (“Employer Partner”) and be approved by that employer or create a new Employer Account.
Employer Partners do not have access to any student profiles unless they are approved by Handshake, or the student’s University, to access student information that the student chooses to share.
</p>
<p> You have the option to provide additional information when creating your account, such as a profile picture or professional skills, and to upload documents, such as your resume or transcript.
Any information or content you upload directly to the Handshake Service is governed by these Terms.
</p>
<p> You agree that any information you provide through account registration is accurate, current, and complete, and you agree to update your information as necessary to maintain its truth and accuracy.
Also, please note you are prohibited from creating an account for anyone other than yourself, unless you have received express authorization from an employer or client to do so on their behalf.
</p>
<p> To create a student account, you must be at least 16 years old to use this Service.
If you are not 16 years of age, please have a parent or legal guardian fill out this form and submit it here to use the Service.
</p>
Student Account Guidelines
<p> Your Handshake profile is your first impression for employers around the country.
As a rule of thumb, <strong>keep your content and communications on Handshake professional</strong>.
Specifically, you are not allowed to post any violent, nude, discriminatory, hateful, or sexually suggestive photos or other similar content via the Service.
You are responsible for all content you upload to Handshake.
</p>
<p> Handshake allows you to view profiles and send messages to other students and employers through the Service, including students at other Universities or institutions.
You agree not to stalk, defame, bully, harass, abuse, threaten, intimidate, or impersonate other people or entities.
You also agree not to use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, including spam, copyright infringement, identity theft, or fraud.
</p>
<p> You agree you will not attempt to restrict another user from using or enjoying the Service and you must not encourage or facilitate violations of these Terms of Service or any other Handshake terms.
</p>
Making Your Profile “Public” or “Private”
<p> Students are given the choice to set their profile as “private” or “public” when they first activate or create their Handshake account.
When a student sets their profile to “public,” they can also control the general audiences that can access and view their profile.
For Student Accounts initiated by University Partners, student information provided to Handshake by the University is private by default.
</p>
<p> If a profile is set to “private,” employers and other students will not be able to see any information about you.
Where available, all Career Center features, such as scheduling and appointments, are still accessible to private profiles.
You may still apply for job opportunities when your profile is set to private.
When you submit an application for a job with your profile set to private, limited information provided by you or directly by your University will become visible to that specific employer—including your name, the University you attend, and your educational college (engineering, liberal arts, etc.)—but any other personal information in your profile will be hidden or masked, including your profile photo, GPA, sponsorship status, professional skills, personal bio, and resume.
</p>
<p> You can change your privacy settings at any time while your account is active by opening User Settings from the Account Dashboard.
This includes changing your profile from public to private, or making your GPA, which is private by default, public.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Recording of Handshake Communications</strong>
</p>
<p> Wiretapping laws in some U.S.
states prohibit recording individuals without their awareness and consent.
You may not initiate an audio or video recording of any third party in violation of the law.
By initiating any audio or video recording through the Service, you represent and warrant that you have express permission from all persons appearing in the audio or video recording for all potential uses by Handshake of such audio or video recording where required by law.
You agree that you will not hold us responsible and we will not be liable for your failure to inform others that you are recording them and/or your failure to obtain their prior consent.
</p>
Continuing Support
<p> Handshake is committed to helping you succeed in the professional world during school and beyond.
After you graduate or leave your University, we encourage you to update your contact information with a personal email address, so you won’t lose access to your profile once your student email address expires, and to keep your profile current.
Any information you share directly with Handshake is subject to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
</p>
Creating an Employer Account
<p> When you create a Handshake Employer Account, we request contact information, including email address and telephone number, to provide a point of contact for Universities and administrative staff and which will be made available on your public profile.
You have the option to set your profile as “public” or “private” during account creation, and may change your account visibility at any time by opening User Settings from the Account Dashboard.
We will not use your phone number to send any commercial or marketing messages to you from third parties.
You agree to provide accurate and current information and to correct any misrepresentations immediately upon discovery.
</p>
<p> When you create a Handshake Employer Account, all universities will have access to information used to create the account.
Students will only have access to that information if you make your profile public.
Once your account has been approved by participating Universities, you will receive student data through our Service.
You are prohibited from disclosing or sharing this information with other parties, and agree to keep student data confidential.
You shall only use student data to provide the employer services to the student and not use, sell, or disclose Handshake Data for any purposes including data analytics, data monetization, advertising, marketing or any other purpose even if such Handshake Data is aggregated or de-identiﬁed.
You agree to handle and maintain collected student data with equivalent or superior standards as those described in our Privacy Policy, including the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 regarding any Student Personal Data you receive from Handshake.
</p>
<p> You also agree not to use the Service to send spam or other unauthorized communications, and you agree not to use any collected student data for purposes not authorized by Handshake.
These prohibitions are addressed in further detail below.
</p>
Employer Account Guidelines
<p> Through the use of the Service, you will be able to search and filter student results based on a wide range of criteria.
You agree to maintain a fair and equitable recruitment process when selecting student candidates.
You also agree not to discriminate based on ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or veteran status as prohibited by law.
You have the ability to contact students directly through the Service.
By using this Service, you agree not to stalk, defame, bully, harass, abuse, threaten, intimidate, or impersonate any people or entities.
</p>
<p> Employer Accounts are administered by designated Account Administrators.
If the employer chooses to allow additional individual employees to access the Handshake Service through the Employer Account, you agree that the account administrators are responsible for the use of the Service by those individual employees, including requests related to personal data collected from those individual employees.
You acknowledge and agree that Handshake is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than these Terms or our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p> You acknowledge and agree, moreover, that, to ensure your compliance with these Terms, Handshake may review the application flow associated with any new post before it becomes available to applicants on the Handshake Service.
</p>
Third Party Recruiter Guidelines
<p> Handshake is excited to offer as many career opportunities to students as possible, including those offered by third party recruiters.
However, we do not permit outside services to bulk collect student data, employer data, job descriptions, or other marketplace information through the use of automated scripts (“scraping”), or similar or other technologies or methodologies.
To protect our users and their data privacy, moreover, you may not use the data of students or other users for the purpose of marketing any employment opportunities other than the opportunity the applicant applied to through the Handshake Service.
For the same reason, you may not store any student’s or other user’s data for the purpose of (1) marketing employment opportunities to the applicant in the future.
or (2) allowing any third party to use the data for marketing or any other reason.
Third party recruiters are also prohibited from requiring students to create an account on a third-party platform unaffiliated with the company or brand providing the employment role.
Any violation of these or any other Terms, at our discretion, may result in suspension or termination of the account(s) associated with you or your recruitment service.
</p>
No Spam
<p> We want Handshake to be a platform where employers and recruiters can connect with students and other users in a way that is productive for all involved.
To that end, while we allow employers and recruiters to contact students and other users, we do not allow you to use the Service to send unsolicited marketing messages or broadcasts (i.e., spam).
</p>
<p> Spam can take many forms, and our rules are meant to address a wide range of inappropriate content or messaging, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Unsolicited messages that aim to drive traffic or attention from the Handshake Service to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives not directly related to a job opportunity posted on the platform.
</li>
<li>Bulk or repeated identical messages, or high-volume messages with a low student response rate.
</li>
<li>Messages that fail to comply with applicable anti-spam laws and regulations.
</li>
</ul>
<p> If we determine that you have sent spam or other unauthorized content, we may take any action we deem necessary to protect our users’ experience or the Service, including demanding that you cease violating these Terms, suspending your student messaging privileges, or suspending or terminating your account(s).
</p>
Career Center Accounts
<p> Career Centers retain access to data as part of their administrative duties.
Career Center employees are able to view any student profile associated with their University, including hidden data and private profiles.
</p>
