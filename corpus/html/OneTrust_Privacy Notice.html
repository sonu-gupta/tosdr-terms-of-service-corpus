</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Personal Information has been collected as (i) you interacted or used our Website, (ii) you registered and/or attended our Events, and/or (iii) part of the Services, your Personal information, as stored in our CRM service provider, may be enriched or updated to ensure it is accurate and up to date, and achieves the purpose for which it was originally collected.
Please note that the information used to enrich and update your Personal Information, as obtained from the use of third parties’ data sets, does not constitute Personal Information, but merely amounts to data elements related to your organization’s name, structure, industry, and similar attributes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that we may also obtain non-personal information related to your organization’s name, structure, industry, and similar attributes through the use of third parties’ data sets, for the purpose of enriching or updating your Personal Information we already hold.</p>
<strong>How and on what grounds do we use your Personal Information?</strong>
<strong>Personal Information we collect directly from you on our Websites or Events:</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use the Personal Information we collect through our Websites:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>As part of our efforts to keep our Websites secure.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our use of your Personal Information may be based on our legitimate interests to ensure network, information security, and business performance improvement.
Our direct marketing purposes are based on your consent (for example when you request a demo, contact us directly, provide us your business card, agree to receive communications after an Event, and similar circumstances).
We may also rely on our legitimate interests to improve business and marketing practices or contact you to offer similar Services or products that you may have bought from us, requested a demo, or negotiated with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Personal Information we collect directly from you as part of the administration of our Services:</strong>

The OneTrust apps (the “Apps”) are the sub-domains of our Websites.
Therefore, the preferences signaled on our Websites (through the cookies banner and preference centre) will be reflected on the Apps.

For more information about our use of cookies and other trackers visit the OneTrust Cookie Notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use your Personal Information in this context based on the Agreement that we have in place with you or our legitimate interests, typically, either for security purposes or business practice improvement (e.g., the prevention and investigation of fraudulent activities).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provision of Personal Information in these instances may be necessary to enable our proper execution of the Agreement.
Failure to provide Personal Information may cause some services to become unavailable.
