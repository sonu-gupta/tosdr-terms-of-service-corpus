        Although we are based outside North America and not governed by U.S.
or Canadian law, we have adopted and reasonably implemented policies in an effort to voluntarily comply with anti-infringement laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") or the Copyright Modernization Act ("CMA").
Pursuant to such policies, we assert safe harbor from liability related to alleged copyright infringement committed by third parties.
Therefore, we will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of users who we believe, in our sole and absolute discretion, are repeat copyright infringers, pursuant to our voluntary compliance of laws like the DMCA or CMA.
