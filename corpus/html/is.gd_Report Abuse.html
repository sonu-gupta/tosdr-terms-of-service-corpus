</p>
<p>If you'd like a response please state this clearly at the beginning of your email since we do not typically reply to abuse reports (although we read them all and take action where appropriate).</p>
<p>We aim to deal with abuse reports within 24 hours, but often manage much better.
We will typically respond to reports by disabling affected shortened links and adding their destinations to our blacklist if appropriate.</p>
