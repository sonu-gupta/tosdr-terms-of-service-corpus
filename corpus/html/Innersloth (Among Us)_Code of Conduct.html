        
INNERSLOTH CODE OF CONDUCT <p>Innersloth is dedicated to providing a safe, enjoyable, and encouraging space for our community to play our games.
</p>
<p>All of us are responsible for creating and contributing to a positive community, so please familiarize yourself with the Code of Conduct and interact in a way that reflects the values and responsibilities in it.
You will be held accountable for your actions regardless of whether or not you’ve read this.
Whether you’re playing our games or chatting online, we love to see you cheer each other on and interact.</p> EXPECTATIONS <p>All our players deserve to be a part of our community and play Among Us free from harassment, abuse, and hatred.
However, that is the bare minimum expectation.
We encourage all players to work together to prevent harm and create a positive environment for everyone.</p>
<p>In order to create a great game experience and a better community, familiarize yourself with the points below.
Note that bad faith reports or weaponization of any of the rules will result in enforcement of consequences.</p> BEHAVIOUR <p>We ask that you be kind, respectful, and excellent to each other in game – whether that’s via text or voice chat.
This is your community as much as it ours!</p>
<p>Here are some non-exhaustive examples of how you can create a better player experience:</p>
<p>:)</p>
<ul>
<li>Kindness is a continual, active effort.
Be accepting of other people’s abilities, hold each other accountable, lend a helping hand, and encourage each other.
</li>
<li>If you’re asked to stop using a term during a game, then stop, even if you don’t think it’s offensive! Don’t assume everyone always understands your intent or meaning - we have a global community.
</li>
<li>Respect people’s boundaries and own up to your mistakes.
If you’ve upset someone with your language, apologizing is always a great way of mending the bridge! </li>
<li>If you are being harassed, we recommend you disengage, report, and leave.
They do not deserve your emotional energy and it can often lead to more harassment if not handled properly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>:(</p>
<ul>
<li>Never make hateful, discriminatory, or derogatory comments on a player’s gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, mental or physical abilities, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, socioeconomic standing, or otherwise.
This includes micro-aggressions (subtle, indirect discrimination.) </li>
<li>Threats and harassment are inexcusable.
Brushing them off as “just a joke” or “not my intent” will not be accepted.
</li>
<li>Do not behave inappropriately.
Sexual suggestions, bullying, and other forms of misconduct are not accepted.
</li>
<li>Never “punish” someone for not following your line of thinking.
Among Us is all about deception, so getting things wrong is part of the fun! If you are getting frustrated playing the game, take a break.
It’s OK to step away and come back to the game later.
