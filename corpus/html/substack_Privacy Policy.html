<strong>Where will we send your Personal Information?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Substack is established in the US and uses service providers established both in the US and in other countries to process Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
As such, your Personal Information may be shared internationally.</p>
<p>
<strong>Is Personal Information about you secure?</strong>
</p>
<p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.

</p>
<p>Depending on applicable local laws, you may be entitled to ask Substack for a copy of your Personal Information, to correct it, erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of this information to other organizations.
You may also have rights to object to some processing activities or to request restriction of some processing activities.
Where we have asked for your consent to process your Personal Information, you may also have the right to withdraw this consent.
These rights may be limited in some situations or in accordance with applicable law – for example, we cannot delete your Personal Information when we can demonstrate that we have a legal obligation to retain it.
In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent or you delete your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such information is mandatory: if such information is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us.
In all other cases, provision of requested personal data is optional.
Please note we will always inform you where the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or optional.</p>
<p>We hope that we can satisfy any queries you may have about the way we process your Personal Information.
