         Cookies and Similar&nbsp;<br> Technologies <p>We are generally a healthy bunch, but some Fitbit employees like to eat cookies.
In addition, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies on our services, including our websites and mobile applications (the “Services”).
Here we explain these technologies, why we use them, and the choices you have<br>
</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGIES WE USE</p>
<p>Like many services, we use cookies, pixels, local storage, and software development kits (“SDKs”) to remember things about you so that we can provide you with a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are small data files stored on your browser or device.
They may be served by the entity that operates the website you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or by other companies (“third-party cookies”).<ul>
<li>For example, we partner with third-party analytics providers, like Google, which set cookies when you visit our websites.
This helps us understand how you are using our Services so that we can improve them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pixels are small images on a web page or in an email.
Pixels collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies.</li>
<li>Local storage allows data to be stored locally on your browser or device and includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache.</li>
<li>SDKs are blocks of code provided by our partners that may be installed in our mobile applications.
SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>YOUR CHOICES<br>
</p>
<p>You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies, including for advertising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Although most browsers and devices accept cookies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear or decline cookies.
If you disable cookies, however, some of the features of our Services may not function properly.</li>
<li>To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Google’s <u>opt-out browser add-on</u>.</li>
<li>For information on how our advertising partners allow you to opt out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit <u>http://optout.aboutads.info/</u>.</li>

<li>Check your mobile device for settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device.

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note: The Fitbit websites do not respond to Do Not Track signals because we do not track our users over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising.
However, we believe that you should have a choice regarding interest-based ads served by our partners, which is why we outline the options available to you above.</p>
