<strong>About cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that a web server transmits to a web browser and is stored by the browser.
The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
<p>Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies.
A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and remain valid until its expiration date, unless it is deleted by the user, while a session cookie will expire when the web browser is closed at the end of the user session.</p>
<p>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal data that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
Cookies enable a website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don’t have to repetitively enter certain information, perform certain action or configure certain aspects of a website whenever you return to the website or browse from one page to another.
