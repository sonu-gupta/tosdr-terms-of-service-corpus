Behavior on the Site and Liquidated Damages Imposed for Breaches of this Agreement: </p>
<p> a.You will only use Patook to help you find platonic friendships, and not use it to flirt, hit on, or attempt to seduce other members, nor shall you approach users with ulterior motives.
Patook algorithms or moderators will make the final decision as to whether any certain behavior reflects ulterior motives, and any users displaying such behavior may be banned from the Site or blocked without notification.
</p>
<p> b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
You will only use Patook from within one of the supported states or countries.
If you activate Patook in a supported state or country, and then move to an unsupported state or country, you certify that you will deactivate and never use Patook while in that unsupported location.
</p>
<p> c.If you are found to use this app to willingly send inappropriate pictures you agree that you will cause irreparable harm to Patook but that the exact level of the harm may be difficult to ascertain.
As a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur, you may be liable for up to $250 in liquidated damages per violation.
In this paragraph, inappropriate pictures include but are not limited to: pictures showing your or other people's genitalia, pictures of you in underwear, pictures depicting violence or threats to other users, pornographic pictures, and any pictures of an illegal nature, such as those showing the use of illegal substances.
Patook may charge you $250 for each breach of this paragraph of the Terms.
The $250 in damages is a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook will incur, from lost user revenue and damage to Patook's reputation, due to a breach of this paragraph.
You agree to pay the whole amount within 30 days of receiving a notification from Patook LLC.
A breach of this Paragraph shall occur for each inappropriate picture sent to each user.For example, should a user send the same inappropriate messages to three users, at the same time or at different times, that user will be liable for three $250 violations or $750 in total damages.
</p>
<p> d.You understand that pictures or activities that appear to be of an illegal nature may be automatically or manually submitted to law enforcement authorities or other bodies such as the NCMEC, sometimes solely at the discretion of automated algorithms or human moderators.

You understand that Patook does not independently verify user ages.
</p>
<p> e.You will not take or share screenshots of other users' profiles or pictures with the public.

We reserve the right to log any attempts at taking screenshots, and to prevent your device from taking screenshots at any time and for any reason.
</p>
<p> f.We may ban, block, censor, redact or otherwise restrict your account or profile at any time, and for any reason we deem appropriate, without notifying you.
We may partially or entirely hide your account and activity from certain users, or from all users.
We may hide your messages from certain users or all users.
This can be done manually by moderators, automatically by algorithms, or in any way we deem appropriate.
We may choose not to deliver certain messages or all the messages you send.
Those determinations may be made entirely algorithmically by analyzing some or all of your activity on the site, and we will not disclose any information or reason as to why that determination was made, or how those algorithms work.
</p>
<p> g.
Any attempt to reverse engineer the site or flirt detection algorithms will result in an immediate ban and, if done on behalf of a company or competitor, may result in legal action.
This includes but is not limited to: creating multiple accounts to communicate with one another and figure out which messages are delivered, creating an account shortly after deleting another, contacting users to ask them if your messages are going through, or reverse engineering the code or passing special parameters to the app, experimenting with the app to try to find patterns or weaknesses (without our permission).
</p>
<p> h.Any attempt to contact users outside of the app without their explicit permission (such as for example, guessing their Facebook name from their first name and city/pictures, or reading their Snapchat alias off their Patook profiles, and adding them as Snapchat friends without having talked to them within Patook) may result in an immediate ban.
</p>
<p> i.Only one account per user is allowed.
Users caught with more than one account may be permanently banned and have all their accounts disabled.
Users who delete their account, only to create another one shortly thereafter may be permanently banned.
</p>
<p> j.If you are found to be willingly impersonating a different person, either real or invented, you agree that you will cause irreparable harm to Patook but that the exact level of the harm may be difficult to ascertain.
As a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur, you may be liable for up to $250 in liquidated damages per violation.
In this paragraph, impersonating a different person includes but is limited to: using someone else's pictures, lying about your gender, subtantially altering your age, pretending to be a different person that the other user may know.
Patook may charge you $250 for each breach of this paragraph of the Terms.
The $250 in damages is a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook will incur, from lost user revenue and damage to Patook's reputation, due to a breach of this paragraph.
You agree to pay the whole amount within 30 days of receiving a notification from Patook LLC.
A breach of this Paragraph shall occur for each user you contact under the fake assumed identity.For example, should a 35-year male user posing as a 22 year old woman contact three women using that fake identity, that user will be liable for three $250 violations or $750 in total damages.

</u> &nbsp;You will not advertise or solicit any user to buy or sell any products or services through the Site.
You may not transmit any chain letters, junk or spam e-mail to other users.
Furthermore, you will not use any information obtained from the Site in order to contact, advertise to, solicit, or sell to any user without their prior explicit consent.
This prohibition includes marketing services, products or businesses, recruiting users for either paid or unpaid jobs (both legitimate and illegitimate jobs), recruiting for pyramid schemes, or recruiting for multi-level marketing companies.
If you breach the terms of this subsection, or send or post unsolicited bulk email, "spam" or other unsolicited communications of any kind through the Services, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to Patook, but that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to ascertain.
As a reasonable estimation of such harm, you agree to pay Patook $100 for each such unsolicited communication you send through the Services.
<u> Banned user.
</u> If you are banned from Patook, for whatever reason, you will make no attempt to ever register an account again without Patook's written express permission.
As a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur, you may be liable for up to $250 in liquidated damages per new account created.
As a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur from banned users creating unauthorized new accounts, you agree to pay Patook the sum of $250 if you create a new account after having been banned, and an extra $250 for each subsequent account you create after being banned.
If you were talking to a user that was banned, Patook will have no responsibility to inform you that the user was banned and what the reason was, even if it was a terms of service violation.
In general, Patook does not notify any users when a ban occurs.
<u> Pyramid Schemes and MLM schemes.
</u> If you are found to be attempting to recruit users for a pyramid, marketing or other Multi-Layer Marketing ("MLM") scheme, you agree to pay Patook the sum of $250 for each user that you contacted as a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur due to you attempting to recruit another user for a pyramid marketing or other MLM scheme, even if that specific user did not reply or you did not begin recruiting them.
In this section, recruiting also includes: a- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Sending overview or informational videos to users regarding the MLM companies.
b- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Inviting users to informational seminars.
c- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.

You understand that Patook will not warn you before taking such actions.
You understand that Patook may report you to the law enforcement authorities of your country and provide all the communications you had on the site, including your messages and physical location.
You agree that Patook may take additional precautions against such behavior, including, but not limited to, publishing your information/photo/contact info on a public list of known MLM schemers, or contacting all the users you were in touch with and asking them to report you.
In the event that you contest that a specific scheme is an MLM, Patook will make the final determination as to whether that is the case.
In general, any kind of money-making scheme will fall under this category.
You also agree to report any scheme that falls under this category, and that Patook will in no way be liable if you are a victim of MLM or pyramid schemes.

<u> Additional Site and app specific terms and conditions: </u>
<u> Credits: </u> the site allows for the use of credits to unlock additional features or improve existing ones.
Credits are non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for money or transferred once acquired.
In the event that a <u>user</u> deletes his or her account, or is deleted by moderators of the Site for any reason, all the credits associated with their account will be deleted.
<u> Coupons: </u> the site allows the use of coupons to receive additional credits.
Coupons can expire at any time and often have a maximum number of uses.
In addition, coupons may be revoked, and cannot be exchanged for money.
They are also non-transferrable and have no cash value.
<u> Verified Profiles: </u> some user profiles on the site have a verified profile tag next to them.
This means that a picture of that user holding a "Patook" sign was sent to a moderator and a minimal verification was done.
It doesn't mean that the site or the Company made any additional verification, nor is it a guarantee that the person's profile is genuine.
For example, users may provide verification and then change their picture to something else.
Or they may forge verification pictures.
Therefore, there is absolutely no guarantee that the person is who they claim they are, or that they are of the same age they claim to be (for example, they could be below the age of 18).

In the case of an issue with billing, or accidental orders, you may contact the app store owner (typically Google or Apple) within a few hours of purchase to request a refund (varies based on their terms of service).
The refund would then be at their discretion.
If you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not Patook.
If you wish to request a refund, please visit&nbsp.
https://getsupport.apple.com .
For Google, you may do so through Google Play.
Paid premium upgrades have an expiration period specified in the upgrade page.
After that time has elapsed, the user's account will revert to a standard, non-premium account and the premium features will be disabled.

<u> In App Purchases.&nbsp.
</u>
<u>
</u> From time to time, Patook may offer products and services for purchase ("in app purchases") through iTunes,&nbsp;Google Play or other application platforms authorized by Patook (each, a "Software Store").
If you choose to make an in-app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your Software Store ("your IAP Account"), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in-app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that apply to your IAP Account.
Some Software Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live.
If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in-app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you cancel.
After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing.
If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Patook application from your device.
Deleting your account on Patook or deleting the Patook application from your device does not cancel your subscription.
Patook will retain all funds charged to your IAP Account until you cancel your subscription through your IAP Account.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PATOOK IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
