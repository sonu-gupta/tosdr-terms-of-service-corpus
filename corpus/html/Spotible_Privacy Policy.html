         <br> LAST UPDATED - JANUARY 29, 2021 Privacy Policy <p>Spotible is committed to the right of Internet consumer privacy.
Spotible technology services do not require the collection of any personal data from users.
However, in order to provide the most enhanced end-user experience such as advertisement frequency control, Spotible utilizes Local Storage Objects (LSOs).
An LSO provides a unique computer identifier that by no means intrudes on the user’s anonymity to Spotible, nor is required for the operation and/or serving of Spotible advertisements.
The acceptance and removal of LSOs is controllable from standard web browsers.</p> COLLECTION OF INTERNET CONSUMER DATA <p>Spotible collects and may share aggregated non-personally identifiable information-- such as anonymous advertisement interaction and reporting data related to user device, page(s) or application(s) visited, data and time of advertisement viewed and level of engagement or viewership of advertisement campaigns-- with media publishers and advertisers interested in ad viewership patterns and performance benchmarks of Spotible advertisement campaigns.</p>
<p>In some cases, Spotible may store personally identifiable information users have explicitly submitted in a Spotible advertisement campaign, such as entering your zip code to receive a promotion from an advertiser promoting a product or service.
Any personal information supplied by a user and collected in a Spotible advertisement campaign is solely and strictly provided to the media publisher or advertiser or their respective authorized service provider and is not retained or used by Spotible in any way for any other purpose.
The third party’s collection and use of user submitted personal information is protected under the respective party’s privacy policy and Spotible is not responsible for that third party’s privacy or information practices.</p> USE OF INTERNET CONSUMER DATA <p>Spotible primary use of collected consumer data information is for the purpose of providing the best suited advertisement campaigns fitting device capabilities, user engagement and reducing the repetition of advertisements through reach and frequency capping.</p> ACCORDANCE OF INTERNET CONSUMER DATA <p>Spotible data collection and usage upholds full compliance to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, 2013 Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Code of Conduct for Online Behavioral Advertising and 2013 NAI Mobile Application Code, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA”), EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as updated periodically.</p>
