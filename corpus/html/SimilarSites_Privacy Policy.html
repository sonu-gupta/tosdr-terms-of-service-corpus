<b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b>
</p>
<p>The first type of information we collect is non-identifiable aggregated information which is made available via your use of the Extension and Service (“<b>Non-Personal Information</b>“).
We are not aware of and cannot determine the identity of the users from whom the Non-Personal Information is collected.

<ul>

and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search engine results page data (keyword, order/index of results, links of results, title, description, and ads displayed).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second type of information we may collect when you install the Extension or otherwise use the Service is identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort be used to identify an individual (“<b>Personal Information</b>“), which includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Personal Information voluntarily provided by you if and when you contact us, which may include your name and email address, provided that such information will be used solely to communicate with and support you, and will not be shared with any third parties (“<b>Communication Data</b>”);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IP address, which is trimmed and hashed (irreversibly encrypted) on a daily basis, and thus is not and cannot be traced back to an individual or used in any way to identify an individual.
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SimilarWeb unique identification number, which is a random number we generate to keep track of the data sets we collect and if required, enable us to execute your data rights requests as further detailed below.
Although the unique ID does not reveal the identity of a user and is not generated based on any user personal information, it may be considered Personal Information in some jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>We make sure that the Extension Usage Data is cleaned and scrubbed on your device prior to being sent to our servers, for the purpose of removing and filtering any information that could be used to identify you and transferring solely Non-Personal Information to our servers.

<b>IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</b>
</p>
<p>In this section, we provide information for California residents, as required under California privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“<b>CCPA</b>”), which requires that we provide California residents certain specific information about how we handle their personal information, whether collected online or offline.
Under the CCPA, “<i>
<b>personal information</b>
</i>” is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California resident or household.
It does not include publicly available data as defined by the CCPA.
This section does not address or apply to our handling of publicly available information made lawfully available by state or federal governments or other personal information that is subject to an exemption under Section 1798.145(c) – (f) of the CCPA.</p>
<p>Except for the Right to Opt-out and the Right of Non-Discrimination, this section does not apply to California residents with whom we transact or communicate solely in the context of providing or receiving a product or service to or from a company that employs such residents or engages such residents as contractors.</p>

Our collection, use and disclosure of personal information about a California resident will vary depending upon the circumstances and nature of our interactions or relationship with such resident.</p>
