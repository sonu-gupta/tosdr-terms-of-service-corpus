</p>

<i>
</i> The Scope of This Policy <p> This policy applies to all Lyft users, including Riders and Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all Lyft platforms and services, including our apps, websites, features, and other services (collectively, the “Lyft Platform”).
Please remember that your use of the Lyft Platform is also subject to our Terms of Service.
</p> The Information We Collect <p> When you use the Lyft Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and information about your device.
We also collect information about you from other sources like third party services, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you.
Here are the types of information we collect about you: </p> A.
Information You Provide to Us <p>
<strong>Account Registration.</strong> When you create an account with Lyft, we collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, and payment information.
You may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider profile, like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as your preferred pronouns).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Driver Information.</strong> If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social security number), driver’s license information, vehicle information, and car insurance information.
We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing numbers, and tax information.
Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for additional business license or permit information.
We may need additional information from you at some point after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like a photo).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ratings and Feedback.</strong> When you rate and provide feedback about Riders or Drivers, we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communications.</strong> When you contact us or we contact you, we collect any information that you provide, including the contents of the messages or attachments you send us.
</p> B.
Information We Collect When You Use the Lyft Platform <p>
<strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup.
The Lyft Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending on your Lyft app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver: </p>
<ul>
<li> Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the Lyft app, including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends.
Lyft also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.
</li>
<li> Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in the background when it is in driver mode.
We also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your use of the Lyft Platform, including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code.
We also collect information about your interactions with the Lyft Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access the Lyft Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens.
If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either party’s actual phone number with the other.
But while we use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages.
For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the Lyft Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device permissions to grant Lyft access to your contact lists and direct Lyft to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to Lyft.
If you do this, we will access and store the names and contact information of the people in your address book.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies, Analytics, and Third Party Technologies.</strong> We collect information through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, data analytics tools like Google Analytics, SDKs, and other third party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Lyft Platform and interact with Lyft advertisements, to make your Lyft experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences.
Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device.
they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser.
We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use the Lyft Platform.
You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie settings.

To make the Lyft Platform work, we may need to share your personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers.
This section explains when and why we share your information.
</p> A.
Sharing Between Lyft Users <p>
<strong>Riders and Drivers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Rider information shared with Driver:</em> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns).
Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Lyft app.
Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver.
(We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.) </p>
<p>
<em>Driver information shared with Rider:</em> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver’s Lyft profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).
</p>
<p> Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users.
If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your consent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a Lyft Shared ride, we share each Rider’s name and profile picture to ensure safety.
Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others.
If you take one of those rides using your Lyft Business Profile account, a code or coupon, a corporate credit card linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests a ride for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party, including the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral.
If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Lyft Platform with that user.
For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information.
</p> B.
Sharing With Third-Party Service Providers for Business Purposes <p> Depending on whether you’re a Rider or a Driver, Lyft may share the following categories of your personal information for a business purpose (as we have done for the preceding 12 months) to provide you with a variety of the Lyft Platform’s features and services: </p>

</li>
<li> Financial information, such as bank routing numbers, tax information, and any other payment information you provide us.
</li>
<li> Commercial information, such as ride information, Driver/Rider statistics and feedback, and Driver/Rider transaction history.
</li>
<li> Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as your IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, carrier and/or manufacturer, device identifiers, and mobile advertising identifiers.
and </li>
<li> Location data.
</li>
</ul>
<p> We disclose those categories of personal information to service providers to fulfill the following business purposes: </p>
<ul>
<li> Maintaining and servicing your Lyft account.
</li>
<li> Processing or fulfilling rides.
</li>
<li> Providing you customer service.
</li>

</li>
<li> Processing Driver applications and payments.
</li>
<li> Verifying the identity of users.
</li>
<li> Detecting and preventing fraud.
</li>

</li>
<li> Providing Driver loyalty and promotional programs.
</li>
<li> Providing marketing and advertising services to Lyft.
</li>
<li> Providing financing.
</li>
<li> Providing requested emergency services.

<ul>
<li> Comply with any applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation, civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation or legal process, or enforceable governmental request.

</p> E.
Upon Your Further Direction <p> With your permission or upon your direction, we may disclose your personal information to interact with a third party or for other purposes.
</p> How We Store and Protect Your Information <p> We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Lyft Platform.
This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account.

If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the “Deleting Your Account” section below.
</p>
<p> We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information.
But no security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information, including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.
</p> Your Rights And Choices Regarding Your Data <p> As explained more below and on our privacy homepage, Lyft provides ways for you to access and delete your personal information as well as exercise other data rights that give you certain control over your personal information.
