         Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) Policies <p>
</p> &nbsp.
<p>Each country code TLD (ccTLD) is operated by an independent Registry that sets policies to govern the registration and use of that particular ccTLD.
Consequently, each ccTLD is governed by a unique set of policies.</p>
<p>Please see Exhibit A of our Registration Agreement for the full terms and conditions to which Registrants are bound.
The Registrant is responsible for monitoring the Registryâ€™s site on a regular basis.
If you do not wish to be bound by a revision or modification to any Registry policy, your sole remedy is to cancel your domain name registration.
The cancellation process differs between Registries.
You may contact your Domain Provider [link to FYDP page] or refer to the appropriate Registry page to determine the cancellation procedure for your ccTLD name.</p>
