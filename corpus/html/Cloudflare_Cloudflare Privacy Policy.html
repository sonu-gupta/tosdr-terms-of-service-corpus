<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 27, 2020.</p>
<p>
<em>We have updated our March 31, 2020 privacy policy to reflect that we no longer rely on the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shields as a basis under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the transfer of personal data from the EU, UK, and Switzerland to the United States.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the personal information that Cloudflare, Inc.
(“Cloudflare”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we use that personal information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such personal information.</em>
</p> CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE
<p>Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with our Customers, users, and the Internet community globally.
To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.</p>
<p>We keep your personal information personal and private.
We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.
We will not share or otherwise disclose your personal information except as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy without first providing you with notice and the opportunity to consent.
<br>
<br>
</p>
1.
POLICY APPLICATION
<p>This Policy applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of the personal information of the following categories of data subjects:</p>
<ul>

<strong>Attendees:</strong> Those who visit our offices or provide their information to Cloudflare or Cloudflare representatives when they attend or register to attend Cloudflare-sponsored events or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, as well as those who participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Website Visitors:</strong> Those who visit our Websites, including those who may opt to provide an email address or other contact information to receive communications from Cloudflare, fill out a survey, or provide feedback.
For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites” refer collectively to www.cloudflare.com as well as any other websites Cloudflare operates for its own behalf and that link to this Policy.
For clarity, “Websites” does not include any sites owned or operated by our Customers, including where we serve as Registrar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Customers:</strong> Individuals or entities who enter into a subscription agreement with Cloudflare (or its authorized partner) and to whom Cloudflare provides Services pursuant to such agreement.
For purposes of this Policy, “Services” shall refer to all of the cloud-based solutions offered, marketed, or sold by Cloudflare or its authorized partners that are designed to increase the performance, security, and availability of Internet properties, applications, devices, and networks, along with any software, software development kits, and application programming interfaces ("APIs") made available in connection with the foregoing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Administrators:</strong> Those with login credentials for a Cloudflare account and/or those who administer any of the Services for a Customer.
In some cases, an Administrator and Customer may be the same individual.
In other cases, an Administrator may be an agent acting on behalf of a Customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Public DNS Resolver Users:</strong> Those who use Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 public recursive Domain Name System (“DNS”) resolver service, including 1.1.1.1 for Families ("1.1.1.1 resolver").
Learn more about the 1.1.1.1 resolver here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>End Users:</strong> Those who (i) access or use our Customers’ domains, networks, websites, application programming interfaces, and applications, or (ii) are authorized Cloudflare for Teams users, such as our Customers’ employees, agents, or contractors.</p>

<strong>Registrants:</strong> Users of Cloudflare’s domain registrar services.
Cloudflare is an ICANN-accredited registrar and complies with the 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement (“RAA”).</p>

See the 1.1.1.1 Application Privacy Policy for more information about the data collection and use practices for Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Application and the associated 1.1.1.1 Application Services.
</p>
<p>This Policy also does not apply to our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, and networks, which may have their own terms and privacy policies.
Our Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to the collection of personal information, in connection with the use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.</p>
<p>Cloudflare’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen.
Cloudflare does not knowingly collect personal information from any person under the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>When Cloudflare is a reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS records for websites using our Services.

<p>If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the UK or Switzerland, please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information collected and the specific context in which we collect it.
We normally will collect personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g.
to deliver the Cloudflare Services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our legitimate interests.
Please note that in most cases, if you do not provide the requested information, Cloudflare will not be able to provide the requested service to you.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time.
Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.

We may also be required to share this public data with ICANN, the relevant registry operators and other such providers with whom we contract in order to provide our domain name services, and additionally upon the legitimate request of third parties.
Registrant data may include the domain name, registrant name and other contact information, and domain name server information.

INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS
<p>Cloudflare is a U.S.-based, global company.
We primarily store your information in the United States and the European Economic Area.
To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>
<p>Whenever Cloudflare shares personal information originating in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland with a Cloudflare entity outside the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses (adjusted to address transfers from the UK).</p>
<p>If you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or otherwise providing information to us, we may transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information.
We describe our additional safeguards here.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the appropriate safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.</p>
<p>While Cloudflare no longer relies on the EU-U.S.
and the Swiss -U.S.
Privacy Shield as a lawful basis for international transfers of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S., Cloudflare remains certified under both the EU-U.S.
and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks respectively as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland to the United States, respectively (“Privacy Shields”).
We commit to periodically review and verify the accuracy of our policies and our compliance with the Privacy Shields.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
For more information on the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield, please visit the U.S.
Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at: https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome.</p>
<p>If you believe that we maintain copies of your personal data within the scope of the Privacy Shields, you may direct any inquiries to SAR@cloudflare.com or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer.
We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.
</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
If neither we nor our dispute resolution provider are able to resolve your complaint, as a last resort you may engage in binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.</p>
<p>Our commitments under the Privacy Shields are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
We may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Under such circumstances, we may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of disclosure.

DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES
<p>For any subject access request ("SAR"), we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist.
Where a SAR may implicate the personal data of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights.
We will comply with SARs to the extent required by applicable law or the US-Swiss or US-EU Privacy Shield.
In the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
<p>
<strong>Attendees, Website Visitors, Customers, Administrators, and Registrants.</strong> You have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal information.
You may email us at SAR@cloudflare.com with any such subject access requests (“SAR”), and we will respond within thirty (30) days.
Customers and Administrators also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at cloudflare.com.</p>
<p>
<strong>Public DNS Resolver Users.</strong> We do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that would be subject to the data subject rights described above.</p>
<p>
<strong>End Users.</strong> Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users.
Even where “Cloudflare” may be indicated as the authoritative name server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain, we have no control over a domain’s content.
Accordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for subject access requests.
If an End User requests that we access, correct, update, or delete their information, or no longer wishes to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Services, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly.
Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website users.</p>
