</i> I<em>A</em> Comments Policy <p>Comments are moderated and may be removed if they:</p>
<ol>
<li>are untrue, contain untruths, or contain allegedly factual&nbsp;claims that are unsourced and/or unreferenced;</li>
<li>are off-topic, which includes any comment which reflects on moderation;</li>
<li>are inflammatory, or contain&nbsp;threats or personal attacks;</li>
<li>contain explicit, profane&nbsp;or violent language;</li>
<li>are prima facie defamatory, or contain potentially prejudicial references to ongoing legal cases;</li>
<li>contain personal information;</li>
<li>contain links to unrelated, non-credible, violent, hatemongering and/or explicit websites;</li>
<li>merely contain a link, or links, without any accompanying explanatory text;</li>
<li>are longer than the article itself.
or</li>
<li>are spam â€” such as where one person or a small group&nbsp;dominates the comments so as to&nbsp;drown out other voices, or attempts to close down debate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comments will not be edited to remove any of the above.</p>
<p>Any comments that are seen to break any of these rules may be flagged by the reader, which will send the comment back to moderation.</p>
<p>Moderation is done in as fair a way as possible, though by definition it is subjective and at the discretion of the moderators and the publication.</p>
<p>
<em>No correspondence on moderation will be entered into.</em>
