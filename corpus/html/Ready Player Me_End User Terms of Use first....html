CREATING AND MAKING THE AVATAR AVAILABLE
</p>
<p>5.1.
In order to create an Avatar, you must:
</p>
<p>a) choose the gender of the Avatar (the algorithms for the creation of Avatars
</p>
<p>for sexes vary slightly).
</p>
<p>b) either:
</p>
<p>i.
take a photo of your face (selfie) using the forward facing camera of your
</p>
<p>device (for that we request access to your device’s camera) with a neutral
</p>
<p>facial expression and good lighting or choose an existing photo that meets
</p>
<p>the same requirements.
Also, make sure that your hair (or anything else)
</p>
<p>does not cover your face.
Remove you glasses if you are wearing them.
</p>
<p>This photo is used as a basis for the Avatar.
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>ii.
continue without a photo in which case a standard Avatar is taken as the
</p>
<p>basis.
</p>
<p>c) customise the Avatar (e.g.
select hair style, colour, accessories, etc.).
</p>
<p>5.2.
When customizing the Avatar we do not expect you to enter correct data about your
</p>
<p>appearance because the Avatar is not meant to be an exact copy of you.
We hope
</p>
<p>that you are creative and let your imagination run its course.
</p>
<p>5.3.
Once the customization is finished by you, the Avatar data file is created on the
</p>
<p>Platform.
</p>
<p>5.4.
Where you are using the Platform via the Partner’s Application, you hereby give us
</p>
<p>authorisation to make the Avatar available to the respective Partner so it can be
</p>
<p>used in the Partner’s Application.
</p>
<p>5.5.
You also have a possibility to copy the link for using the Avatar in other
</p>
<p>environments and make the Avatar available therein.
The respective instructions
</p>
<p>are given at the Platform and/or in those other environments.
</p>
<p>5.6.
We keep the right to retain the created Avatar in our server.
However, we do not
</p>
<p>have the obligation to retain it.
If you wish, you can view and customize your Avatar
</p>
<p>later by visiting the Platform as long as you have not deleted the cookies sent by
</p>
<p>the Platform to your device from creating the Avatar.
Once you delete these cookies,
</p>
<p>you are not able to access your Avatar from the Platform.
</p>
<p>6.
USING THE AVATAR
</p>
<p>6.1.
Once the Avatar has been created you can use the Avatar in any environment where
</p>
<p>it is made available, including in the Partner’s Application, to the extent that:
</p>
<p>a) the Avatar is not used inappropriately or for any immoral, illegal, abusive or
</p>
<p>harmful purpose at the sole discretion of Wolf3D – for example, it is prohibited
</p>
<p>to use the Avatar for political reasons and/or in the adult entertainment
</p>
<p>industry.
</p>
<p>b) the reputation of Wolf3D nor the respective Partner’s is in any way harmed or
</p>
<p>decreased.
and
</p>Seite 3 von 7<p>3
</p>
<p>c) other terms and conditions of these Terms have been fully complied with.
</p>
<p>6.2.
You hereby agree that it is at our sole discretion to decide whether any use of the
</p>
<p>Avatar complies with these Terms or not and in the latter case it is at our sole
</p>
<p>discretion to request you or the respective Partner to stop the usage of the Avatar.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving such request, you shall stop using the Avatar immediately.
</p>

</p>
<p>your e-mail address) to inform you of updates and other important information.
</p>
<p>7.2.
You can unsubscribe from such e-mails at any time.
</p>
<p>8.
PAID FEATURES AND NO FEE
</p>
<p>8.1.
We may in the future, at our sole discretion, introduce paid Avatar features or
</p>
<p>customization assets, such as, but not limited to virtual clothing, accessories and
</p>
<p>makeup for the use of which you must pay a fee for us (hereinafter: Paid
</p>
<p>Features).
</p>
<p>8.2.
The core Services, such as creation of Avatar are free of any fee payable by you to

<p>right to do so in the future as we are entitled to amend the Terms (see clause 10
