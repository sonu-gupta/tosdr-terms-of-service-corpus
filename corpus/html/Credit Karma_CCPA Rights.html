         Your Rights Under the California Consumer Protection Act <p>
<strong>Special notice for California residents:</strong>
</p>
<p>Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allows California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, to request that a business that collects consumers’ personal information to give consumers access, in a portable and (if technically feasible) readily usable form, to the specific pieces and categories of personal information that the business has collected about the consumer, the categories of sources for that information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared.
California residents also have the right to submit a request for deletion of information under certain circumstances.
Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your rights, we won’t charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your information.</p>
<p>
<i>We do not sell your personal information.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>We disclose personal information for business purposes.
From businesses that disclose personal information for a business purpose, you have the right to request :</i>
</p>
<p>(1) The categories of personal information that the business collected about you.
and</p>
<p>(2) The categories of personal information that the business disclosed about you for a business purpose.</p>
<p>
<i>The right to request the business to delete the personal information it has collected from you,</i>&nbsp;subject to certain legal exceptions, for example, when the personal information is necessary to complete a transaction for which we collected it or to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
<p>
<i>The right to be protected from discrimination for exercising your CCPA rights.</i>&nbsp;Businesses are prohibited from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the statute, including by: (A) denying you goods or services.
(B) charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.
(C) providing you with a different level or quality of goods or services.
or (D) suggesting that you will receive a different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or services.
Nothing prohibits a business from charging a different price or providing a different level or quality of service if the difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer’s data.</p>
