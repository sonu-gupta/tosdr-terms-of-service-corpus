<i>
At Sam’s Club, our member is number one.
That’s why everything we do is focused on providing excellent service and delivering low prices.
</i>
<p>
</p>
<p>The information you share with Sam’s Club allows us to provide the products and services you want and need while giving you the very best shopping experience.
For example, when you shop on Samsclub.com we use what we know about your shopping habits to let you easily reorder products and show you other products that may interest you.</p>
<p>Our founder, Sam Walton, reminded us that “a promise we make is a promise we keep,” and it’s our promise to members that we respect the trust you place in us and the privacy of the information you share with us.
Part of providing superior member service includes making sure that we’re building a relationship of trust with members.
Our way of doing that is to let you know in a clear, prominent, and easily accessible way just how we collect, use, share, and – above all – protect your personal information.</p>
<p> Our Policy outlines:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>How and why we collect your personal information.</li>
<li>How your personal information is used and protected.</li>
<li>When and with whom we share your personal information.</li>
<li>What choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your personal information.</li>
</ul> What Does This Privacy Policy Include? <p>
</p>
<p>Our Policy covers how and why we collect, use, share and protect your personal information:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Within Sam’s Club in the United States and Puerto Rico, and</li>
<li>On our websites and mobile services where this Policy is posted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Policy focuses on personal information – information that identifies you or reasonably can be linked to information that identifies you.</p>
<p>For example, when you purchase a membership or place an order online, to fulfill your order we collect personal information, such as name, address, phone number, and credit or debit card information.</p>
<p>Some laws define “personal information” differently, and we use those definitions when they are applicable.
Rest assured, though, that no matter where you live, we treat your personal information with respect, and we collect, use, and share it only as described in this Policy.</p>
<p>We have specific privacy notices that explain the information practices that apply to our specialized operations.
See “<i>What Privacy Protections Apply to Specific Types of Personal Information</i>?” section for more information.
<br>

</p>
<p>
<b>Deidentified &amp.
Aggregated Personal Information</b>
<br>Sam’s Club continually strives to make member shopping experiences more relevant and with less friction and may offer related services and insights to its suppliers and others.
As a result, Sam’s Club may share with others insights that combine information from many members in ways that do not directly identify you.
For example, Sam’s Club may combine your shopping history with that of other members to deliver generalized insights to Sam’s Club’s suppliers.
These insights do not identify individual members.
This information helps Sam’s Club suppliers provide products and services relevant to Sam’s Club members.
Sam’s Club may receive payment for these insights.</p>
<p>To deliver information about products and services that may be of interest to you, we may share information with other companies, such as publishers, advertisers and measurement analytics providers.
For example, we may share device-related data (such as device identifier, type of device, IP address, cookies and other information associated with your browsing and app usage) and individual preferences and characteristics (such as insights and inferences related to shopping patterns and behaviors).
This information does not identify you directly, but is necessary to personalize the advertisements you receive.
Sam’s Club does not receive payment for this information.</p>
<p>We also allow companies that show advertisements on our webpages or our apps to collect information from your browsers or devices via the use of cookies or other technologies.
Like many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select partners.
However, these parties are not authorized to access information from our cookies.
For more information about your choices related to advertising activities see <i>“What are Your Choices?” </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>With Specific Notice or Your Consent</b>

<p>You have choices about the various ways we collect, use, and share your personal information.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We may send you marketing communications.
You can tell us your marketing preferences in different ways, including by logging on to your SamsClub.com account and clicking "edit" under Email preferences in the Member profile.</li>
<li>We also personalize your experience on our sites and mobile services by showing you advertisements from Sam’s Club or our advertising partners that are tailored to your interests.
Learn more about interest-based advertising.</li>
<li>Some of our mobile services use your device’s location information.
You can adjust the settings of your mobile device at any time to control whether your device communicates this location information.
We may also offer additional controls on our use of your mobile location information.</li>
</ul>
<p> We want to offer you choices about the different ways we collect, use, or share your personal information.
These choices are described below.</p>
<p>
<b>Marketing Preferences</b>
<br>When we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following standards:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We use an opt-in standard for automated phone and text messages, and for sharing personal information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for their use in direct marketing of their products, such as sending you promotions for their products.
Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent.</li>
<li>We use an opt-out standard for phone, email, app notifications, and postal mail.
Opt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, these standards may not apply to Sam’s Club-branded credit card offerings because these are provided through associated financial institutions.
However, you can choose to stop receiving certain prescreened offers of credit that originate from participating nationwide credit reporting agencies, including our prescreened offers, by calling the official Consumer Credit Reporting Industry organization at 1-888-567-8688 or by going to www.optoutprescreen.com.</p>
<p> As a Sam’s Club member, you may update your marketing preferences any of the following ways:<br>

It may take up to ten days to process your requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests related to telephone calls, text messages, app notification and sharing information with your consent.
Please note that postal mailings are often prepared many weeks in advance, and you may continue to receive mail for six to ten weeks.</p>
<p>Since we do not accept opt-out requests from third parties (except as described in the <i>“What are Your California Privacy Rights?” </i>section), such as catalog opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to us through one of the mechanisms mentioned above.</p>
<p>Please know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes.
