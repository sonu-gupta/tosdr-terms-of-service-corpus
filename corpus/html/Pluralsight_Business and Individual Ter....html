PLURALSIGHT SUBSCRIPTION PLANS AND PAYMENT <p>(a) <u>Subscription Plan and Subscription Management</u>
</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<u>Plan Scope and Term.</u> The Pluralsight business plan you purchase, register for, order, or renew includes the features set forth on http://www.pluralsight.com/plans or https://www.pluralsight.com/pricing/flow (each, a “<b>Plan</b>”) or, in the Company Partnership Plan (see below).
Pluralsight grants you access to the Platform for the term length set forth at the time of purchase, either during online checkout or as specified on a Sales Order (the “<b>Initial Term</b>”) in strict accordance with these Terms.
Any renewal of the Initial Term (or a Renewal Term), whether such renewal occurs by way of your automatic renewal, online checkout, a renewal Sales Order, or otherwise, shall be deemed a “<b>Renewal Term</b>”, and together with the Initial Term, the “<b>Term</b>”, as applicable.</p>
<p>(i).&nbsp;<u>Registration of Individual Users.</u> Depending on your Plan, you may designate one or more of your employees to act as plan manager(s) (each, a “<b>Plan Manager</b>”).
Any Plan Manager you authorize will have the ability to view user data and content, purchase additional subscriptions, invite users to utilize the features included in your Plan, including assigning and authorizing users via the Platform’s Plan administrative functionalities.
By purchasing a Plan, a specific number of individuals may register as Pluralsight users and receive access to the Platform.
Each user must be designated and assigned by the business purchasing the Plan or by such business’s designated Plan Manager, after which each user will be invited to register for a Pluralsight account and receive access to the Platform.
Access to the Platform, including individual subscriptions, is to be used for the internal purposes of the business purchasing the Plan and may not be shared.
If your Plan requires it, or if you desire, we can assign and authorize users to specific features included in your Plan after your purchase so long as you provide us with the first name, last name, and email address of the individuals that will be entitled to access the Platform.
Contact your designated Pluralsight Sales Representative or&nbsp;sales@pluralsight.com for&nbsp;more details.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;<u>Changing the Number of Users</u>.&nbsp;As a Plan holder, you or your Plan Manager may add additional users during the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, as applicable.
Access to the Platform is conditioned upon timely payment for each user added, which will be prorated for the number of days remaining in your then-current Term and paid by your Payment Method on file (or invoiced).
The number of individual users permitted in your Plan may not be reduced during the Term, nor will refunds be given for unused or unassigned licenses.</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;<u>Transfer of Access Not Permitted</u>.&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that the user access is specific to the individuals you designate.
Except as set forth in your Sales Order, access granted under these Terms are <i>not transferable</i> to any other individual for any reason, and you will take all commercially reasonable steps to prevent your users from granting access to the Platform to any other individuals, both in and outside of your organization.</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp;<u>Automatic Renewal</u>.&nbsp;Unless you terminate your Plan in accordance with 12(b) below, or are purchasing through a reseller, or as otherwise set forth in your Sales Order, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT AT THE END OF EACH APPLICABLE TERM WE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR PLAN (INCLUDING ALL FEATURES ON YOUR PLAN AT THAT TIME) FOR A PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS AND PROCESS YOUR PAYMENT METHOD OR INVOICE FOR PAYMENT FOR THE RENEWAL TERM UP TO THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO YOUR RENEWAL DATE AT THE THEN-APPLICABLE PRICE FOR YOUR PLAN.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;<u>Payment</u>.&nbsp;Access to the Platform is expressly conditioned on timely payment of the then-applicable fee(s) in advance for your Plan in the amount set forth during online checkout or in a Sales Order, unless you are accessing the Platform via a free pilot or other no-fee arrangement.
We reserve the right to increase or decrease any fee at any time.
however, to the extent you have paid your fee(s) in advance, the increase or decrease will not become effective for your Plan or service until the end of your current Term.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;<u>Payment Method</u>.
By registering for, subscribing to, or purchasing a Plan and providing billing information, you grant us and our authorized third-party payment processor(s) the right to process payment using the debit card, credit card, bank information, third-party payment provider, or reseller you provide, authorize, or maintain on your account (individually, and collectively,&nbsp;“<b>Payment Method</b>”).</p>
<p>(ii).&nbsp;<u>Payment by Invoice</u>.&nbsp;If you choose to be invoiced during online checkout (or choose to have a third-party payment provider or reseller be invoiced on your behalf) rather than using your own Payment Method, you will be billed upon execution of a Sales Order, irrespective of the Plan start date, or, for online checkout, as of or around the Plan start date set forth during checkout.
You hereby agree that payment is due as of the date of any Pluralsight invoice, payable within thirty (30) days of said date.</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;<u>Editing Your Payment Method</u>.&nbsp;IIf using online checkout, you may edit your payment method information by visiting our website and clicking on the “Account” link, available at the top of the pages of the Pluralsight website.
If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your payment method information or have not provided proper notice of cancellation of your account (see Cancellation Policy in Section 12(b) below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the payment method, as it may be updated.
This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.
We may update your payment method with information provided by the applicable payment service provider, and you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable fee to the updated payment method.
Check with your payment method service provider for more details.</p>
<p>(1) When you provide or add any form of payment method to your account, your bank may reserve the funds necessary or place a small authorization hold until the transaction processes or the authorization hold expires, but this is not the actual charge.
The authorization will be removed from your account according to the policies of your bank.
and as such, to remove an authorization, please contact your bank to clarify how long they hold authorizations for online orders.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used, and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices because of exchange rates and other Pluralsight-provided geographic-specific pricing.
We do not support all payment methods, currencies, or locations for payment.</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp;<u>Collection Methods</u>.&nbsp;If your payment method fails, or if your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms—this may include charging other payment methods on file with us or retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, the fees and cost of which you hereby agree to pay.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your obligation to pay fees continues through the end of your applicable Term and regardless of whether you cancel your Plan during such Term.
Late payments will bear an additional 1.5% interest monthly, plus taxes if applicable, which additional interest will be compounded daily.</p>
<p>(v)&nbsp;<u>Suspension Because of Nonpayment</u>.&nbsp;If payment is not received within the required time period, or if we are unable to renew your Plan based on inaccurate or outdated payment information, we may suspend your access to the Platform (including all of your users’ access) until payment is received.
In the event we suspend your Plan because of nonpayment and reinstate access to the Platform after you have made payment, no additional time will be added to the then-applicable Term.</p>
<p>(vi)&nbsp;<u>Chargebacks</u>.&nbsp;If you file a chargeback disputing charges made to Payment Method by Pluralsight and the chargeback is granted, your account will be deactivated.</p>
<p>(vii)&nbsp;<u>Excess Use</u>.&nbsp;If you use the Platform or services in violation of the scope granted hereunder, including but not limited to unauthorized rotation of user subscriptions within your Plan, or adding active users in excess of those outlined in your Sales Order (“Excess Use”), Pluralsight may, in its sole discretion, invoice you for the Excess Use, at the rates set forth in the applicable Sales Order or, in the absence thereof, our current list price for the features included in your Plan for such Excess Use.</p>
<p>(viii)&nbsp;<u>Taxes</u>.&nbsp;Payment is exclusive of taxes.
You are responsible for any applicable sales, use, value-added, or excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties or charges of any kind, other than taxes on Pluralsight’s income, imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental entity on any amounts payable by you under these Terms of Use or any Sales Order whether or not such taxes are collected by Pluralsight.
When processing your Payment Method or invoicing, We may include a separate charge for such taxes and will remit taxes collected, if any, to the appropriate taxing authority.</p> 5.1 TEAM TRIAL / PILOT SUBSCRIPTION PLANS <p>Your Plan may begin with a free team trial (for businesses that checkout online) (“<b>Team Trial</b>”) or a free or paid pilot (for businesses that purchase through a sales-guided process) (“<b>Pilot</b>”).
The length of your Team Trial or Pilot will be set out at sign-up.
We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Team Trial or Pilot, including creating multiple free trial accounts, and to withdraw or to modify your Team Trial or Pilot at any time without prior notice and with no liability.
As a Team Trial or Pilot user, you acknowledge and agree that use and access to the Platform is subject to these Terms.</p>

You agree that access to the Platform during the Team Trial is governed by these Terms.
In order to initiate a free Team Trial, you must enter a valid credit card during checkout payment method—<i>we will not </i>charge your credit card during the Team Trial nor will we automatically convert your account into a paid Plan upon its expiration, unless we provide notification of automatic conversion and automatic renewal when you initiate your Team Trial.
If your Plan is not converted to a paid Plan, your users will lose access to the Platform at the end of such Team Trial.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<u>Pilot</u>.&nbsp;A Pilot is provisioned through a sales-guided checkout only, which may or may not include a fee for the Pilot depending on the scope, features, and number of users on your Pilot.
You agree that you and your users’ use of the Platform during the Pilot is governed by these Terms.
Unless otherwise set forth during checkout or a Sales Order, at the end of your Pilot we <i>will not</i> automatically convert your account into a paid Plan.
However, at the end of your Pilot, in order to continue using and accessing the Platform, you must convert your Pilot into a paid Plan and pay the applicable fee.</p> 5.2 COMPANY PARTNERSHIP PLAN <p>Your Plan may start with a trial, limited, or complete access to our Platform (“<b>Company Partnership Plan</b>”) facilitated through a company or community partnership between a third-party entity and Pluralsight (each, a “<b>Company Partner</b>”).

(b) infringed the intellectual property rights of a third party.
(c) posted, uploaded or transmitted unauthorized User Content.
or (d) violated or acted inconsistently with these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or any other applicable policies.
You agree that any such suspension, deactivation or termination for the foregoing reasons may be effected without prior notice to you and that Pluralsight will not be liable to you or any third party for any deactivation of your account or termination of your Plan.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<u>Customer’s Rights of Termination</u>.</p>
<p>(i) <u>Four Cause.</u> Either the business that purchased the Plan or Pluralsight may terminate the Plan or any Sales Order prior to its expiration if the other party breaches these Terms and fails to cure said breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof.
Except for instances arising from Pluralsight’s uncured breach, all fees or charges related to your Plan are non-refundable and all unpaid fees are due and payable immediately upon termination.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;<u>For Convenience</u>.
Unless otherwise specifically stated in terms specific to other products or Plans you purchase, a Plan may be terminated for convenience by sending written notice to Pluralsight at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Term.
however, in the event of any termination for convenience all fees paid are completely non-refundable and any fees unpaid at the time of such termination for convenience shall remain due and payable.
For avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Sales Order is for a multiple year Term, any termination under this section will only be permitted at the end of that Term.
With respect to any Term still in effect as of the date of such termination for convenience, and upon your request, your Plan will remain active to the end of your then-current Term to the extent your fee(s) have been paid.
provided that these Terms will continue in effect and govern such Term until its expiration or earlier termination for cause.
All termination requests made pursuant to this Section 12(b)(ii) must be emailed to&nbsp;manage-subscription@pluralsight.com no later than thirty (30) days in advance of the then-current Term.</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;<u>No Refunds</u>.&nbsp;Refunds will not be given if you cancel your Plan or delete your account prior to the end of your Term.</p>
