<p>Your Content</p>
<p>Nothing in these terms gives the operator any ownership rights in content or intellectual property that you share with the website, such as your account information and content you submit to the website.
Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the operator’s content or intellectual property, either.</p>
<p>Between you and the operator, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the website.
You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the website is from, sponsored by, or approved by the operator.
These terms do not obligate the operator to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit.</p>
<p>Content you submit to the website belongs to you, and you decide how to license it to others.
But at a minimum, you license the operator to provide content that you submit to the website to other users of the website.
That special license allows the operator to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the website.</p>
<p>When content you submit is removed from the website, whether by you or by the operator, the operator’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the operator’s backups, caches, and other systems.
Other licenses you give for your content may continue after your content is removed.
Those licenses may give others, or the operator itself, the right to share your content through the website again.</p>
<p>Others who receive content you submit to the website may violate the terms on which you license your content.
You agree that the operator will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>
<p>Your Responsibility</p>
<p>You agree to reimburse the operator for all the costs of legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account.
Both you and the operator agree to notify the other side of any legal claims you might have to reimburse the operator for as soon as possible.
If the operator fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to reimburse the operator for costs that you could have defended against or lessened with prompt notice.
You agree to allow the operator to take over investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims you would have to reimburse the operator for, and to cooperate with those efforts.
The operator agrees not to enter any settlement that admits you were at fault or requires you to do anything without your permission.</p>
<p>Disclaimers</p>
<p>You accept all risk of using the website and it content.
As far as the law allows, the operator provides the website and its content as is, without any warranty whatsoever.</p>
<p>The website may hyperlink to and integrate websites and services run by others.

Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.</p>
<p>Limits on Liability</p>
<p>The operator will not be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages operator personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.</p>

<p>Disputes</p>
<p>The governing law will govern these terms and all legal proceedings related to these terms or your use of the website.
If the operator doesn’t say what the governing law is, it’s the law under which the operator’s legal entity is formed.
If the operator doesn’t have a legal entity, it’s the law of the state where the operator is based.</p>
<p>Both sides agree to bring legal any proceedings related to this agreement only in the national and any national-subdivision courts located in the forum for disputes.
If the operator doesn’t say what the forum for disputes is, it’s the city with state and federal courts in the state of the governing law that is closest to where the operator is based.
If the operator isn’t based in that state, the forum for disputes is the capital of that state.</p>
<p>Neither you nor the operator will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.</p>
<p>If the governing law allows, both sides waive their rights to trial by jury.</p>
<p>Both sides agree to bring any legal claims related to this agreement as individuals, not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding.</p>
<p>General Terms </p>
<p>If a section of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that section should be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Otherwise, that section should be removed, and the others should be enforced as written.</p>
<p>You may not assign this agreement.
The operator may assign this agreement to any affiliate of the operator, any other company that obtains control of the operator, or any other company that buys assets of the operator related to the website.
Any attempt to assign against these terms has no legal effect.</p>
<p>Neither the exercise of any right under this agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this agreement, waives any other breach of this agreement.</p>
<p>These terms, plus the terms on any page incorporating them by reference, are all the terms of agreement between you and the operator about use of the website.
This agreement entirely replaces any other agreements about your use of the website, written or not.</p>
