When you visit our Website to browse, read or download information, we automatically collect information about your computer that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times, pages visited, and referring website addresses.
We may use Device Identifiable Information we collect to analyze trends, help administer the Web Site, track the movement of visitors, to learn about and determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Web Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Web Site or the Service and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.<br>
<br>We may also collect Device Identifiable Information through "cookies” or "web beacons” as explained below.<br>
<br>We may also collect information about your mobile device such as the type and model, operating system (e.g.

</p> We Engage in Interest-Based Advertising.
<p>ShaneCo.com and our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms.

<br>
<br>The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes.

We collect personal information about users over time and across different Web sites when you use this Web site or service.

We do this for many reasons, including the following:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>To engage in interest-based advertising as discussed above.</li>
<li>To understand the activities and behaviors of customers and platform users.</li>
<li>To recognize new visitors to our websites.</li>

For example, to avoid repeatedly showing you the same advertisements.</li>

<li>So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.
For example, to understand what ads are of interest to consumers.</li>
</ul>

These might be third party offers or products we think you might find interesting.
Depending on your choice we may send this type of information via email, text, call, push notifications in apps, or notifications by regular mail.
We also use information to customize offers you receive.
This includes using your shopping history on Affiliates or other third-party platforms.</p>
<p>We utilize Third-Party service providers, and use your information to perform those functions.&nbsp;We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
Also, in the unlikely event that Shane Co., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets</p>

</p> Your California privacy rights.
<p>This section of the Policy applies only to any natural person “enjoying the benefit and protection of laws and government” of California.
If you live in California you have certain rights under the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In accordance with the CCPA, this Policy discloses:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>what categories of personal information and the specific pieces of personal information we collect;<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>how that personal information is collected and how we use it;<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>the categories of personal information that are shared with third parties;.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>the categories or types of third parties with whom we share personal information.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a California resident you can request a list of the personal information we collected from you, a list of the personal information we have shared with third parties, and a list of the names of third parties with whom we have shared your personal information.
You may make such a request twice per year at no charge to you.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You may also request that we do not sell or disclose your personal information to third parties.
However, to provide you with most our services and access to our sites we need to share certain aspects of your personal information with our third party service providers.
Accordingly, such request may affect how you use and access our website and receive our services.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You may also request that we, and any third parties with whom we have shared your personal information, delete all your personal information.
Be advised that we may limit, postpone, or deny your request in order to: (i) facilitate any transaction that you initiate with us.
(ii) comply with a legal requirement or process.
(iii) comply with our security and safety measures.
and (iv) comply with any other exception provided under the CCPA.</p>
<p>
</p>

</p> Terms of Use, Notices, Revisions, Limitation on Liability, Arbitration <p>If you choose to visit ShaneCo.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Colorado.
If you have any concern about privacy at ShaneCo.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.
Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use will change also.
We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.
Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
<br>
<br>Except where prohibited, by visiting and using ShaneCo.com, you agree that: (1) any and all questions, controversies, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with the construction, validity, interpretation, and enforceability of this Privacy Policy shall be resolved exclusively by means of arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in Denver, Colorado, and shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action or representative action, and you agree that you shall not seek to aggregate any claims with other individuals.
(2) SHANE CO.’S LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, UNDER ANY WARRANTY, IN NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF $1.00 AND SHALL BE FURTHER LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN SUCH AMOUNTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHANE CO.
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, AND YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO CLAIM ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR ATTORNEYS FEES ARISING OUT OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED (EVEN IF YOU OR ANY OF YOUR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), AND TO RECOVER OTHER SUCH RELATED COSTS OF BRINGING A CLAIM, NOR SHALL AN ENTRANT BE ENTITLED TO RESCIND THIS AGREEMENT NOR SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR ANY OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
<br>
<br>Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator.
The place of arbitration shall be Denver, Colorado.
The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules of the State of Colorado or of any other jurisdiction.
Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three per party and shall be held within twenty days of the making of a request.
Additional depositions may be scheduled only with the permission of the arbitrators, and for good cause shown.
Each deposition shall be limited to a maximum of seven hours duration.
Time is of the essence for any arbitration under this agreement and arbitration hearings shall take place within ninety (90) days of filing and awards rendered within one hundred twenty (120) days.
The Arbitrator shall agree to these limits prior to accepting appointment.
The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute.
The prevailing party shall not be entitled to an award of attorney fees.
Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.
The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness.
In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator may require for the making of an award.
Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for above.</p>
<p>
</p> Rights for Residents of the European Union or Switzerland <p>This section of the Privacy Policy applies only if you use our website or Services covered by this Privacy Policy from a country that is a Member State of the European Union or Switzerland, and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Controller of Personal Information<br>
<br>To the extent that Shane Co.

<p>
</p>
<p>Legal Basis for Data Processing<br>
<br>We process Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above.
Our legal basis to process Personal Data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and Shane Co.
(for example, to facilitate a purchase on Shaneco.com, to provide you with other services that you request, or for resolving billing or customer service inquiries related to your use of our Services).
necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules or to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement).
necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the website and our Services).
and, where legally required and we have no other valid legal basis to process Personal Data, we will use consent by our customers (for example, to provide you with marketing information or share information with third parties), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by emailing privacy@shaneco.com) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.<br>
<br>In some instances, you may be required to provide us with Personal Data for processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our Services, and for you to use all the features of our website.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>International Transfers of Personal Data<br>
<br>The nature of Shane Co.’s business means that the Personal Data collected through our Services will be transferred to the United States.
Also, the Shane Co.
personnel and some of the third-parties to whom we disclose Personal Data (as set out above) are located in the United States.
We take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your Personal Data are bound to duties of confidentiality and we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred Personal Data, remains protected and secure.</p>
