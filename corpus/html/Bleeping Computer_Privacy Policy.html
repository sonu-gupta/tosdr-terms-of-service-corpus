About Us &amp.
Privacy Policy Overview
<p>
<strong>BleepingComputer</strong>®&nbsp;is a news and support site with technology news, tutorials, tips, reviews, and support forums to receive help from volunteers.
BleepingComputer was founded in 2004 by Lawrence Abrams and the site is located at the URL https://www.bleepingcomputer.com.
We are physically located in the United States of America.</p>
<p>
<strong>BleepingComputer</strong> is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors and members.
This privacy policy ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") is designed to inform you about the type of information that Bleeping Computer LLC ("<strong>BleepingComputer</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" and "<strong>us</strong>" ) may gather or collect from you in connection with your use of this site ("<strong>Website</strong>", "<strong>site</strong>").
It also explains the conditions under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to that information.</p>
<p>As a rule, BleepingComputer does not collect personally identifiable information other than IP addresses unless you register for an account on the site.
If you register for an account, you will be required to provide a display name and login name of your choice (we suggest that you do not use your real names), and an email address.
There are also fields for specifying your location, birthday, and gender, but these are optional.</p>
<p>We also work with third-parties to display advertisements, social sharing links, article comments, affiliate marketing, and analytics.
All third party partners have assured BleepingComputer that they are working within the laws and guidelines of a BleepingComputer visitor's country.
All third party partners will be outlined later in this document.</p>
<p>We are also committed to offering GDPR&nbsp;compliance, allowing our users to opt out of data collection, and to understand their rights.</p>

<p>This policy will be updated from time to time in order to list new features on the site, new third-party services that we use, or updates to comply with privacy regulations.
When changes are made we will update the date at the top of this Privacy Policy and retain a link to the previous policy.
It is advised that you periodically check this policy to see if anything has been changed.</p>
Registering an account at BleepingComputer
<p>BleepingComputer provides the ability for visitors to register a free account so that they can make comments to news articles or make posts in the forums.
When registering an account it is required to provide an email address, a login name, and a display name that is publicly visible.
When selecting the Display Name, you should not use your real name unless you do not care if it is publicly displayed.</p>
<p>In addition to this information, in order to register an account you will be required to validate your account's email address, agree to BleepingComputer's User Agreement, provide consent to this privacy policy, and agree to our Forum Rules.</p>
<p>It should be noted that when you register an account, you agree to allow BleepingComputer to display your forum posts indefinitely.
We will be happy to remove any personal information or disassociate posts with an account at the request of the member.</p>
<p>As a benefit of registering an account, you will no longer see advertisements on the site when you are logged in.</p>
What data we collect and how we use it
<p>When you use BleepingComputer, there is certain data that is automatically collected by our server and web site.
As previously stated, if you decide to register an account, additional data is also collected in order to create the account.
This data is necessary for the proper operation of the site and to provide the features you would expect from it.
We have described what data is collected by BleepingComputer below.</p>
Registration Information
<p>When a user registers an account on the site to become a member, they must provide a login name, display name, and email address.
When registering, their IP address at the time of the registration will be associated with the account for security purposes.
This IP address is not publicly displayed.</p>
<p>Once registered, a member can optionally add their birthday, gender, location, and other information.
This information can be removed at any time.</p>
Forum Posts &amp.
Status Updates
<p>A registered and logged in member may create new topics or reply to existing topics in the forums.
When posting to the forums, their IP address is associated with the post for security reasons, such as the proper operation of spam filters and moderation tools.
This IP address is not publicly displayed.</p>
<p>Any data that is posted to the site is completely up to the member and should be sanitized of all personal data.
If a member posts content that contains personal information by accident they can edit the post and remove the personal information themselves within 24 hours.
Otherwise they need to contact us to edit the post and remove the personal information.</p>
<p>Registered members also have the ability to post status updates in their user profiles.
Like posts, what content is posted is up to the user.
Status replies can be removed by the member or they can contact us to have it removed.</p>
Images, Documents, and Attachments
<p>If you register an account and make a post in our forums, depending on the forum you may have the ability to upload images, data files, and text files.
This is completely optional and up to the member, but if a member does upload content, they should make sure to strip any personal information from it.
Members can manage their attachments and delete any that they wish.</p>
Contact Information
<p>When registering an account or using the Contact Us form on the site, users may provide contact information such as their name, address, and email address.
This information is used only to contact the member as necessary and is never shared with third parties.</p>
<p>Registered members have the ability to subscribe to articles, topics, or forums to receive notifications when new content has been posted to BleepingComputer.com.
BleepingComputer will send these notifications to the email address associated with the account.
Users can disable these notifications at any time in their settings.</p>
<p>From time to time, BleepingComputer may host contests that requires personal information to be submitted.
This information will only be shared as needed to enter the contest and send a prize if the member wins.</p>
Comments
<p>We use a custom commenting system for some of our articles and Disqus for others.
For our custom commenting system, only registered and logged in users may post a comment.
When doing so, they can edit their comment within 24 hours of its creation and must contact us afterwards to delete it.</p>
Embedded 3rd party content
<p>BleepingComputer, and its users, may embed content such as images, Tweets, videos, and more from third-party sites into articles, forum posts, tutorials, and other user submitted content.
When a visitor browses to a page that contains embedded content it will be retrieved from a third-party site.
BleepingComputer has no control over what tracking and cookies these third-party sites may utilize.</p>
Analytics and Server Logs
<p>When anyone, regardless of whether you are a member or guest, visits BleepingComputer, our server will automatically record the IP address of the user and save it to our server logs.
This is common practice for all web servers and we only use this information for security reasons or when required to legally.
These logs are only saved for 7 days.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer also uses Google Analytics to provide anonymized and aggregated data about our visitors.
This allows us to see what content our visitors like the most, what sections get the most traffic, and allow us to provide the experience you expect to receive from BleepingComputer.com.
In order to anonymize the collection of data in Analytics, we have enabled the "IP Anonymization" feature and disabled the "Remarketing" and "Advertising Reporting Features" features.</p>

California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants California residents five new rights regarding how websites collect personal data, regardless of whether the visitor is a customer or any other relationship with the covered company.
</p>
<p>These five rights are explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to request disclosure of your business' data collection and sales practices in connection with the requesting consumer, including the categories of personal information you have collected, the source of the information, your use of the information and, if the information was disclosed or sold to third parties, the categories of personal information disclosed or sold to third parties and the categories of third parties to whom such information was disclosed or sold;</li>
