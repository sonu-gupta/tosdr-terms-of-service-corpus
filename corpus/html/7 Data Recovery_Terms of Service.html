<p>
<u>How to Recover Your Files with Disk Drill:</u>
</p>
<br>
<p>In order to see if Your file(s) can be recovered properly, You should (1) download CleverFiles’ free Disk Drill Basic to run a scan on Your device.
A scan of Your device with Disk Drill Basic will generate a list of damaged, deleted, or inaccessible files that can be potentially recovered.
Secondly, You should (2) preview the entirety of the file(s) generated by the Disk Drill scan in order to filter which files will be recoverable and which may not be recoverable.
If a file is fully previewable (i.e., You scrolled through the entire preview and it was free of internal errors) it can be successfully recovered.
In order to recover such a successfully-previewed file(s), if You did not enable Disk Drill’s data protection features in the past, You must (3) purchase either Disk Drill PRO (for personal use) or Disk Drill Enterprise (for commercial use), and then follow the easy-to-use steps provided within the Disk Drill application.</p>
<br>
<p>After a scan with Disk Drill Basic, if a file(s) is not fully previewable (i.e., You cannot view the entire file or the file contains errors) the particular file(s) still may be recoverable.
however, the failure of the file to properly preview means there is a chance this particular file(s) is damaged and will be unrecoverable.
If You accept this risk, simply purchase either Disk Drill PRO or Disk Drill Enterprise and likewise follow the easy-to-use steps provided to attempt to recover Your file(s)—though note that by making such purchase You explicitly accept the aforementioned risks and all purchases are final.
However, if You are unwilling to accept the risk or would like to consider Your options before You purchase Disk Drill PRO or Disk Drill Enterprise, please contact CleverFiles’ Help Center who can provide You with assistance and information pertaining to the file(s) You wish to recover.</p>

<strong>26.4 Trademark Infringement Notice</strong>.
508 Software recognizes the importance of trademarks and takes allegations of trademark infringement very seriously.
If You are the trademark owner (or the authorized representative of the owner), You can report a claim of trademark infringement to 508 Software at help@cleverfiles.com, “ATTN: Trademark Infringement”.
While 508 Software does not adjudicate disputes between parties in connection with trademark infringement or any other matter, 508 Software will make good faith effort to address Your concerns, including (in some instances) removing the infringing content or disabling access to the infringing content.
However, in order to be assured that the claimed content is indeed infringing, 508 Software may require proof from You, such as, for example a trademark registration number or a court order finding trademark infringement.
Some Third-Party Material(s) and Products on the Website are created and operated by third-party developers or service providers.
As such, 508 Software does not have the ability to control the content made available through these applications or services.

<p>
<strong>31.3 Severability</strong>.
The Terms of Service will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
If for any reason any provision of the Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then (i) such provision will be interpreted, construed, or reformed to the extent necessary to render the same outcome as attempted in the original writing (or as close thereto as possible), and (ii) such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of the Terms of Service.
However, if any material limitation or restriction is deemed illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable in regards to the User’s License (as outlined in <u>Section 4</u>, above), the License will immediately terminate.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>31.4 Waiver.
Terms of Service Rights</strong>.
In the case 508 Software or You waive any breach or rights under the Terms of Service, this waiver will affect only that particular situation and will not waive any other future breach or rights.
Additionally, the failure of 508 Software to enforce the Terms of Service under strict performance will not be construed as a waiver of 508 Software’s rights and remedies, herein, nor shall the particular failure to enforce said situation stand as precedent that 508 Software does not enforce the Terms of Service under strict performance.
508 Software fully intends to enforce the Terms of Service in strict performance.
however, 508 Software reserves the right to enforce and waive breaches, remedies, and rights on a case-by-case basis.
Any such waiver, as discussed above, must be made in writing and executed by 508 Software, and when appropriate You, in order for any effect to be given to said waiver.
No waiver will be effective without 508 Software’s authorized signature, and when Your signature is required, no waiver also will be effective without Your authorized signature, unless 508 Software can prove reasonable efforts were given or bad faith is at issue.</p>
