</p> Active Information Collection <p> Like many websites, this Website actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail and/or feedback forms.
Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and sales delivery, billing and credit card information).
<i>
</i> Some areas of this Website may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as other promotions).
You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what information is optional.

We may disclose your personally identifiable information to other affiliates worldwide that agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
In addition, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties, located in the United States and/or any other country, but only: <i>
</i> to contractors we use to support our business (e.g., fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions), in which case we will require such third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this site to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

<i>
</i> Remember that the information provided by this site is for general background purposes and is not intended to be used in connection with, or as a substitute for, medical diagnosis or treatment by a trained professional.
You should always consult your own physician about any healthcare questions you may have, especially before trying a new medication, diet, fitness program, or approach to health care issues.

To not receive future e-mail communications from Tenamax Male Enhancement, please go to tenamax-male-enhancement.com or contact us at 1-866-455-5202, 24/7 Monday to Friday </p> Security of Information <p> You can be assured that personal information collected through the Website is secure and is maintained in a manner consistent with current industry standards.
The importance of security for all personal information associated with our subscribers is of utmost concern to us.
Your personal information is protected in several ways.
Your personal information resides on a secure server that only selected Tenamax Male Enhancement employees and contractors have access to via password.
In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions.
They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.
<i>
</i> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the internet which are beyond our control.
(b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed.
and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.
Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this Website, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.
<i>
</i>
</p> Passive Information Collection <p> As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.
<i>
</i> This Website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer).
We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our Website, and administer and improve services to our consumers.
<i>
</i> A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences.
<i>
</i> "Session cookies" are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off.
Session cookies are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect aggregate statistical information.
This Website uses session cookies.
<i>
</i> "Persistent cookies" are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie.
Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., username), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences.
This Website uses persistent cookies.
<i>
</i> "Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer.
This Website uses Internet tags.
"Navigational data" ("log files," "server logs," and "clickstream" data) and "Internet Tags" are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.
This Website uses navigational data.
