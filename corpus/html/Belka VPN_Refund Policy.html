</p>
<p>You may cancel your account with a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase
</p>
<p>(“Money Back Guarantee”).
</p>
<p>Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of
</p>
<p>BelkaVPN, if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable
</p>
<p>during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact BelkaVPN
</p>
<p>to resolve the issue.
In this case, BelkaVPN may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata
</p>
<p>refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.
</p>
<p>Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of
</p>
<p>payment used for purchase.
All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount
</p>
<p>could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or bitcoin.
</p>
<p>Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or
</p>
<p>purchasing of additional licenses under the same account, shall constitute a waiver of the
</p>
<p>Money Back Guarantee option.
To request a refund under the Money Back Guarantee, send
</p>
<p>an email with your request to the following email address:
</p>
<p>support@belkavpn.com
</p>
<p>Users whose subscriptions are billed as an in-app purchases through the Apple App Store
</p>
<p>(iTunes) do not have access to the BelkaVPN 30-day money-back guarantee.
Instead, users
</p>
<p>can request refunds through the App Store, which are issued solely at the discretion of Apple
</p>
<p>Support.
