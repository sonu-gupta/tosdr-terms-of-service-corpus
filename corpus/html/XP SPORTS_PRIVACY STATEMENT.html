</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are transferred to your computer’s hard disk by a Site.

When you visit a Site, we will automatically collect cookies once you consent.

See our&nbsp;Cookie Settings&nbsp;for further information.</p>

<strong>10) Other Technologies</strong>
</p>
<p>DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across sites by using browser settings.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard.
While some progress has been made, it has been slow.
No standard has been adopted to this date and, as a result, we are not equipped to respond to “do not track” signals.</p>
<p>For more information on how to block and opt out from tracking technologies used on our Site, please see our&nbsp;Cookie Settings.</p>
<p>Automated Decision-Making<br>We do no use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning or otherwise significantly affecting you.</p>
