         About this Privacy Policy
<p>Your privacy and the privacy of your personal information are very important to us and this policy outlines how we collect, use and disclose your personal information.</p>
<p>
The Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia Inc (ABN 33 212 133 120) and its related and subsidiary companies, including companies such as RAC Insurance Pty Ltd, and businesses not using RAC as their primary brand, collect and handle your personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APP’s), under the the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).</p>
<p>
For the purposes of this policy, the term “RAC”, “we” or “us” means either The Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia Inc and its related and subsidiary companies, or any one of those entities, as the case may be, unless otherwise noted.<br>
By providing your personal information to us, you agree to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information (including sensitive information such as health information) in accordance with this privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you do have any questions or concerns about privacy please speak with one of our Sales and Service Consultants at any RAC Member Service Centre, call 13 17 03 or write to us.&nbsp;</p> What is personal information?
<p>Personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: (a) whether the information or opinion is true or not.
and (b) whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.</p>
What is sensitive information?
<p>Sensitive personal information includes information or an opinion about matters like your health, criminal history or racial or ethnic origin.
In limited circumstances, we need to collect this information from you to assist you.
For example, we may need to collect information about your health so RAC travel can arrange travel insurance for you.
We will not collect sensitive information about you unless you consent to the collection and the information is directly related to our activities.</p>
How we collect your personal information
<p>Many of our products and services require you to give us personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and credit card number, either to store within your member account, or to help us or third party agents, contractors or organisations engaged by us to provide to you our products or services.</p>
<p>We normally collect personal information directly from you over the phone, face-to-face in an RAC Member Service Centre or agency, through the mail using paper application forms or electronically over the internet, through RAC mobile apps or other communication tools.
However, in some circumstances, we collect personal information from a third party.</p>
<p>RAC also obtains personal information through the use of website analytics tools, on where, when and how you use our products and services and to authenticate your access to products and services from us and our service providers and agents.</p>
<p>
If you wish to know more general details about the personal information that we collect, please speak with a Sales and Service Consultant at any RAC Member Service Centre or call 13 17 03</p>
What if you choose not to provide us with personal information?
<p>Where practical we will give you the option of not identifying yourself, or using a pseudonym, when dealing with us.
However, the nature of our business may mean that, if you do not provide us with the personal information we need, we will be unable to administer and manage the product or service that you wish to purchase.
We will also be unable to assess your application, where one is required, for example to purchase an insurance policy or arrange a personal loan.
We will advise you if your failure to provide personal information may jeopardise your application.</p> How we use and disclose your personal information?

We use your personal information in the course of administering and managing the products or services you have with us, including for marketing and promotional purposes and dealing with any complaints or claims.&nbsp;<br>
