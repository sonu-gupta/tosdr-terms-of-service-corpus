<p>You have certain choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information, as described below.</p>
<p>
<u>Access</u>: You may have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months.</p>
<p>
<u>Deletion</u>: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>How to Submit a Request</b>: To submit an access or deletion request to Samsung Account, click here https://www.samsung.com/us/privacy/ccpa/ or call us at 1-800-SAMSUNG (1-800-726-7864).

</p>
<p>
<b>Verifying Requests</b>: To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.
If you have a Samsung.com account, we will verify your identity by requiring you to sign in to your account.
If you do not have a Samsung.com account, or an email address on file with us, then there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by the CCPA.
This is because historically Samsung has not linked device identifiers or advertising IDs to named actual persons.
Accordingly, if you do not have an account with us, or an email address on file, and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, we will not be able to process your request at this time.</p>

<b>Additional Information:</b> If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.</p>
