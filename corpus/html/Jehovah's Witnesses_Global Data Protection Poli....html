         Global Data Protection Policy of Jehovah’s Witnesses
<p>Updated April 1, 2018</p> Global Data Protection Policy of Jehovah’s Witnesses <p>The worldwide religious organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses (“religious organization”) respects individuals’ rights of privacy and of protection of personal data.
The religious organization recognizes the necessity of open and frank communication and of the collection of personal and sensitive personal data in order to administer to the needs of individual Jehovah’s Witnesses and to accomplish its religious and charitable activity, as well as the corresponding necessity to maintain confidentiality and ensure that information is adequately protected.
(Proverbs 15:22.
25:9) We highly value confidentiality.—Proverbs 20:19.</p>
<p>Various countries have enacted data protection laws to ensure individuals’ rights of privacy.
The religious organization, including its local branch offices, has a long-standing history of respecting privacy rights and maintaining confidentiality, even before the enactment of such data protection laws.
The religious organization will continue to protect information disclosed to it in harmony with its long-standing practice.</p>
