Returns and Refunds Policy<ol>
<li>
<strong>Refunds Generally.
</strong>‍If your Transaction is prevented from completing, the “Order Status” page will indicate whether or not the failed Transaction will result in a refund of the User’s deposited digital asset or the outgoing digital asset which you sought to purchase.
In nearly all cases where a Transaction fails, the digital asset sold by the User will automatically be refunded to the User if the Order Status page indicates the Transaction failed by displaying “failed,” or the Transaction is stuck in “awaiting” “pending confirms,” or “awaiting” stages.
In nearly all other cases, the outgoing digital asset will be sent to the User if the Order Status indicates a successful Transaction by displaying “Done” or “Completed.” ShapeShift will handle refund requests from Users on a case-by-case basis.
Any decisions by ShapeShift with respect to the refunds or related exchanges are final</li>
<li>
<strong>Seeking a Refund Manually.</strong> If you need to seek a refund for a failed Transaction, you must submit a refund request by promptly emailing our customer support here or making a support request here after the Transaction is initiated through the Service.
ShapeShift will send any approved refund to the refund address that you provide us at the initiation of a Transaction.
ShapeShift does not guarantee that it will be able to fulfill your refund request.
If you do not timely submit a refund request to us promptly after becoming aware of an issue with a Transaction or if you do not include a refund address in the request, your refund may be delayed or we may not be able to fulfill it entirely.</li>
<li>
<strong>‍Refund Fees.
</strong>All Transactions from ShapeShift to a User’s outgoing digital asset wallet are subject to all posted fees, including incoming and outgoing Miner Fees, which may be deducted from any refund.
</li>
<li>
<strong>‍Refund Period.
</strong>You have a maximum of 90 days to reclaim any digital assets that are held in the ShapeShift system due to any error, whether by you or us.
Refund requests submitted after such period will only be approved in our discretion if we can verify that the applicable digital assets belong to you.
Any decisions by ShapeShift with respect to refunds in these circumstances are final.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unsupported Digital Assets.
</strong>Any digital assets that we do not support that are sent to unrelated or inaccurate wallets through the Service cannot be extracted or returned.
ShapeShift reserves the right to determine whether to assist or attempt to remedy effects of the foregoing sentence’s scenario on a case-by-case basis.
Any such decision by ShapeShift is final.
If a particular digital asset for which a refund is requested is not offered on the Service at the time of a refund request, we cannot and will not process a refund or return until the digital asset returns to the Service, which may never occur.</li>
<li>
<strong>‍Minimum Refund Amounts.
</strong>Transactions under the amount posted on the fee schedule on the Website are too small to be refunded due to the Miner Fee and administrative costs and ShapeShift has no obligation to honor any such related refund request.
ShapeShift will not refund any digital assets that are worth less than the posted amount.
You are advised not to use the Service for orders under this size.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cross-Chain Recovery Program.
</strong>Please use extreme caution when sending digital assets to ShapeShift or the Service and make sure to confirm that you are sending the correct type of digital asset to the correct address.
A transfer of digital assets to ShapeShift that is mistakenly sent to an address of a different digital asset is a “Cross-Chain Transaction”.
Recovery of Cross-Chain Transactions is a risky and time-consuming process.
The level of complexity and risk depends both on the type of digital asset and the address used for the Transaction.
Not all Cross-Chain Transactions are recoverable, and digital assets sent to the wrong address are at risk of recovery by bad actors not associated with ShapeShift.<br>
<br>SHAPESHIFT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY CROSS-CHAIN TRANSACTIONS INITIATED BY YOU OR ANY OTHER USER.
If you request assistance in recovering a Cross-Chain Transaction, ShapeShift may decide in its sole discretion whether to assist or attempt to recover such Cross-Chain Transaction.
There is no time limit for any such discretionary recovery attempts and ShapeShift will not be liable for a failed recovery of any Cross-Chain Transaction.
If any such recovery is attempted, ShapeShift may assess you with a fee that reflects the level of effort and developer time consumed on the amount or value of the digital asset.
You acknowledge and consent to the assessment of this fee when making any such recovery request.<br>
<br>If you would like to ask ShapeShift to attempt to recover your digital assets from a Cross-Chain Transaction that you initiated, please reach out to our support team with the details of the Transaction by by emailing our customer support here or making a support request here.
Please include your Account email address, digital asset name, address, and transaction ID.
ShapeShift will evaluate your request and determine in its sole discretion whether to initiate recovery procedures.
You acknowledge that even if ShapeShift decides to attempt a Cross-Chain Transaction recovery on your behalf, we make no guarantee that any such attempted recovery will ultimately be successful.
</li>
</ol>ix.
FOX Tokens<ol>
<li>
<strong>FOX Token Basics.
</strong>We created a standard ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that can be accessed through most wallets that support Ethereum called the FOX token (each a “<strong>FOX Token</strong>”).
ShapeShift intends to use FOX Tokens to provide loyalty benefits in connection with a User’s use of the Service, such as commission-free trading or other enhanced features on the Service.
ShapeShift may change, add, or remove any benefits associated with FOX Tokens at any time, in its sole discretion.
Each User’s FOX Token balance will be displayed in the Service’s Account portal.
ShapeShift may place any restrictions on FOX Tokens’ interaction with the Service, including minimum use or withdrawal limits.</li>
<li>
<strong>How to Obtain FOX Tokens.
</strong>ShapeShift does not presently sell FOX Tokens.
ShapeShift distributes FOX Tokens to verified Users in a variety of amounts based on various promotions or for completing certain actions including:<br>‍<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Successfully passing our verification process;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii).
Successfully executing a trade through the Service;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii).
Referring a new User to the Service.
and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv).
Trying new features of the Service and providing related Ideas to ShapeShift.<br>
<br>Users may receive different amounts of FOX Tokens for completing the same actions and ShapeShift retains sole discretion in determining whether a User will receive FOX Tokens for certain activities and how many FOX Tokens will be allocated to each User based on the details of each FOX Tokens offering or promotion.
By entering an Ethereum address for ShapeShift to send any applicable FOX Tokens to, you thereby represent that you control that Ethereum address.
By redeeming and receiving a FOX Tokens, you consent to us sending you email and other communications related to FOX Tokens.
<strong>‍</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Commission-Free Trading.
</strong>For each FOX Token held in a digital wallet linked to your Account, we will waive our normal commissions or trading spreads on the Service up to US$10 of your trade volume per rolling 30-day period (in total, a User’s “<strong>Commission-Free Trading</strong>”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, <strong>STANDARD MINER FEES APPLY TO ALL COMMISSION FREE TRADING.</strong> For example, 100 FOX Tokens allows you up to US$1,000 of Commission-Free Trading in a 30-day period.
Utilizing the Commission-Free Trading does not require the FOX Tokens to be burned, spent, or locked up.
If a User performs a Transaction that is only partially covered by the User’s Commission-Free Trading for that 30-day period, then the rate will be a pro-rated blend of the commission-free rate and the traditional retail commission rate.
A User utilizing the Service through one of our API partners will receive the same Commission-Free Trading benefits as long as that User holds the FOX Tokens in a wallet connected to the Service.
<strong>‍</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The FOX Back Program.
</strong>For a limited time, we will distribute FOX Tokens to Users who complete our verification process or perform certain trades on the Service.
The amount of FOX Tokens awarded through this program will be specified in the associated promotional materials or otherwise displayed on the Service before you initiate a qualifying Transaction.
<strong>‍</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>No Resale Value.
</strong>FOX TOKENS ARE SOLELY PROVIDED TO CREATE A LOYALTY PROGRAM FOR VERIFIED USERS.
FOX TOKENS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE AN INVESTMENT AND THERE IS NO EXPECTATION THAT FOX TOKENS WILL EVER HAVE LIQUIDITY, ANY MEASURABLE VALUE, OR APPRECIATE IN VALUE.
SHAPESHIFT WILL NOT ADVOCATE OR PROMOTE THE RESALE OF FOX TOKENS TO ANY OTHER PERSON OR OTHERWISE SUPPORT THE CREATION OF ANY BENEFITS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR FOX TOKENS.<strong>
</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Legal Risks.
</strong>You acknowledge that<strong>
</strong>current or future regulations could make ShapeShift or FOX Tokens illegal in some jurisdictions, or for some categories of Users, which could possibly result our winding down of ShapeShift, the Service, or FOX Tokens, or a decrease in value of ShapeShift or the FOX Tokens.
Because FOX Tokens have not been formally classified by or registered with any regulatory agency, subsequent determinations by any regulator may: prevent certain persons from using or holding FOX Tokens in the future or cause the functionality, access to, or demand for the FOX Tokens could be reduced materially.<strong>‍</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your Additional Acknowledgments.
</strong>By redeeming, earning, receiving, or holding a FOX Token, you acknowledge that: <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i).
FOX Tokens are not an investment and that you have no expectation of economic benefit or profit (other than the benefits of specific ShapeShift loyalty programs).
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;(ii).
You will hold FOX Tokens solely for the loyalty program benefits, for your own use, and not with an intention to sell or otherwise distribute any FOX Tokens;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii).
By virtue of your ownership of FOX Tokens, you will have no equity or other ownership interest in ShapeShift or the Service and will not have any voting rights with respect to any matters relating to either.
and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv).
You have no expectations that there is or ever will be any market for transfer or resale of the FOX Tokens, that ShapeShift has not represented that there will ever be such a market, and that ShapeShift will not help create or support such a market.
