What Personal Information do we collect? <p>
<em>Personal Information We Request for Use of the Services.&nbsp.
</em>When you download the App and in order to use the Services, we require you to establish an account, for which we collect and store the following: your name, email, password, telephone number, the identification number for your locksets (“Products”) and user and account verification identifiers.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>Personal Information collected based on your use of the Services.
&nbsp;</em>When you use the Services, we collect Personal Information that you may provide about yourself, such as user-name, as well as Personal Information about other people who have access to your Products, such as other family members, guests, and service providers like gardeners, house cleaners and/or others (“Invitees”).&nbsp.
For example, you may include email addresses and telephone numbers of Invitees who you are allowing to access your Products.&nbsp.
We may ask for access to your contact list, and you may consent to provide access to such list, which includes Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information that you may include in help requests, customer service correspondence and/or in any feedback, you send to us.&nbsp.
We also collect Personal Information included in messages that you may send from within the App whether those messages are sent to us, an Invitee, or a third party.</p>
<p>Also, if you enable the Auto-Unlock feature, the App will request your consent in order to track your location in order to determine when your App nears Products that you have permission to access (e.g., when you are near home).
Location information will only be stored on your device, and not on our servers.
This information will tell your mobile device to start listening for your lock more often (increasing the polling).
This improves the device’s performance and saves your mobile device’s battery life.</p>
<p>
<em>Personal Information we automatically collect.
&nbsp;</em>When you use the App, we will create a user ID for your account and we also gather the following information for purposes of providing the Services when you download the App and/or access the Services: usage data about how and when you interact with the Services and Products, logs of when your Products are locked/unlocked, logs of those who lock/unlock your Products, the people that you invite to use your Products, and those people who may invite you to use their products.</p>
<p>We also collect the following information about the devices on which the App is downloaded and the Products you use: the operating system of the device on which the App is downloaded (e.g., you, your invitees), the version of the App on such devices, information about your Products, including serial numbers, MAC address, software versions on such Products and installation dates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, if you choose to use the App to connect your Products with other products and services through the “Connected by” feature, we will collect information about your use of those other products.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Personal Information we receive when you use third party products and services</em>
</strong>
<strong>.
</strong>If you access the Services through a third-party (e.g., by managing your device via your television remote or connecting your device to your home security system), use third-party applications or services through the “Works With” feature, otherwise use a third party service provider in connection with the Services and Products, or request or authorize us to give access or data to a third-party service provider (e.g., a delivery service, property management or rental service), then that third party will send us data about you, such as an user ID.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Invitees.</em>
</strong>
<em>&nbsp.
</em>As part of our Services, you may give Invitees permission levels to access your Products - e.g., to unlock and lock your door, and possibly even to pass this access along to others.
Needless to say, you must be careful of the people that you invite and the access that you give them.
You are responsible for all uses of your account, so be careful to secure this information and only give access to people you trust.
Additionally, certain portions of your Personal Information, as well as other information about your use of the Service and your Products may be shared with Invitees, such as your name and the status of the lock (e.g., locked or unlocked).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In connection with the guest invitation process, we may ask for access to your contact list.
We will only store information for contacts that you add as guests.
We will only access and store such information with your express consent.</p>
<p>If you are an Invitee, we collect your Personal Information when you use the Services and Products, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
&nbsp;All such information (including your service usage information) is subject to and will be used and disclosed as set forth in, this Privacy Policy.</p> 2.
