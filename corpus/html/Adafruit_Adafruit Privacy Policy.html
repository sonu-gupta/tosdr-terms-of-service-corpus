The CCPA defines personal information to include online identifiers, including IP address, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs.
The law also defines a “sale” to include simply making data available to third parties.&nbsp.
Because we let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, mobile IDs through our sites and apps when you use our online services, but do not “sell” any other types of personal information, we provide our “Do Not Sell My Info” disclosures in this section.
Other information related to your rights under the CCPA is contained in the California Rights section of this statement.</p>
<p>

<p>Cookie Controls.
Many web browsers accept cookies by default.
Users can usually change their browser's settings to reject and/or to remove many cookies.
Please note also that choosing to reject or remove cookies may prevent certain features or services of our site from working properly.
Since cookie opt-out preferences are also stored in a cookie in a browser, please also note that deleting cookies, using a different browser, or buying a new computer, may require renewal of opt-out choices.</p>
<p>Do Not Track.
Do Not Track&nbsp;(DNT) is a technology which allows users to tell sites they visit that they don’t want to be tracked.
It does this by including a special header with each request the browser sends.
Where possible without breaking the functionality of our site, we try to honor Do Not Track headers by attempting to serve only third-party services which themselves promise to honor Do Not Track.
However, because not all our necessary third-party service providers honor Do Not Track and because implementations may change from time to time, we cannot guarantee that we will always be successful in all cases.</p>
<p>While we and others give users the choices described in this policy, there are many ways through which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate user choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of nor honor every such mechanism.</p>
<p>Mobile advertising ID controls.
iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.</p>
<p>Email web beacons.
Most email clients have settings which allow you prevent the automatic downloading of images, which will disable web beacons in the email messages you read.</p>
<p>

<b>Retention of Personal Information</b>
</p>
<p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.

We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>
<p>We transfer personal information from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.

<b>California Privacy Rights</b>
</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), beginning January 2020 you have certain rights with respect to that information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right to Know.
You have the right to request that companies provide you with the following information:</p>
<p>(1) The categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</p>
<p>(2) The categories of sources from which we collect personal information.</p>
<p>(3) The purposes for collecting, using, or selling personal information.</p>
<p>(4) The categories of third parties with which we share personal information.</p>
<p>(5) For companies that disclose personal information for a business purpose, the categories of personal information disclosed about you for a business purpose.
Note that the CCPA defines “business purpose” broadly.
and because we use service providers for a number of business purposes that require access to our systems that hold personal information (such as supplying cloud data storage, maintaining the security of our systems, and providing customer support), in the past 12 months we have disclosed for a business purpose data from all of the categories of personal information that we maintain.</p>
<p>(6) The categories of personal information we have sold about you (if any) for each category of third parties to which the personal information was sold.
Note that the CCPA defines “sell” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our use of third party service providers described may be considered a “sale” under that definition.
In particular, we let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, and cookie IDs through our sites and apps when you use our online services, but do not “sell” any other types of personal information.
For more information, review the Third Party Sites and Services section of this privacy statement above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make such requests, contact us at the contact information set forth below.
Note that we have provided the information described in (2)-(6) in this privacy statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right to Delete.
You also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right to Opt-Out.
You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” of personal information.
To do so, you can opt-out of our use of certain third-party sites and services as described in the Third Party Sites and Services section of this privacy statement.</p>
<p>You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA.
Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
You have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising rights set out in the CCPA</p>
<p>
<b>Notification of law enforcement or governmental requests</b>
