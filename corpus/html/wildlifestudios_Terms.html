<p>Welcome to the Wildlife Studios Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”).
This is a legal agreement between you and Wildlife Studios Limited, an Irish corporation (“<strong>Wildlife</strong>”), regarding the Services you use from us.
“<strong>Services</strong>” means collectively, and sometimes individually, the following: (a) each of our Games, and (b) any websites, software or other services we provide with or in support of a Game, whether or not they are installed or used on a computer, console, or a mobile device.
“Game” means our game that you download and access that is subject to these Terms, regardless of where you download and/or access it, and any documentation, software, updates, Virtual Goods and Content (each defined below) included in it.</p>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR USERS IN THE US ONLY: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.
PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 19 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND GOVERNING LAW” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING THE PROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION).
THESE TERMS ALSO INCLUDE A WAIVER OF RIGHTS BY YOU TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US AND A LIMITATION ON DAMAGES THAT YOU CAN COLLECT FROM US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS.</strong>
</p>1.
Defined Terms<p>You’ll notice some capitalized terms in these Terms.
They’re called “defined terms,” and we use them so we don’t have to repeat the same language again and again, and to make sure that the use of these terms is consistent throughout the Terms.&nbsp;We’ve included the defined terms throughout because we want it to be easy for you to read them in context.</p>2.
Additional Terms<p>Some Services may be available (or only available) through accessing (or downloading from) a third-party platform or store, including but not limited to the Steam game platform, the Google Play Store, and Apple App Store (each, an “<strong>App Store</strong>”).
Your use of the Services is also governed by any applicable agreements you have with any App Store (the “<strong>App Store Agreement(s)</strong>”).
In the event of a conflict between any other App Store Agreement(s), from which you acquire one of our Games, and these Terms with respect to your use of the Services, including our Games, these Terms will take priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection of information from you and related to the Services (whether obtained through an App Store or not) is governed by our Privacy Policy at https://wildlifestudios.com/privacy-policy.
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect from and about you.</p>3.

If you are at least the relevant minimum age but are not legally considered an adult in your jurisdiction, you must ask one of your parents (or legal guardians) to read these Terms and accept it on your behalf, and to create a Game Account.
Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of their minor children when using a Game Account they created, or any of our Services, and if you are a parent or guardian accepting these Terms, you understand and agree that you will be responsible for all uses of the Game Account and our Services by your minor child whether or not you authorized such uses.

<li>
<u>Account Creation</u>.
To access parts of a Game, you may need to create an in-game account (your “<strong>Game Account</strong>”).

You may be able to create your Game Account using an existing account you have with us or your email address.
To the extent you create your Game Account through the use of a third-party account (for example, your account with Facebook or Google), we may access certain personal information that the third-party provides to us such as your email address and name to help create your Game Account.
Further information about use of third-party accounts is provided in the Privacy Policy at https://wildlifestudios.com/privacy-policy.</li>

Prior to making a Transaction, you should make sure you fully understand the agreement that covers your Transaction, whether that agreement is an App Store Agreement or another payment platform agreement (like a third-party payment processor’s terms).
There may be limits to the quantity and number of times you can purchase Virtual Goods, Game Currency, or other aspects of your Transaction.
For example, there may be a maximum amount of Game Currency you are able to hold (in-Game) or purchase at a given time, or a maximum number of Transactions you may make per day.

We may cancel, revoke, or otherwise prevent the use of Virtual Good or Game Currency if we suspect any unauthorized or fraudulent activity, and/or to correct any erroneous application of any Virtual Goods or Game Currency to your Account.</p>

Subscriptions, if offered, give full access to all the Subscription features as long as Subscription is active.
If you purchase a Subscription, you must ensure all the information that you submit is true and accurate (including, without limitation, your credit/debit card number and expiration date, and other payment details) and that you have appropriate parental or guardian consent if you are under 18 years of age.
You agree to pay all Subscription fees specified when you apply including all applicable taxes.
If you choose a recurring Subscription for a Game, you acknowledge that payments will be processed automatically (e.g., charged to your credit card) until you cancel the Subscription or your Game Account.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Free Trial</u>.
From time to time, Wildlife may offer a free trial for a Subscription.
You may need to opt-into a Subscription in order to access it during the trial period.
If so, and subject to applicable law, you will have the right to opt-out at any time during the trial period until at least 24 hours prior to the end of the trial period and you will be automatically charged after the trial period unless you opt-out at least 24 hours prior to the end of your trial period.
Additional terms and conditions may apply with respect to free trials which will be communicated to you by Wildlife.</p>

and (ii) we may revoke your license to such Games, Virtual Goods and/or Game Currency at any time consistent with these Terms without notice or liability to you.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries, states, provinces or other jurisdictions provide a statutory right to withdraw from an agreement to purchase digital content within a defined cancellation or ‘cooling-off’ period.&nbsp;By using any Games, Virtual Goods and/or Game Currency during this cancellation period, you hereby waive any statutory right you may have to withdraw from your agreement to purchase the applicable Game, Virtual and/or Game Currency and you agree that you will therefore not be eligible to receive a refund (or any alternative remedy) in relation to such Game, Virtual Good and/or Game Currency.
Where applicable law does not permit you to waive your right to so withdraw, you hereby agree that such withdrawal right expires immediately upon use of your Game, Virtual Good and/or Game Currency, as permitted by applicable law.</p>9.
