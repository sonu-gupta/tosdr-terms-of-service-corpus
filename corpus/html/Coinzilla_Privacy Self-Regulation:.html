</li>

<p>
The legal basis for collecting and using the personal Information of European Economic Area Customers, Site Visitors, or Users (denoted in this Section 4.6 as "EEA Data") will vary according to the type of personal Information collected and the specific circumstance in which the collection took place.
</p>
<p>
We will only collect Information from you for the following purposes: (i) when we have your consent.
(ii) to establish a contractual agreement with you.
(iii) when processing is in our legitimate interest and this does not come into conflict with your data rights, interests, and liberties.
We may be legally required to collect personal Information from you in certain cases or may need the personal data to ensure the protection of your own or another individual's personal interests.
</p>
<p>
In case of a legal requirement or establishing a contract with you, we will clearly state, at the right time, when and if it is compulsory for you to provide us with your personal Information (you will also be informed of the possible consequences of refusing to supply the required personal Information).
The same applies should we require to collect and use your personal Information for our own legitimate interests (or any of our third parties), as we will explain to you, in due time, what these specific interests are.
</p>
<p>
Should you have additional questions or require further information regarding the legal basis on which your personal Information is processed and used, and to have a better understanding of how our legitimate data processing interest affects your data protection rights and freedoms, please reach out to us by filling our contact form.
