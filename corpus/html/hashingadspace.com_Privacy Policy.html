INTRODUCTION <p>Thank you for your interest in Hashing Ad Space and its products.
We are committed to respecting your privacy and personal data and to protecting them.
The current privacy policy outlines the ways in which we protect the personal data we collect following your use of our services.</p> 2.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION <p>The goal of this privacy policy is to inform you on how Hashing Ad Space collects and processes your personal data as you use our services.
Our website is intended only for persons of over 18 years old (or other age of legal consent, in applicable jurisdictions).
It is important that you read this privacy policy together with any other privacy policy or fair processing policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data.
This privacy policy supplements other notices and privacy policies and is not intended to override them.</p>
<p>Hashing Ad Space is responsible for your personal data and its controller.
If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact admin@hashingadspace.com.
We take your privacy very seriously and are always interested in hearing your concerns.</p>
<p>In order to have a good working relationship, its very important that the personal data you supply to us is accurate and up-to-date.
This is why we ask you to update any personal data you supply to us in order to match your current situation.</p>
<p>Our website may feature links or ads to other websites, plugins and/or applications.
Hashing Ad Space is not responsible for the way those connections collect and/or share your personal data.
We strongly encourage you to read the privacy policy for every new website you visit.</p> 3.
PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT <p>We define personal data as any information about an individual which can be used to identify them.
Personal data does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
The types of data we may collect, make use of, store and/or transfer can be grouped in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity Data - first name, maiden name, last name, username, marital status, title, date of birth and gender</li>
<li>Contact Data - billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers</li>
<li>Transaction Data - details about payments to and from you and other details of products and/or services purchased from us.</li>
<li>Profile Data - username and password, purchases or orders you made, interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses.</li>

</ul>
<p>Hashing Ad Space may also collect, use and/or share Aggregated Data.
Aggregated Data is derived from your personal data and used for strictly statistical purposes.
By law, Aggregated Data is not considered personal data because it has been scrubbed of any information that can be used to identify you.
Aggregated Data helps us streamline our internal processes, by allowing us to know, for example, how many users in a certain country use one of our services.
We would then use this Aggregated Data to offer better services to those particular clients.
In situations where Aggregated Data would be combined with your personal information in such a manner where it can be used to directly or indirectly identify you, we would treat the resulting data as personal data and subject it to our privacy procedures.</p>
<p>Hashing Ad Space does not collect Special Categories or Personal Data (details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data), nor does it collect information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>

WAYS WE COLLECT PERSONAL DATA <p>We collect your personal data through your personal interaction with our website ie: when you create an account and start trading with it.
The data we collect can be data that is voluntarily submitted by you (name, address, email address) or data that is collected automatically by our systems (IP address, operating system and version, browser data and version).
This data is collected for the sole purpose of creating a better user experience for you.</p> 5.
WAYS WE USE PERSONAL DATA <p>We only process your data within the current legal framework.
In most situations, we will process your personal data when we need to sign a contract with you, when we need to comply with a legal obligation or when we will ask for your consent for forwarding your personal data to Hashing Ad Space third party partners for marketing and promotional offers.
Hashing Ad Space will always ask for your consent when forwarding your personal data to third parties.
You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time by contacting us.</p>
<p>If we ever need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent in compliance with the above rules and where this is required or permitted by law.</p> 6.
