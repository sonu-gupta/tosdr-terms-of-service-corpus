It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or, contractual, financial or legal requirements.</p> Cookies, Web Beacons, and Pixels Cookies <p>In addition to information collected automatically, we use cookies to support the internal functionality of the Websites.
Cookies, which are small pieces of information sent to your browser by a website that you visit, are used to track usage patterns, traffic trends and customer behavior, as well as to record other information from the Website.
When you register on the Websites, cookies also allow us to save information so that you will not have to re-enter it the next time you visit.
Many content adjustments and customer service improvements are made based on the data derived from cookies.
Some Smithsonian Websites use third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to place cookies and analyze the information collected by cookies in order to make the Smithsonian Websites more interesting and useful to you.
No personally identifiable information is collected.
Information that we collect from cookies will not be used to create profiles of individual users and only will be used in aggregate form.
The data is retained for as long as necessary to support the mission of the Smithsonian Websites.
You may set your browser to refuse cookies from any website that you visit.
If you so choose, you may still gain access to most of the Smithsonian’s Websites, but you may not be able to conduct certain types of transactions (such as shopping) or take advantage of some of the interactive elements offered.
You may opt-out of Google Analytics using the&nbsp;Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>
<p>Additionally, some Smithsonian Websites may use the Demographics and Interest reporting feature for Google Analytics for Display Advertising.
The data provided by this service (such as age, gender, and interests) is used to better understand visitors to these Websites and customize our Websites to our users’ interest.
You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising by visiting&nbsp;Ad Settings.</p> Web Beacons and Pixels <p>The Smithsonian also collects non-personally identifiable information through the use of tracking pixels that appear on our pages.
A tracking pixel is a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows us to collect information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel.</p>
<p>We use tracking pixels to trigger ads on participating websites based on activity tracked from the browser on a device used to visit Smithsonian Websites.
We also use them to tell when an advertisement we run on another website has been clicked on by Smithsonian Website visitors, and use that information to judge which advertisements are more appealing to users.</p>
<p>To opt out of these tracking pixels and services, please follow this link to opt out of the Google Analytics-based tools (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/), the Facebook Pixel (https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads), and the Bing Pixel (https://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out).</p> Children and Privacy <p>The Smithsonian’s Websites are intended to be accessible and enjoyed by general audiences.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13, without first providing the parent or legal guardian with notice and obtaining prior verifiable consent.
If a visitor known to be a child sends an email to the Smithsonian, we will only use it to respond to the writer and not to create profiles or otherwise retain the information.&nbsp.
Where a Smithsonian Website is specifically directed toward children under the age of 13, the terms of the Smithsonian’s Kids Online Privacy (“SKOP”) Statement will apply and the Website will include a link to the SKOP.&nbsp.
If a parent or guardian believes their child’s personally identifiable information was inadvertently collected, please contact SmithsonianPrivacyOffice@si.edu.&nbsp;&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p> Security <p>The Smithsonian takes reasonable steps to design and manage our Websites’ technology to ensure that its information technology systems, applications, and information technology infrastructure are secure.
When you use your credit card for any purchase or donation on a Smithsonian Website, that transaction is encrypted using “Transport Layer Security (TLS)” encryption to protect your credit card information when traveling over the Internet.
Further, we require credit card processing be secured based on compliance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards.</p> Linking <p>Within the Smithsonian’s Websites are embedded applications, plug-ins, widgets, and other content links to non-Smithsonian websites.
These sites operate independently of the Smithsonian and have their own privacy policies.
The Smithsonian is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of non-Smithsonian websites, and such link is not intended to be an endorsement of the non-Smithsonian website or its content.
For your protection, you should review the privacy policy of the site you linked to from our website.</p> Contact Us <p>Questions and comments about this Privacy Statement may be directed to us via mail at Smithsonian Privacy Office, 1000 Jefferson Drive, SW, Washington, DC 20013 or email at SmithsonianPrivacyOffice@si.edu.
The Smithsonian Institution is a large organization with many people sharing responsibility for the content of its Websites.
