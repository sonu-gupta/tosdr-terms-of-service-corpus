<strong>Social Media</strong>
<br> If you log into your account with any of our brands through a social media site, we will also have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and profile photo, in accordance with the site’s account verification procedures.
Also, if you interact with content on our social media profiles (for example, if you “like” or share a post from one of our brand’s Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram accounts), those social media sites may share information about you with us, including your public profile, e-mail address and friend list.
If you choose to “like” or share content, information about you may be publicly displayed on the social network, depending on your privacy settings.
You should review the Privacy Notice of that social media site and check your privacy settings through that site.
If you post information on a social media or another third-party service that references our brands or our products and services (e.g., via a Twitter hashtag), we may publish your post on our social media accounts or websites.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information You Provide About Others</strong>
<br> The content you choose to upload to our service, including your photos and the information you store in your address book, may include personal information of others.
If you choose to share your photographs or other information with someone else through a feature we offer, we will use the personal information you provide (for example, the e-mail address of the recipient) to fulfill your request and for other purposes described in this Privacy Notice.
Before you upload and/or share personal information of others through our service, please ensure that you have the consent of such persons to do so.</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Information Contained in Your Photos</strong>
<br>When you upload your photos to our platforms or give us permission to access the photos stored on your device, your photo content may also include related image information such as the time and the place your photo was taken, tags and similar information stored by your image capture device.
If you wish to restrict the transfer of image metadata in your individual photos, please adjust the settings on your image capture device.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
<br>We use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect your information when you are using our Services.
We use such information to analyze trends, remember user settings, administer our Services, track user movements, and market our products and services.
We may obtain reports based on the use of these technologies on an individual and/or aggregated basis.
You can control cookies through your browser setting and through tools we make available through our Services.
For more information about cookies and other tracking technologies we use, including how to disable them, please refer to our Cookie Notice.</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Sources</strong>
<br>We may also obtain data that is publicly available or from third party sources, such as address verification services or third-party marketing database partners, to improve the accuracy of and add to what we know about our customers and prospective customers.
We may combine this information with your personal information for the purposes described in this Notice.</p>
<p>

<br>In addition to information collected from our customers, we and our service providers also collect certain information from candidates who apply for a job with Snapfish to contact you about your application and evaluate your qualifications for the position, including your name, phone number, e-mail address, postal address, education information, and employment information.</p>
<p>
<strong>How do we share your information with third parties?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>We do not sell, license or share the personal information we collect with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes.</strong>
</p>
<p>We may share personal information in the following situations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Service Providers</strong>
<br>We sometimes use third-party service providers to act on our behalf, for example to help us fulfill your product orders, process payments, enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, or to deliver our advertisements.
Our service providers may receive your name and contact information, payment information, photos and other content you upload to our Sites and Apps, information about purchases you’ve made, cookies and other device identifiers, IP address, and website browsing and interaction activity.
These service providers are only allowed to use your information in connection with the specific service they provide on our behalf.</p>
<p>
<strong>Partners and Affiliates</strong>
<br>Snapfish is part of the Shutterfly family of companies and brands.
We may share your information among our corporate affiliates and subsidiaries for purposes described in this Notice.
This allows us to offer features such as the ability to use your Snapfish account credentials across all of our Web properties and applications where available.
We also work with third parties who act as our partners to offer you joint products and services – for example, we work with prominent retailers to offer ship-to-store options to customers in many locations.
If you decide to use such products or services, we will share certain information about you with our partners for use as needed to enable us to provide the service.</p>
<p>
<strong>Law Enforcement, Mergers, and Other Situations</strong>
<br>We may be required to share your personal information in other, limited circumstances.
For example, we may be required to share certain information to respond to a subpoena or similar judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies.
Additionally, your information may be transferred to another organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of the Sites and Apps because we have merged with or have been acquired by another organization, or if we liquidate our assets.
In those cases, the new company’s use of your information will still be subject to this Notice and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p>
<p>
<strong>Does our website collect information from children?</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Sites and Apps are intended for use by general audiences and are not targeted directly at children.
We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information through our websites or apps, we will remove their personally identifiable information from our files.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided such information through our websites or apps, the parent or guardian should contact us in writing at privacy@snapfish.com so that we may respond appropriately.</p>
<p>
<strong>What options do you have to limit our collection and use of your personal information?</strong>
</p>
<p>You have choices about how your information is collected and used.
You can notify us of your preferences when you create an account with us, and if you would like to review, correct or delete your account information on our Sites and Apps, you can do so by logging in to your account or by contacting us directly.
There may be times when we are unable to fulfill your request – for example, if providing access to your personal information would reveal confidential commercial or proprietary information or personal information about someone else (and we cannot separate your data), if we are prohibited by law from disclosing the information, or if we have a legal obligation to retain certain data.
We may require additional personal information from you for the purposes of verifying your identity and rights.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the services we provide, such as service announcements and administrative messages (for example, communications related to a pending order, an unresolved customer service issue, or a Notice update).

<p>
<strong>How do we keep your information secure?</strong>
</p>
<p>Although no website, application, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof,” we have safeguards in place to protect against unauthorized access and disclosures of the personal information we control, including technical, physical and administrative safeguards and security measures.
Despite these measures, however, we cannot guarantee that our information security safeguards will never be compromised.</p>
<p>
<strong>How do we make updates to this Notice?</strong>
