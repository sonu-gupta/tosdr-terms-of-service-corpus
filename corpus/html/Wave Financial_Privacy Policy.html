We exist to support small business owners like you by offering a fast and easy way for you to manage your business finances.</p>

We sincerely hope this helps you better understand our privacy practices, and how we operate.

<strong>A.
SCOPE</strong>
<p>Our products and services are offered by Wave Financial Inc.
or by companies related by common ownership or control, including, Wave Financial USA Inc.
and Wave Money Inc., (collectively, “Wave,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>waveapps.com and its subdomains (the “Site”);</li>
<li>our mobile apps that incorporate this privacy policy.
and</li>
<li>products and services branded with the Wave name.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>Policies like these aren’t always the easiest to understand (or fun to read).
We’ll do our best to make the legal language make sense on this side.
The stuff along the left is what you’re agreeing to.</p>
<p>This privacy policy does not apply to products or services offered on or through our Site or services by our Business Partners, third-party websites, or our affiliate H&amp;R Block, (“Business Partners”), which have their own policies.
You should carefully read the privacy policies and any terms and conditions applicable to such Business Partners.
When you request products or services from such Business Partners, you give us permission to provide these companies with information about you necessary to fulfill or process your request.</p>In simple Terms<p>Sometimes, we work with other companies and organizations to bring our customers an unbeatable experience.
When this happens, their privacy policies apply and they’ll have access to some of your information, but only as much as is absolutely necessary to provide the service you want.</p>
<p>
<strong>Special Note to Parents: </strong>Because of the nature of the services we provide, we do not market our services to children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.<br>
</p>
<p>“Personal Information,” means information about an identifiable individual.
That’s what this policy is about – our collection, protection, use, retention, disclosure and other processing of Personal Information and your rights relating to these activities Specifically, we collect the following categories of personal information:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact Information (e.g., name, phone number, address, and email address);</li>
<li>Social Insurance Number or Social Security Number, and other government identification numbers (e.g., Driver’s License Number);</li>
<li>Financial Information (e.g., income, revenue, assets, credits, deductions, expenses, and bank account information);</li>
<li>Date of Birth;</li>
<li>Payment Data (e.g., checking, debit and credit card account numbers, balances and payment history);</li>
<li>Health Information (e.g., health insurance status and financial information related to payment for healthcare services);</li>
<li>Geo-Location Information;</li>
<li>Website, Mobile Application, and Email Usage Data (e.g., interactions with a website, application or advertisement);</li>
<li>Device Information (e.g., internet protocol (IP) address, device type, unique identifier, app version, operating system, network data, and phone state);</li>
<li>Login Information;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Demographic Information;</li>
<li>Professional or employment-related information.
and</li>
<li>Education information.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>We treat your personal information with the same respect we want our own to be treated with—and when you deal with finances like we do, there’s a lot of personal information involved.
Here’s a list of exactly what we collect.</p>
<p>We also compile certain aggregate or anonymized data about our users.
What is aggregate data? “Tim Smith buys a coffee at a coffee shop on Main Street” is the Personal Information of Tim Smith, but “20% of Wave users buy coffee on Tuesdays” is aggregate data.
We may use and disclose aggregated or anonymized information in our public statements and to identify individuals that may be interested in our Services.</p>In simple Terms<p>Understanding our customers is a huge part of building better experiences.
To do this, we may look at and share customer data in summarized and anonymous forms, but rest assured, when we do, we cannot identify you or any customer personally.</p>
<p>We use Personal Information to provide you and your business with the services.
Our Privacy Policy is based on the following ten fair information principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Identifying purposes</li>
<li>Consent</li>
<li>Limiting collection</li>
<li>Limiting use, disclosure, and retention</li>
<li>Accuracy</li>
<li>Safeguards</li>
<li>Openness</li>
<li>Individual access</li>
<li>Challenging compliance</li>
</ol>In simple Terms<p>The government provides these 10 principles on collecting, storing, and using personal information.
By following this list, we cover all our bases so you can rest easy knowing your personal information is safe.</p>
<strong>1.
Accountability and Challenging compliance</strong>
<br>
<br>
<p>Wave has named a Privacy Officer who is responsible for all things privacy at Wave.
This includes our policies and procedures that are designed to keep your information safe.
If you have any questions about our privacy practices or this policy, you can contact us at:</p>
<p>Wave Financial Inc.<br>Privacy Officer<br>235 Carlaw Ave, Suite 501 Toronto, ON M4M 2S1 Canada<br>Email: privacy@waveapps.com</p>
<p>
<br>If you’re not satisfied with our response, you have the option of contacting the Office of Canada’s Privacy Commissioner of Canada.</p>In simple Terms<p>If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, we have someone to listen and help.
Here’s how you can get in touch with that person.</p>
<strong>2.
Identifying Purposes</strong>
<p>Wave collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise manages Personal Information in a variety of ways related to our Site and the services we provide.
We’ve outlined these below.
Your use of the services determines which information we collect and use.
For example, payroll information is optional, unless you’d like to use Wave Payroll to run payrolls, at which point we will need to collect payroll information to provide you with this service.
Similarly, when you create an invoice, your customer’s email is optional, but if you’d like us to deliver the invoice by email, this information becomes necessary.</p>In simple Terms<p>Many Wave services and features simply wouldn’t work without some personal information.
Here’s why and how that information is collected, stored, and used.</p>
<p>Wave may collect, use, or store Personal Information for the purposes described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to provide you with the services you request, which may include the following:</li>
<li>We collect information directly from you when you use or interact with our Site or our services.
This Personal Information may relate to you, your employees, or individuals you interact with.</li>
<li>We may also collect information from third parties when you connect your Wave account to them.
These integrations may pull data into or share data out of Wave.
In some cases, we use a service provider to connect you to a third-party service (e.g., when you connect&nbsp.
a bank account to Wave).
When you connect your Wave account with a third-party service, their terms and policies apply.</li>
<li>We may also collect your name and email address from third parties when you sign up and login to our Site using single sign-on (SSO).</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>We sometimes connect with other service providers to deliver the best products and services.
When this happens, your information also falls under their terms and policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Site or services may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums.
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
To request removal of your Personal Information from our blog or community forum, you may contact us by emailing us at privacy@waveapps.com.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</li>
<li>To promote or offer you services, and to determine your eligibility for new products services we may offer from time to time.</li>
<li>To offer you products and services from our Business Partners.</li>
<li>To provide you with educational materials and guides relevant to the services you use.</li>
<li>To contact you for the purposes of Service updates and system and account notifications.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To provide you with support in connection with the services.</li>
<li>We collect information and usage data whenever you interact with us, whether online, through a mobile application, or through an email.
This data may include which websites you visit, what you click on, and when you performed those actions.
These activities may be performed by us or a service provider acting on our behalf.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>Personal Information would only appear in our blog or community if you posted it.
If you’ve posted on our site and want it removed, just let us know.
We can almost always remove it, and if not, we’ll let you know why.</p>
<strong>We do not sell your Personal Information to other companies.</strong>In simple Terms<p>We will not sell your details, ever.</p>
<strong>How we Disclose Information.</strong>
<br>
<p>We may disclose your information to other Wave companies, our affiliates, or to third parties with whom we have a written contract limiting the use and disclosure of your information.
We may share your information to support the products and services you request or provide you information on products and services that may benefit you.</p>In simple Terms<p>There are times when personal information does need to be disclosed.
You have the right to know about these situations, so we’ve listed them here.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wave Companies and Our Other Affiliates, including H&amp;R Block.</strong> We may provide information to companies related by common ownership or control.
These companies may use this information to support the products and services you request or market additional products and services to you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Business Partners.</strong> We work closely with a variety of business partners that are not Wave companies.
We may offer products jointly with our Business Partners.&nbsp.
We may share information that is related to such transactions with that Business Partners.
We require all Business Partners to have written agreements with us that require them to safeguard your information and prohibit them from selling, retaining, using or disclosing your personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the contract.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>Online products like Wave need to interact with other business partners in order to work properly.
When this involves sharing personal information, we’re vigilant about ensuring the information is managed securely and responsibly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal </li>
<li>information to third parties who provide services on our behalf.
We have written agreements with our service providers that require them to utilize appropriate physical, technical, and administrative controls to protect personal information and prevent them from using personal information for any purpose other than performing the service they provide.
For example, we may use service providers to host our website and to process payments.
Your Personal Information may be maintained and processed by these third parties in other jurisdictions.
We use service providers in Canada and the United States.
When your information is in another jurisdiction, it will be subject to their laws.
We only share the information these service providers need to perform the service and we don’t authorize them for any other use or disclosure of personal information.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>We also occasionally need to share personal information with service providers.
This is especially true for complicated tasks like transferring money electronically.
We take the same high level of caution, and ensure the information is used only for the purposes needed.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Persons Who Acquire Our Assets or Business.</strong> If we sell or transfer any of our business or assets (including insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings), certain information about our clients may be a part of that sale or transfer.
In the event such sale or transfer results in a material change to this privacy policy, we will notify you.
The notification procedure will be the same as the procedure we use to notify you of a change to this Privacy Notice&nbsp.
as described below.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>If the ownership of Wave changes, customer information may be included in the transfer of ownership.
Rest assured, we’ll let you know if that change causes material updates to these policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Responses to Legal Requests.</strong> We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is required or permitted by law pursuant to a legal request.
This may occur in connection with a court order, legal process, or other judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding that produces a request for information from us.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose your information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>When laws require us to share customer information with the proper authorities, we’re obligated to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Protection of Wave and Others.</strong> We may disclose your information when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect either your or our rights and safety.
We may disclose your information to federal, state, provincial, or local officials in order to, and only to the extent necessary, inform the official of activities that may constitute, or may have constituted, a violation of any criminal law or to assist the official in investigating or prosecuting a violation of criminal law.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>Like the point above, information may be shared with government authorities when legally required.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Aggregate Data.
</strong>We may disclose aggregate information compiled using information that does not identify you individually or personally.
This may include, for example, the total number of visitors from a particular geographic area or the average user age.</li>
</ul>In simple Terms<p>Some summarized, anonymous information may be shared publicly, but could never be connected to individual customers.</p>
<strong>3.
Consent</strong>
<strong>Submitting the Personal Information of Others</strong>
<p>When you submit the Personal Information of your customers or employees to us, you are responsible for informing such customers and employees about Wave, and for obtaining any necessary consent or authority from them, including informing them that Wave operates within Canada and utilizes service providers within the United States.
In addition, your Personal Information will be accessed by Wave employees outside of Canada and the US for business purposes.</p>
<p>You may also choose to refer someone to our Site or through one of our referral programs.
We may ask for that person’s name and contact information, including email address.
We will send them a single invitation email to the address you provide.
Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals or businesses with whom you have a relationship and who would want to receive the message.</p>
<strong>Closing your Wave Account</strong>
<p>At any time and without penalty, you can close your Wave account and stop using our services.
Please ensure you complete the account closure process which includes a confirmation email.
Otherwise, your account may not be closed.</p>In simple Terms<p>We’d be sad to see you go, but if you do, we won’t make closing your account a hassle.
Just don’t forget the confirmation email to make it official.</p>
<strong>Email and Communications Consent</strong>
<p>At any time, you can opt-out of commercial email communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in such emails, or via the Email Preferences settings in your account.
Certain non-commercial communications may still be sent to you that are required to provide you with our services.
For example, system notifications, major product changes, changes to our Terms of Use, or other news that we believe will materially affect how you interact with Wave.</p>
<p>The only way to completely stop all emails from Wave is to close your account as outlined above.</p>In simple Terms<p>We like to keep in touch, and promise we won’t overdo it.
Still, if you’d ever like to opt-out, we’ve made it easy.</p>
<p>Heads up: If you do opt out of our marketing emails, we may still send you important, non-marketing messages.</p>
<strong>4.
Limiting Collection</strong>
<p>Wave only collects the Personal Information necessary to provide the services to you.
The services you use will determine most of the information Wave collects.
We’ll also provide you the option of sharing additional information to enhance your Wave experience.</p>
<p>Wave may also use third-party services to supplement or enrich our understanding of our customers.
This includes cross-referencing information like a name, business name, email address or IP address in third-party databases and using the information there to improve our understanding of you and your business.</p>In simple Terms<p>We only collect the personal information we need to deliver the services you want.
What we collect depends on which services you use.</p>
<p>Some of the services allow you to provide access to your Wave account to other authorized users, which we call “guest collaborators”.
Guest collaborators have access to information in your Wave account, including Personal Information, and may perform various tasks on your behalf.
You take full responsibility for any collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information by your guest collaborator(s).</p>
<p>To provide access to your account to a guest collaborator, you must provide the guest collaborator’s name and email address.
We will send them a single email inviting them to the Site.
Wave only uses this information to invite your guest collaborator.
Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals or businesses that you have a relationship with and who would want to receive the message.
The guest collaborator may contact us at privacy@waveapps.com to request that we remove their name and email address from our database.
This will remove the guest collaborator’s ability to access to or perform tasks on your behalf in your Wave account.</p>In simple Terms<p>You can allow someone else to access and use your Wave account.
Be vigilant, as you are responsible for how that person uses the information they can access.</p>
<strong>5.
Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</strong>
<p>We will use and disclose your Personal Information as described in this policy.
Some Wave employees who have access to your Personal Information outside of Canada and the US.

<p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.
To be clear, that means we’ll retain your Personal Information while you have an active account, and afterward if we need to do so to meet our legal obligations.
If you choose to close your Wave account, we will destroy your Personal Information within 60 days unless we are otherwise legally obliged to keep it longer consistent with our retention policies or if we determine it is necessary to defend against legal claims.</p>In simple Terms<p>We take our responsibilities about using, disclosing, and storing your personal information seriously.
With rare legal exceptions, your information will be destroyed within 60 days of closing your account.</p>
<strong>6.
