The processed data is used to improve and correct the functionality of the service.</p> Access data/server log files <p>The provider (or its hosting provider) collects data about every access to the offer (so-called server log files).
Access data includes:</p>
<p>Name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.</p>
<p>The provider uses the protocol data only for statistical evaluations for the purpose of operation, security and optimisation of the offer.
However, the provider reserves the right to check the log data subsequently if there is a justified suspicion of illegal use based on concrete indications.</p> Contacting <p>When contacting the provider (e.
g.
by means of a contact form or e-mail) the user's details are stored for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the event that follow-up questions arise.</p> Comments and posts <p>If users leave comments in the blog or other posts, their IP addresses are stored.
This is done for the security of the provider, if someone writes illegal contents in comments and contributions (sworn, forbidden political propaganda, etc.).
In this case the provider can be prosecuted for the comment or contribution and is therefore interested in the identity of the author.</p> Integration of third-party services and content <p>It is possible that third-party content such as videos from YouTube, maps from Google Maps, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites may be included in this online offer.
This always presupposes that the providers of this content (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers") perceive the IP address of the users.
Without the IP address, they would not be able to send the content to the browser of the respective user.
The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content.
We make every effort to use only those contents whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the contents.
However, we have no influence if the third-party providers store the IP address for statistical purposes, for example.
