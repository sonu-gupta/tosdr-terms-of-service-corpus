We retain your Personal Information for as long as your Service participation is active (as determined by us) and for a reasonable time thereafter (in the event that you choose to engage with us again).
We also may retain your Personal Information for a longer period of time as needed to provide you services or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.
