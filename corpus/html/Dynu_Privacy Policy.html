<em> "We have been using Dynu email hosting for years now and have never had an issue so far.
<br>
<br> Multi-protocol, multi-platform, nice webmail interface, extensively customizable, excellent credentials management, there is nothing bad to say about it.
<br> With its very affordable price and its strong user community you really can't go wrong." </em>

<em> "I've been using Dynu hostnames as my day-to-day Remote Desktop sessions for a long time, and I'm very happy with it.
<br>
<br> The IP Update Client for Windows can run as a System service, so I do not even need to keep my Windows account logged in.
Dynu rocks!" </em>

<em> "Many of our customers' ISP blocks port 25 so they have not been able to host email server on premise.
<br> Dynu email store/forward service literally saved the day! <br>
<br> We looked at some other providers but Dynu is so far the most stable and affordable one can find.
I recommend Dynu to every customer I have." </em>
