<br>Control Tower DNS<p>PrivadoVPN offers a smart DNS service (“Control Tower”) to users that want to block ads &amp.
trackers, block IP level threats, and bypass geo-restrictions without the need to install a VPN client.</p>
<p>Control Tower requires a customer to register an IP address as it operates only at the DNS layer and needs to apply the correct rules to match a user query to your profile.
A user registers an IP address by using the “Control Tower” page on the PrivadoVPN website.</p>
<p>IP addresses registered with Control Tower are only used to identify authorized devices and not used for any other purpose.
Control Tower does not keep logs of which proxy server IPs are used by a user and we do not have access to this data.
We do not have any way to link any online activity to any individual account.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please Note:</strong> The PrivadoVPN client allows a user to take advantage of Control Tower without registering an IP address.
The PrivadoVPN client works in conjunction with Control Tower to apply a user’s DNS rules while eliminating the need to register and IP Address.</p>
