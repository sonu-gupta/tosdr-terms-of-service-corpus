<b>4.&nbsp.
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</b>
</p>
<p>Subscriber represents and warrants to ACG and ACG’s licensors that: (a) Subscriber has read and understood these Feature Terms.
(b) Subscriber has, and any individual accepting on behalf of Subscriber has, full right and authority to accept these Feature Terms on behalf of Subscriber and to bind Subscriber to these Feature Terms.

</p>
<p>ACG reserves the right to, in ACG’s sole discretion, take any action to: (a) investigate, prevent, mitigate, or remediate any violations or suspected violations of these Feature Terms.
(b) maintain or restore the security of the Features or the Services.
and/or (c) comply with ACG’s obligations under the Cloud Provider Terms.
These actions may include but are not limited to: (i) editing or removing the applicable Interactive Content or portion thereof.

<b>6.&nbsp.
FEATURE CHANGES</b>
</p>
<p>The Features are currently provided as an add-on feature in connection with Subscriber’s subscription to the Services.

and ACG may change, modify, suspend, or terminate all or part of the Features at any time.
For example, and without limiting ACG’s general rights, each Cloud Provider may have the right to change, modify, suspend, terminate, or take other action with respect to its Cloud Platform or ACG’s use of its Cloud Platform, in accordance with the Cloud Provider Terms (a “<b>Cloud Platform Change</b>”).
and in the event of such a Cloud Platform Change, ACG will have the right to take action with respect to the Features commensurate with the Cloud Platform Change.
The Section will control over anything to the contrary in Subscriber’s Agreement.</p>
