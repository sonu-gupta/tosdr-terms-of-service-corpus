<p>Per applicable data protection laws, you may be presented with the option to agree to the use of certain cookies prior to browsing CrowdStrike’s website.
In doing so, you can consent to allow all cookies, consent only to specific categories of cookies, or reject the use of cookies except for those deemed necessary for the website or otherwise designed in a manner that is permissible under applicable law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>What is a Cookie?<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer to remember your webpage actions or preferences over time.
Cookies don’t read or modify data on the user’s computer.
Cookies help provide a user with a better and faster online experience.
When you visit a website for the first time, your internet browser will download and place cookies on your device.
The next time you access the same website from the same device, the website will recognize that you have visited before, and in some cases adapt the content to your prior visits.
This allows the website experience to be tailored to your personal interests and preferences.</p>
<p>A web beacon is a small graphic file that is placed on the web page the user visits and is often used to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data.</p>

<p>
<strong>To help us improve our Websites and Web Portals:&nbsp;</strong>Cookies help us improve our website and web portals by analyzing how visitors interact with them.
We use that information to determine what is popular and what else visitors may find useful.
That information allows us to understand how visitors use our website to make them better and enhance the web experience, and to display content most relevant to individual users.</p>
<p>
<strong>To customize a user’s web experience on our Websites and Web Portals:&nbsp;</strong>Cookies also help us understand how you use and interact with our websites and web portals.
