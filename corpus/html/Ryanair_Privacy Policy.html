<p>
<b>Health Information</b>
</p>
<p>Personal details about your physical or mental health are considered “special categories of personal data” under the GDPR and applicable data protection laws.
We will only process such data where you&nbsp;have given your explicit consent (for example, where you request special assistance before or during a flight, we will need to provide this information to our staff or our service providers at those airports to and from which you will be flying so they can provide the assistance you have requested),&nbsp.
or where it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of other people (for instance, if you request special assistance), or where you have deliberately made this information public.
The processing of such personal data, including Covid-19 Data (as defined above), may also be necessary for compliance with public health legislation, regulatory requirements or other entry requirements in your destination/s.&nbsp.
Some of these requirements apply directly to you as a passenger and some apply to Ryanair and we are required to ensure (and may be required to demonstrate to our regulators, law enforcement and public health authorities) that these requirements have been complied with in the interests of public health.</p>
<p>When you upload Covid-19 Data during online check-in, in relation to a single booking, you do so on a voluntary basis, in which case the documents will be deleted from your device 48 hours after your flight departure.
We will retain a copy for three years (unless you request that we erase the copy) solely for the purpose of demonstrating our compliance with public health travel requirements as airlines are subject to heavy fines for allowing passengers without valid vaccine certificates and/or test certificates and/or locator forms to board their flight.
In addition to the above you can also choose to upload your Digital Covid Cert to your mobile phone during online check-in, in which case it will be saved for future bookings on your mobile phone, and you may remove this document at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have a specific medical condition, you need to inform us of that and in some instances provide us with a medical certificate.
This is for your safety and the safety of other passengers.
Our General Terms &amp.
Conditions of Carriage provide more detail on what medical information you need to disclose to us.</p>
<p>Where you apply for a refund on the basis of you or someone on your booking becoming seriously ill and unable to travel, we will require you to provide suitable evidence in accordance with our General Terms &amp.
Conditions of Carriage.&nbsp;</p> What we use your personal data for <p>In most cases we will need to process your personal data so we can process your booking, enter into our contract of carriage and perform that contract with you.</p>
<p>We have described below these purposes and all the other purposes your data may be used for.
We will only process your data for these stated purposes.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Booking Data is archived 18 months from the date of the flight, once there are no outstanding refunds or money due.
In general, most Booking Data is deleted 7 years after the date of the flight.
Once this information is archived all payment and travel document information is obscured.
Only limited roles within Ryanair have access to this archived data which is stored in order to create summarised models of data and in some instances data to respond to legal claims.</p>
<p>For myRyanair accounts, inactive accounts are generally closed 3 years after the last flight was flown.
You can make an erasure request at any time by submitting your request&nbsp;through our dedicated web-form (see ‘Your data protection rights’ section).
Once you exercise your right to erasure your myRyanair account will be closed and any data associated with any companion will be deleted.
However, a copy of the Booking Data will be retained in our systems as described above.
You can change the personal data in your myRyanair account directly in the account.
Any changes made by you will only apply to bookings made after these changes were made and will not alter existing bookings.</p>
<p>We process data subject requests using a specialised data protection tool provided by &nbsp;OneTrust.
Access to this system is restricted to a limited number of roles in Ryanair and data held in OneTrust is encrypted.
We separately keep a log of erasure requests made through our online form, for one year.</p>
<p>We use a third party tool called Zendesk to manage customer service interactions, including complaints, chats, refund requests, EU261 claims, serious illness claims and mishandled baggage claims.
This data is retained for a period that reflects the statute of limitations period for contract claims which is at most 10 years.</p> Security of your personal data <p>We are committed to ensuring the security and confidentiality of your personal data.
Taking into account the nature of your personal data and the risks of processing, we have put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures as required by applicable legal provisions to ensure an appropriate level of security and to prevent any accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, intrusion of or unauthorized access to these data.</p>

Details of these rights and how to exercise them are set out below.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Request for erasure of your personal information (right to be forgotten).
</b>You may ask us to delete or remove personal data, where we have no legal basis to continue to process it.
This includes deletion of the myRyanair account linked to the email address provided and/or used in booking a flight.
However, we will retain the personal data that relates to a contract between you and Ryanair (flight booking) to perform the contract, defend or pursue our legal rights and meet our obligations towards regulatory or governmental authorities.</p>
<p>You can request erasure by clicking here.&nbsp.
This requires verification of your email address.
Please follow the instructions provided through the link.</p>
<p>Please note we will make every effort to erase data where this right has been exercised by you and we no longer have a legal basis for processing same but some personal data sets are impossible (or infeasible) to edit or remove (e.g., server backup or microfiche).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Object to processing.</b> You have the right to object to the use of your data for direct marketing purposes at any time through this form.
This will remove you from our marketing databases.
It requires verification of your email address.
Please follow the instructions provided through the link.&nbsp.
You may also request us to stop processing your personal data where we are doing so based on legitimate interests (e.g., address personalized offers to you in the booking process) unless we require your data for dealing with legal claims or we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your rights.
If this is the basis for your objection, then click here&nbsp;for our online request form and set out in the comment area your basis for objection.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Request information.
</b>The section on ‘What personal data we collect’ sets out what personal data we collect and the section ‘What we use your personal data for’ sets out the reasons we collect it.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Request access </b>to the personal data we hold about you.
If you have a myRyanair account, you can view the personal data held in this account by logging into your account.
If you wish to access other personal data we hold about you other than what is in your myRyanair account, then you can use our webform available here.
You will need to provide a copy of your photo ID, either passport or national ID, when making your request so we can verify your identity.
We may not be able to provide you access to the data when it involves information relating to others who have not consented to the disclosure of their information.
We will also have to verify your email address before we can send the data to the email address provided in the request.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Request correction </b>of the personal information that we hold about you.
This can be done by you through your myRyanair account.
&nbsp;We have included tools in your myRyanair account, allowing you to directly change personal data you have provided there.</p>
<p>Please note that if you require changes in active bookings (i.e., where the flight has not yet taken place), you need to contact our Customer Services directly, as set out in our General Terms and Conditions of Carriage and FAQs.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Object to automated decision-making including profiling</b>, which produce a legal effect or similarly significant effects.
We do use personal data to personalize the services and offers you receive.
We also use automated processes to assist us in determining where additional in-person travel document checks are required.
We do not engage in automated processing with legal or similarly significant effects.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Request the restriction of processing </b>of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, but only in limited circumstances, which you must set out in the <u>comment section</u> of our webform.
Click here</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Request portability </b>of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”).
This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.
Click here</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Withdraw consent.</b> In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time.
In relation to marketing communications, this can be done as set out above under opt out / unsubscribe.
In your myRyanair account this can be done through your account by using the delete buttons provided where consent is the basis for our processing.
Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<b>Third parties.&nbsp;</b>If you are applying on behalf of another person then we require a signed letter of authority from the data subject in the form provided&nbsp;here.&nbsp.
If you are applying as a parent/guardian of children then we require the signed letter of authority provided&nbsp;here.&nbsp;In addition to the other requirements set out below, we will also verify the email of the data subject before processing such requests.&nbsp;If you wish to make a request on behalf of someone else, please use our third party&nbsp;webform, which allows for attachment of 1) required documents to allow us to validate the identity of the data subject and 2) the above signed letter of authority from the person making the request on behalf of a data subject.</p>
<p>We will respond to any request you make to exercise your rights within one month.
However, where required for complex or numerous requests, we may notify you (within the initial one month period) that a further period of up to two months is required in order to respond to the request.</p>
<p>These requests cannot be processed if made via email, due to their volume and the need to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p> Changes to Privacy Policy <p>We may make changes to this privacy policy at any time and if we make any material changes we will bring these changes to your attention.&nbsp;</p> Contact Us <p>If you have any further questions about this policy or how we handle your personal information, which are not dealt with here or through our webform or through your myRyanair account, please get in touch with us by writing to our Data Protection Officer at Ryanair Head Office, Airside Business Park, Swords, County Dublin, Ireland or emailing our DPO at DPO@ryanair.com.</p>
