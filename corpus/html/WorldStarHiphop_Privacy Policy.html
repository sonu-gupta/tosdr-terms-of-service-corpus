<li> With third parties offering goods and services for sale in our Services, who can receive your public information and additional information you provide them, including the information required to complete your transaction such as payment, shipping, and contact information.
</li>
<li> Aggregated, non-personally identifiable, de-identified information (i.e.
information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) may be shared with third parties that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us to optimize advertisers’ and other third-parties’ ability to reach their target audience and markets.
</li>
<li> With third party service providers helping us to enforce our policies if we suspect your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of MediaLab or others, including to investigate, remedy, or enforce our Terms of Service.
</li>
<li> With law enforcement, government agencies, or in response to legal requests if we have a good faith belief that disclosing the information is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request (e.g.
subpoenas, court orders, government audits, etc.).
This may include responding to requests from outside the US when we have a good faith belief a response is required and involves a user in that other jurisdiction.
</li>
<li> To help us detect or prevent fraud, which may include sharing device, usage, and other information we have about you.
</li>
<li> In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
</li>
<li> Between and among MediaLab, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership, as permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you among the various Services in order to provide you a more consistent and optimal experience and to enforce our policies.
</li>
<li> With your consent or at your direction.
</li>
</ul> THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND INTEGRATIONS <p> As noted above, our websites, webforms and mobile application will contain third-party content, links, and integrations.
For example, when you use our Services you may be presented with content and links to an advertiser's website to learn more about their products and services.
Through these integrations, you will be providing information to an advertiser, other third parties, as well as to us.
We are not responsible for how an advertiser and such other third parties collect or use your information.
As always, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit or use.
</p> HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION <p> How long we keep your information depends on the type of information, the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and other similar factors.

<ul>
<li> That you submit through our Services (like your name, phone number, address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.
</li>

</li>
<li> Indefinitely if it is aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified (i.e., not capable of identifying you).
</li>
<li> In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of time or as required by applicable law.
</li>
</ul>
<p> If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to delete your information (see “YOUR CHOICES” to learn more).
Keep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.
Also, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request to us.
This means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your use of our Services or your information is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.
</p> HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE <p> The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it.
For example, we have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification.
We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we anonymize or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide Services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser.
From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.
</p>
<p> Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect, impenetrable, or 100% secure.
We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner.
These are the risks of being online and conducting business online.
</p>
<p> Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
We may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs.
Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing.
If you have any questions about the security of your information, please contact us at: privacy@medialab.la.

<p> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking technologies.
To opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies.
Keep in mind that not all devices and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies on one browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices and may change at any time.
Opting out of cookies and other tracking technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have not opted out from displaying customized advertising.
In addition, opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you.
You will need to make these choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services.
</p>
<p> When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an opt-out cookie is placed on your device.
Then when you visit the same Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out.
This means that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services, including preventing your consent choices from being stored.
As a result, we may not know about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out.
We encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your particular device or browser to learn how to manage cookies and other tracking technologies.

Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
</p>
<p> To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the “ Do Not Sell My Personal Information” Section of our website.

</p> VISITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES <p> This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our Services from residents of the United States.
The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
Where permitted by applicable law, we may transfer the personal data we collect about you to other jurisdictions other than where you reside that may not be deemed to provide the same level of data protection as your home country for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

</p> EU Visitors <p> If you are an EU citizen or UK citizen, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the UK-GDPR (collectively, the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.
For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.
We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.
Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users in connection with our provision of certain Services, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data.

The four bases upon which we rely include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Contract.</b> This means we need the information to perform our contracted Services with you.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Legitimate Interests.</b> This means we have a legitimate interest that does not outweigh your privacy rights.
When we collect and process information based on our legitimate interests, we consider how we can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least obtrusive on your privacy.
For example, it is in our interest to protect your safety and security in the Services, so we collect and use information that has been flagged by users or requested by law enforcement.
to make sure you are satisfied with how the services work, troubleshoot technical problems or develop new features, we collect and use information about how you and others use the services and to respond to your service inquiries, we collect and use information in that request and, if relevant to the inquiry, information about how you access and use the services.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Legal Obligation.</b> We may need to use your personal information to comply with a law enforcement preservation request, subpoena, or other legal process or to protect the rights of other users.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Consent.</b> If we have no other legal basis for collecting or using your information, we will ask you for consent for a specific purpose.
If we do, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not apply to any processing conducted in reliance on lawful processing bases other than consent.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> In addition to other rights detailed in the policy (such as requesting deletion, correction or updating of your personal information), EU and UK citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Right to Object or Restrict Processing.</b> You have the right to object to or restrict our use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes or under certain circumstances when the legal bases for using your information is based upon our legitimate interest.

We may also retain depersonalized information after deletion.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

We have implemented sufficient GDPR compliant procedures to secure the transfer of your personal data to the United States.
We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States.
