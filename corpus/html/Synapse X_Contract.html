LICENSING AND PRODUCT INFORMATION<ol>
<li>The Product in and of itself is an extensible Lua 5.1 programming engine crafted to be interoperable with third party software that similarly runs Lua or Lua-inspired scripting languages.
More specifically, the Product is software that aims to make use of third party application programming interfaces (APIs) to achieve full interoperability between the Product’s Lua scripting language and third party applications’ Lua scripting languages (or subsets thereof).
In accordance with the philosophy of the GNU Project, we believe that software should be free, free as in Freedom and not price, allowing its users to make use of software as they see fit, and this Product aims to increase the relative liberty and accessibility of Lua scripting engines commonly found in software as a way to practice the philosophy of the GNU Project.
Interoperability and compatibility is however not guaranteed, as our Product is not necessarily compatible with all third party software.
This interoperability, and therefore the nature of this software, is legally protected in the United States by Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (17 USC § 1201 (f)).</li>
<li>This license serves as an unlimited contract between you, the Client, and Synapse Softworks LLC.
By purchasing a copy of the Product, you implicitly agree to all the conditions, clauses and other information offered by this document, &nbsp;vow to respect it, and uphold the personal responsibility of regularly consulting this document for any changes that may impact your usage of the Product and your behavior towards it.
You also affirm that you are aged 13 years or older, as this product is not recommended to individuals under the age of 13.
</li>
<li>Regulation of licensing, such as the granting or dismissing of licenses, is the responsibility of both Synapse Softworks LLC and its community managers (the staff).
Compliance with either group’s orders is highly recommended if you happen to breach the terms of conditions of this contract, as it may save your license.
These two groups will hereafter be named the Licensing managers.</li>
<li>Breaching the terms and conditions of this license will inevitably result in the immediate termination of the contract and therefore the ceasing of your personal usage of the Product, unless the Licensing managers grants you leniency.</li>
<li>Licensing managers have the right to revoke your contract at will and without warning.
Licensing managers are expected to issue dismissals with justification found in the terms and conditions, unless in extraordinary circumstances.
However, in case you judge your contract dismissal to be unfair, you may appeal your dismissal to Licensing managers and seek a possible reversal.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Unless specifically forbidden by Licensing managers, it is in your right to repurchase a license if it has been previously terminated in most cases.
However, it is a Licensing manager’s right to decide to revoke a newly purchased license for offenses committed under a previous license if they have been severe enough or are repeated under the new license.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Licenses are not individually transferable, and any attempt to force an illegal transfer whether of its commerciality is forbidden.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Licenses may be shared between individuals of the same household and/or between individual devices connected on the same network.
For example, family members living in the same domicile may share a copy of the Product insofar they are not sharing it to anyone not connected to their home network.</li>
<li>The household-share rule does not apply to non-residential networks.
For example, you cannot share a single copy of the product to individuals connected to a business/commercial network.</li>
<li>If the Licensing managers doubt the legitimacy of your sharing, they have the right to investigate your sharing of the Product and revoke your license if it is deemed unauthorized under the Terms of Service.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Licenses are not resellable, and any attempt to illegitimately resell a license will be considered an illegal transfer as defined by section 1.6.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>The only exception are Licenses transferred&nbsp;through authorized giveaways by Synapse Softworks LLC and its affiliates.
they are allowed to be sold.
Proof that the key originates from an authorized giveaway must be provided if administrators question the sale.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Licenses are to be considered irrevocably paid unless Synapse Softworks LLC decides that your condition warrants a partial refund.
There are no conditions for guaranteed refunds.</li>
<li>All claims and disputes arising under or relating to this License are to be settled by binding arbitration in a location mutually agreeable to the parties.
The arbitration shall be conducted on a confidential basis pursuant to the arbitration rules and guidelines of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.
Any decision or award as a result of any such arbitration proceeding shall be in writing and shall provide an explanation for all conclusions of law and fact and shall include the assessment of costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees.
Any such arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator experienced in computer science and software distribution and shall include a written record of the arbitration hearing.
The parties reserve the right to object to any individual who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization or entity.
An award of arbitration may be confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Please bear in mind that as expressed by Amendment VII of the United States Constitution, if you were to bypass our arbitration clause as an American citizen, you do not have legal grounds to file a lawsuit for a civil trial as the total value of our products never exceed the amount of $20 American Dollars (USD).</li>

<li>Infringing the rules and guidelines detailed within the two aforementioned sections will result in restrictions of your permissions to participate in or otherwise access official communication channels.

The punishment necessary is up to the discretion of the Licensing managers.</li>
<li>You may appeal any punishment received for infringing the rules and guidelines detailed under Article 6 and Article 7 (“Communications”), but relief from moderation isn’t guaranteed no matter the circumstance or severity of the infringement.
Such appeal must be in accordance with §5.4 and/or §5.4a in order to be considered valid.</li>

Sub-section rules that have extra superscripts in addition to the main section superscript(s) are considered to have said superscripts as possible additional&nbsp;punishment.
However, in accordance with Article §6.2, Licensing managers reserve the right to bestow any additional punishment at their discretion.

</ol>
<p>
</p>7.
COMMUNICATIONS<ol>
<li>Freedom to voice your opinions and speak your mind is considered the golden rule of the Synapse X community and is what sets it apart from many other communities.
This means that you will not be punished for having an opinion that is ‘unpopular’, ‘controversial’ or ‘politically incorrect’.

<li>Further violations of §7.3.2 will result in you being banned from the server.5</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>The usage of bots, including self-bots or plugins that simulate the usage of self-bots (e.g.
automation of Discord features), is not permitted.
This may get you banned from the server and possibly from the platform altogether.5</li>

how ‘public’ the number is [which will be handled on a case-by-case&nbsp;basis]), address, etc.

This does not count if they're obviously fake, like 127.0.0.1 or 8.8.8.8.1, 5</li>
<li>Do not post content that could trigger epileptic seizures or render someone with a mental illness (such as, but not limited to, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) uncomfortable.
