This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes our collection, use, and disclosure of the following categories of information:</p>
<p>
<strong>Information that we process as a “controller” (“Customer Data”).
</strong>Our Sites and Services are designed for businesses and their representatives.
We do not offer our Sites and Services for use by individuals for their personal, family or household purposes.
Accordingly, we treat all personal information we collect from Customers as pertaining to individuals in their capacities as business representatives and not their individual capacities.&nbsp.

By using our Sites or Services, you agree to our processing of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.<strong>

<strong>Information that we process as a “processor” (“Service Data”).
</strong>If you are a visitor to or user of a website, application, or service on which a Customer uses our Services (an “End-User”), then any information that we collect through our Services is subject to the Customer’s privacy policy and applicable terms.
When we provide our Services to a Customer, we process such data as a “data processor” for or on behalf of our Customer, and the Customer is considered the “data controller”.
If you are an End User of one of our Customer’s websites, applications, services, you should review that Customer’s privacy policy to learn more about that Customer’s privacy practices in relation to our Services, including its collection and use of your data, its legal bases for processing your data, its policies and options around marketing and its data retention policies.<strong>

Do-Not-Track Disclosure<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in certain web browsers.

EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield<br>
<p>Qualified complies with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the EEA, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States.
Qualified has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles and that it complies with the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program and to view our certification, please visit: https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
While Qualified is certified under the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks, we no longer rely on the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.&nbsp.
We also do not rely on the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the policy paper of the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of September 8, 2020.&nbsp.
If we transfer personal data to countries such that we are required to apply appropriate safeguards to your personal data under European data protection laws, we rely on alternative cross-border transfer mechanisms and safeguards.
Please contact us for further information about any such transfers or the specific safeguards applied using the contact details listed in Section 13, below.<br>
