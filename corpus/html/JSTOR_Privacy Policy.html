The Information ITHAKA Collects
<p>The personal information that ITHAKA collects will depend on how you are using ITHAKA Websites.</p>
<ul>
<li>To enable your access to the JSTOR, Artstor, and Portico services through your library or institution, we may collect information concerning the institution’s internet protocol address, your username and password, or other authentication methods, such as Shibboleth.</li>
<li>To facilitate your order through the Publisher Sales Service (a service through the JSTOR archive that facilitates the purchase of articles from publishers), JPASS, the Journals Hosting Program, and Individual Access, as well as your purchase of ITHAKA and its services’ brand merchandise, we may collect your name, postal address, email address and transactional information.
We collect but do not store your credit card details through a third party service provider.</li>
<li>In connection with your creation of a personal JSTOR account and/or a JSTOR Global Plants MyPLANTS (“MyPlants”) account, we collect your name, email address, username, and password, as well as other information you may provide.</li>
<li>In connection with your creation of an Artstor account, which is required to download images, save them to groups, create presentations and share them with other Artstor users, upload content to Personal Collections, and manage content in JSTOR Forum, we collect your email address, password, and institutional affiliation information.
however, as a general user, you can perform searches of and view the Artstor Digital Library collections, IAP collections, your institution’s hosted collections in JSTOR Forum, and images made more broadly available through JSTOR Forum without providing any further information.</li>
<li>To enable you to download images from the IAP service for publication purposes we collect and share with the institution providing the images for publication your name, email address, institutional affiliation, and other information you may provide.</li>
<li>In connection with a trial access request for Artstor Digital Library or JSTOR Forum, we collect your name, email address, phone number, institutional affiliation information, and other information you may provide.</li>
<li>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac), and the domain name of your Internet service provider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We may collect personal information through correspondence you send to us through optional surveys we may post on ITHAKA Websites, and in connection with statements you may post on any ITHAKA-related page on social networking sites.</li>
<li>In some instances, Ithaka S+R may be contracted to provide services to third parties, which may involve collecting your personal information.
In such cases, the privacy policy governing the collection of your personal information shall be as set forth in such third parties’ privacy policies.</li>
<li>If you choose to use an available function on JSTOR to send a link, citation list, or other information to another person, we will ask you for that person’s email address for processing purposes only and will send that person one e-mail with the relevant information.
ITHAKA will not store the recipient’s e-mail address once the one-time email has been sent.
If you do not have a personal JSTOR account, we will also ask for your e-mail address and likewise only use it one time for processing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, unless you provide us or organizations with which we conduct business with personal information, you remain anonymous to us other than by association with an internet protocol address or other authentication mechanism.
Please note we do not store the text submitted via copyright assessment tool on the Copyright Checkpoint website.</p>
<p>In the case of Artstor services, some institutions facilitate their users’ use of their digital resources by providing administrative support for such resources, such as helping set up users’ accounts, or removing materials that are no longer needed.
To provide such support, one or more representatives at an institution, such as a library administrator (“Institutional Administrator”), may need to associate electronic materials with the individual who created them, so that they can determine, for example, whether a particular user wants to continue to maintain such materials.
If you elect to register as a user of an Artstor website, you give ITHAKA permission to provide the Institutional Administrator the email address that was used to register with Artstor.
You also give the Institutional Administrator or ITHAKA (should the Institutional Administrator so direct us) permission to access the image groups or other materials that you have created, to make changes to such materials (including deleting such materials, either in full or in part), and to contact you at the email address provided with respect to such materials, for the purpose of administering and supporting the institution’s subscription to the Artstor services and websites.
Your permission to the Institutional Administrator and ITHAKA to perform these roles does not necessarily imply that these activities will be performed at your particular institution.
Please contact your Institutional Administrator if you have questions about institutional policy in this area.</p>
<p>ITHAKA does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16.
If it is discovered that we have collected PII from someone under 16 we promptly will delete that information.</p>
