<strong>Arbitration</strong>
<p>If you have a dispute with Flipboard for any reason, we’d like the opportunity to work out our differences informally.
We strongly encourage you to visit our Help Center, and we’ll do our best to resolve the dispute in good faith.
We’re reasonable people, really.
If we aren’t able to solve the problem that way, we both agree that we will resolve any claims arising from these Terms or the Flipboard service by final and binding arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration will take place in Palo Alto, California or another location we both agree upon.
Either of us may file a lawsuit in court solely for injunctive relief against the other to stop misuse of Flipboard or intellectual property infringement without first going through arbitration.
You agree to resolve any dispute you have with us on an individual basis in arbitration, and not as a class arbitration, class action or consolidated proceeding of any kind.</p>
<strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong>
<p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, except for its conflict of laws principles.
For claims that aren’t subject to arbitration, we each agree that any such claims shall be litigated exclusively in a state court located in Santa Clara County, California or in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>
<p>These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Flipboard.
If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue to be in full force and effect.
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<strong>Modification</strong>
<p>These Terms may be modified from time to time.
The date of the most recent revisions will always be at&nbsp;https://flipboard.com/terms, and older versions are available upon request.
If we make changes that we believe will substantially alter your rights, we will notify you by posting a notice on our website.
You agree to accept any changes or revisions to these Terms by continuing to use Flipboard.</p>
