</p>

SCOPE OF POLICY
</p>
<p>1.1.
Wolfprint 3D OÜ (“We”, “Us” and “Our”) is committed to protecting and respecting
</p>
<p>your privacy.
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) sets out the basis on which any
</p>
<p>personal data We collect from you, or that you provide to Us, will be processed by
</p>
<p>Us.
Please read the following carefully to understand Our views and practices
</p>
<p>regarding your personal data and how We will treat it.
</p>
<p>1.2.
This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Ready Player Me platform (“Platform”)
</p>
<p>and any of the services accessible through the Platform (“Services”), including the
</p>
<p>creation of the Avatar (“Avatar”).
</p>
<p>1.3.
Please take note that (depending on from where you access the Platform) the
</p>
<p>Platform may be framed into one of Our partners’ web applications (“Partner” and
</p>

This Privacy Policy applies only to your use of the Platform
</p>
<p>but not to usage of any of the services provided by the Partner (or any other third
</p>
<p>party) and not to usage of the Avatar outside the Platform.
</p>
<p>1.4.
Please also bear in mind that this Privacy Policy applies only if We collect personal
</p>
<p>data from you, i.e.
if you use your selfie for creating the Avatar or give Us your e-
mail address.
If you provide neither of those, We do not process your personal data
</p>
<p>and therefore this Privacy Policy does not apply.
</p>
<p>1.5.
This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above.
We have the right to
</p>
<p>unilaterally make amendments to this Privacy Policy.

</p>
<p>nor a requirement necessary to use the Services.

</p>
<p>4.
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA
</p>
<p>4.1.
We process your personal data because it is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract
</p>
<p>concluded between you and Us for providing you the Services (see clauses 3.1.a) and
</p>
<p>3.1.b)).
or for taking steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (see
</p>
<p>clause 3.1.b)).
In such a case the legal basis for processing data is the contract
</p>
<p>concluded between you and Us.
or you request prior to entering into a contract.
</p>
<p>4.2.
We also process your personal data to improve the Platform and the Avatar
</p>
<p>generation quality (see clause 3.1.c)).
In this case the legal ground for processing
</p>
<p>your personal data is your prior consent.
If you do not give Us your consent We will
</p>
<p>not process your personal data for that purpose.
You may at any time withdraw your
</p>Seite 3 von 5<p>3
</p>
<p>consent by sending a respective notice to Our e-mail at support@wolf3d.io.
</p>
<p>Withdrawal of consent does not affect your right to use the Services and the
</p>
<p>Platform.
</p>
<p>4.3.
Furthermore, We process your personal data (i.e.
use your e-mail address) for
</p>
<p>sending you information about updates to the Platform and to uses of the Avatar (see
</p>
<p>clause 3.1.d)).
But We do it only in the case where you have voluntarily given Us
</p>
<p>your e-mail address.
The legal basis for that is Our legitimate interest to keep you
</p>
<p>the in loop of any advancements which the Platform may get (e.g.
new customization
</p>
<p>options, etc.), any news about the Platform and any new use cases for the Avatar.
</p>
<p>You always have the possibility to unsubscribe from such e-mails by clicking on a link
</p>
<p>which is provided under each e-mail.
If you unsubscribe, We will no longer send you
</p>
<p>such e-mails.
</p>
<p>4.4.
We also process your personal data for enforcing and defending Our legal rights under
</p>
<p>legitimate interest pursued by Us (see clause 3.1.e)).
It is Our legitimate interest to
</p>
<p>enforce and defend Our legal rights as We see it necessary.
</p>
<p>4.5.
Also, We process personal data for complying with legal or regulatory obligations or
</p>
<p>requests (see clause 3.1.f)) as processing is necessary for compliance with the legal
</p>
<p>obligations to which We are subject to.
</p>
<p>5.

We will not disclose your personal data to third parties except for the following cases:

</p>
<p>Services, Inc.).
The standard contractual clauses established by the European
</p>
<p>Commission are applied to the transfer and processing of the personal data.
</p>
<p>b) Other group members.
We have the right to disclose your personal information
</p>
<p>to any member of Our group, which means Our subsidiaries and Our ultimate
</p>
<p>holding company and its subsidiaries.
Such transfer will only be done if it is
</p>
<p>necessary for the provision of the Services to You.
</p>
<p>c) Asset transfer parties.
In the event that We sell or buy any business or assets,
</p>
<p>in which case We will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or
</p>

</p>
<p>about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
</p>
<p>d) Legal authorities, institutions and other parties under law.
If We are under a
</p>
<p>duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal
</p>

</p>
<p>includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations
</p>
<p>for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p>
<p>5.2.
Where We do share your information with third parties, We will require such third
</p>
<p>parties to comply with this Privacy Policy and maintain appropriate security to protect
</p>
<p>your information from unauthorised access or processing, unless We have no ability
</p>
<p>to do so (for example, where We are sharing information with regulatory authorities
</p>
<p>or courts).
