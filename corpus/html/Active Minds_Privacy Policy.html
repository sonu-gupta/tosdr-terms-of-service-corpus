Disclosure of Your Information</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;We do not sell your Personal Information but we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties as described below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information to provide the Services, or when you authorize or instruct us to do so, for example when you use the Services to submit content or profile information.&nbsp.
The Services are a social experience, so we may disclose your interactions with the Services to social media platforms, as described in Section 2, above.<b>&nbsp.
</b>We may also disclose Personal Information and non-Personal Information to Service Providers.&nbsp.
By “Service Providers” we mean companies, agents, contractors, service providers, or others engaged to perform functions on our behalf (such as processing of payments, provision of data storage, hosting of our website, marketing of our products and services, and conducting audits).
&nbsp.
When we use a Service Provider, we require that the Service Provider use and disclose the Personal Information and non-Personal Information received from us only to provide their services to us or as required by applicable law.</p>
<p>We may also disclose Personal Information and non-Personal Information to Online Tool Providers.&nbsp.
By “Online Tool Provider” we mean a licensor of software that we include in, or use with, the Services, including an API or SDK, that provides a specialized function or service to us and that requires the transmission of Personal Information and/or non-Personal Information to the Online Tool Provider.&nbsp.
Online Tool Providers may have the right to use Personal Information and non-Personal Information about you for their own business purposes.&nbsp.
Use and disclosure of Personal Information and non-Personal Information by an Online Tool Provider is described in its privacy policy.&nbsp.
See Section 5 below for some of the key Online Tool Providers we use.</p>
<p>We may partner with advertisers to provide you with special offers, or to advertise products or services to you.&nbsp.
If you redeem or respond to an offer, we may provide your Personal Information to the advertising partner, including your name, email address, gender, and year of birth.
If you answer questions or fill out surveys from an advertiser, we may share information with that advertiser.
The advertising partner’s privacy policy will govern their use of your information, which may include marketing of other products or services to you.&nbsp.
You should read each advertiser’s privacy policy before providing information to that advertiser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information to third parties when we believe, in good faith and in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the Services, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (b) comply with legal or regulatory requirements or an enforceable governmental request, (c) protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or other third parties, (d) prevent a crime or protect national security, or (e) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we reserve the right to transfer information (including your Personal Information) to a third party in the event of a merger or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our operations relating to the Services to another non-profit organization, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of our operations.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of such transfer, for example via email or by posting notice on our website.</p>
<p>Lastly, we may also disclose non-Personal Information, aggregated with information about our other users, to our partners, grant providers, vendors,&nbsp.
and other third parties if we deem such disclosure, in our sole discretion, to have sound business reasons or justifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>5.
Cookies and Automatic Information Gathering Technologies</b>
</p>
<p>Every time you use the Services (e.g., access a Service webpage, navigate to a specific location within the Service mobile app), we collect Personal Information and non-Personal Information (discussed above in Section 2) regarding that use.&nbsp.
For example, to improve our Services, we collect how, when, and which parts of the Services or its features you use, which social media platforms you connect to the Services, and when, how, and what you post to the social media platforms through the Service app.&nbsp.
Also, we may use your device’s unique identifier (UDID) or other unique identifiers to assist us in collecting and analyzing this data.</p>
<p>To assist us in collecting and storing this non-Personal Information, we may employ a variety of technologies, including “Cookies,” local browser storage, and “web beacons,” “pixels,” or “tags.”&nbsp.
A “Cookie” is a small amount of data a website operator, or a third party whose content is embedded in that website, may store in your web browser and that the website operator or, as applicable, the third party, can access when you visit the website.
A web beacon, pixel or tag is a small, usually-transparent image placed on a web page that allows the operator of that image, which may be the operator of the website you visit or a third party, to read or write a Cookie.</p>
<p>Your operating system and web browser may allow you to erase information stored in Cookies, and local browser storage.
But if you do so, you may be forced to login to the Services again and you may lose some preferences or settings.&nbsp.
You may also be able to set your browser to refuse all website storage or to indicate when it is permitted, but some features of our Services may not function properly without it.&nbsp.
We may use Cookies to keep you logged in, save your preferences for the Services, and to collect information about how you use our Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information about managing Cookies is available here.
To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for your local browser storage, please refer to the end user documentation for your browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Online Tool Provider may collect information automatically, in which case Personal Information and non-Personal Information it receives are subject to the Online Tool Provider’s privacy policy.&nbsp.
Some Online Tool Providers may allow you to opt out of certain collection and/or uses of your information.&nbsp.

<b>6.
Transparency and Choice.
Do Not Track Signals</b>
</p>
<p>You may request access to your Personal Information by sending an email to info@activeminds.org.
We will try to locate and provide you with your Personal Information and give you the opportunity to correct this data, if it is inaccurate, or to delete it, at your request.
&nbsp.
But, in either case, we may need to retain it for legal reasons or for legitimate business purposes.
You may also remove any content that you post to the Services using the deletion or removal options within the Service.&nbsp.
However, we (and you) are not able to control information that you have already shared with other users or made available to third parties through the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need further assistance with removing any content you posted through the Services, you can email us at info@activeminds.org.
Removal of your posted content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal from our computer systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backups), or relate to information that is not associated with your Personal Information.&nbsp.
In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you ask us to delete your Personal Information, you may not be able to continue to use the Services.&nbsp.
Also, even if you request that we delete your Personal Information, we may need to retain certain information for a limited period of time to satisfy our legal, audit and/or dispute resolution requirements.</p>
<p>We may use third-party service providers that collect information for interest-based advertising purposes (advertisements that are tailored to your likely interests, based on categories in which you have shown an interest).&nbsp.
To learn more about these third parties and the choices they offer users, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s choices page or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s choices page.&nbsp.
If you are reading this Privacy Policy from a mobile device, you can learn more about the DAA’s mobile choices program here.&nbsp.
You may also change your Google and Facebook advertising settings visiting their respective settings pages.</p>
<p>We support the development and implementation of a standard “do not track” browser feature that provides customers with control over the collection and use of information about their web-browsing activities.
Once a standardized “do not track” feature is released, we intend to adhere to the browser settings accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the e-mails.&nbsp.
Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for your opt-out request to be processed.&nbsp.
Also, even if you opt out of marketing e-mails, we may continue to send you certain account-related e-mails, such as notices about your account and confirmations of transactions you have requested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have an objection to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy, you may file a complaint by sending an email to info@activeminds.org.&nbsp.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>9.
Information Security</b>
</p>
<p>We utilize reasonable information security measures to safeguard your Personal Information against unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.&nbsp.
For example, we utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or similar encryption technology when sensitive data is transmitted over the Internet, and use firewalls to help prevent external access into our network.&nbsp.
However, no data transmission over the Internet and no method of data storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security.</p>
<p>We restrict access to Personal Information in our possession to our employees, Service Providers, and Online Tool Providers who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, improve or support our Services.
If we share Personal Information with Service Providers or Online Tool Providers, we require that they also use reasonable information security measures to safeguard your Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>
