<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;Counter-Notice.
If you believe that your User Submission that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User Submission, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the copyright agent at DMCA@aaas.org:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
<li>Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>

and</li>
<li>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Washington, D.C., and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the copyright agent, AAAS may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.
