Additional Information Regarding Children’s Privacy
<p>If we ask a child age 13 or under to provide us with certain information such as the child’s full name, home address, email address, telephone number, age information or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child, we ask for a parent or guardian’s consent for a child to provide that information.

We do not share the children’s information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy for their own marketing purposes.
