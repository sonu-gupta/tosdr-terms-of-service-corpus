<b>1.
Collection of
your information </b>
</p>
<p>The only
information we collect <b>directly</b>
from
you is the information you enter on your registration form.
Other
information
may be collected indirectly, which is rather typical of most websites.
For
instance, your IP address and the source that referred you to our
website are
generally known.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use
third-party companies that may collect certain information when you
visit our
web site.
These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other
technologies to
collect and use <b>non-personally
identifiable</b> information.&nbsp.
The
companies we are referring to here are the AddThis Social Media Sharing
App, and
Viral Nugget, a third party advertiser whose ads appear on our pages.
These
third party companies do not get access to your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not
collect ANY information related to your payment processing, credit card
or bank
account.
The entire payment transaction is carried out at the payment
processor’s website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>2.
Sharing of
your information</b>
</p>
<p>We do not
sell, or transfer Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>The person
who sponsored you will automatically receive your name and email
address upon your
registration.&nbsp.
We
work as a team, so it
is vital that your sponsor has your contact information.
We will also
provide members that you sponsor with your name and email address upon
their request.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third party
companies may share non-personally identifiable information.
