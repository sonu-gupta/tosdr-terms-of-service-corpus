&nbsp;Important Information</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We take security and privacy seriously.</p>
<p>4.1 Security</p>
<p>We have implemented security safeguards designed to protect the information that you provide in accordance with industry standards.
Access to your data on our Services is password-protected, and data such as credit card information is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the Services.
We also offer secure https access to the surfaceOwl.com website.
To protect any data you store on our servers, we also regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.

There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information.
Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you to communicate all confidential information through other means that are secure.
Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password.</p>
