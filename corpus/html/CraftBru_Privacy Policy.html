         <p>Hello there you curious beer adventurer you!<br>
<br>Please pause your quest for beer for a second while we get serious about your privacy and the usage of this site, which is subject to a disclaimer, a copyright notice, and privacy policy.</p> Disclaimer <p>CraftBru.com (no longer a company) is maintained as a hobby website that focuses on craft breweries, festivals and whatever else of interest, from South Africa and other parts of the world.
The aim is to keep the info up to date, but changes are many and minutes are few, so there’s absolutely no guarantee as to how current or accurate the information on this site is.</p>
<p>Aside from this site’s own info, no responsibility or liability whatsoever can be accepted in regards to the information on this site, which is:</p>
<ul>

</p>
<p>To ask about using any of the content found on this site, please contact us.</p> Privacy Policy <p>At CraftBru.com we too are avid Internet users and very weary of the perils of having info shared without permission, or it ending up in the wrong hands.
We treat your data like we would want for our own.</p>
<p>
<em>In a nutshell:</em> as far as it’s under our control, we will never use your information, or willingly let it be used, for anything other than CraftBru.com related stuff that you give us permission for.</p> Cookies <p>At the time of the last update of this policy (5 July 2021), CraftBru.com, the website, generates a few <em>cookies.
</em>Essentially a cookie is a bit of information stored in your browser that most sites, this one and virtually every other, uses to do things.
WordPress (our site’s content management system) creates 3 (named <em>tk_*</em>), and if you manage to find one or more WooCommerce store pages, you’ll see 2 more.
They are all functional, do not track across the web, and contains no info that can identify you.
</p>
<p>On this date we have also removed Google Analytics and Google Ads, and as such you should not receive cookies from these services during a visit to this site.
</p> Using our eCommerce System for Bookings or Purchases <p>Our WooCommerce shop is currently disabled.
These T&amp;Cs will be updated should it be renabled.
If in the past you purchased or paid for a listing on CraftBru.com, you may request a copy of your data stored with us (if any), and even request such data be deleted, provided such data is not required for compliance with local business, industry and/or tax laws.</p> Newsletter Info <p>When you sign up to the CraftBru Monthly newsletter, we need your email address and at least your first name.
You can also complete your newsletter profile with your surname, address and birth date.
We promise not to visit you at home, ever (unless you invite us for beers and a braai).
Instead, we aggregate the towns and/or cities, which is insightful when we’re planning giveaways or promotions, and your birth date (we only ask for the day and month) will enable us to help you celebrate your birthday month with tailored special offers.</p>
<p>The newsletter’s related info is also stored offsite, at the newsletter service we use.
We only ever use that info to send the CraftBru Monthly and, in future, perhaps a birthday greeting.
The system we use sends out certain additional admin confirmation emails, like when you update your info, or you unsubscribe.</p>
<p>There is always a link in every email that allows you to unsubscribe from the email list, so, heavens forbid, if you ever get bored, you can unsubscribe and you will stop receiving them.
You can leave a reason if you want, that would be helpful, but it’s optional.</p>
<p>The service allows us to collect “rewards” in the form of credits.
At the bottom of each email you’ll see the service’s logo.
If you click that logo, sign up and maybe one day down the line decide to pay for something they offer, we will get credits to use for advanced features, or to pay for sending out our own emails.
That would require some form of tracking, so be aware of that.
The service we use (and this link would earn us those rewards if you clicked it and signed up for a paid product) is MailChimp.</p>
<p>Aaaand, that’s all of it.
If you read this far you totally deserve a beer and we should meet up for one*.</p>
<p>*you’re buying</p>
