When you watch third-party content that is made available through the Services or navigate to different third-party sites, you become subject to the third party’s terms of use and privacy policies.

We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of third party sites and services.</p>
<strong>Accounts, Premium Memberships, Payments, and School Partnerships</strong>
<p>Because we want to ensure that you and your students’ data is as safe as possible, Teacher accounts must register using an email address and must not be shared.
Collaboration and Co-Teaching tools, amongst others, are available in team plans but are not permitted on free individual user plans.
All sharing of data will require approval from the Teacher or from a school administrator in the case of school Partnerships.
If a Partner school requests Formative to sync up with your Student Information System (SIS), Learning Management System (LMS), or other system in order to automatically create accounts, you may receive an email to obtain access to the account authorized by an administrator and created by Formative.
DO NOT SHARE YOUR ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS! This could open up you and your school to potential legal issues if student data is incorrectly shared with someone that should not have access.</p>
<p>School Partnerships are entered into between Formative and either a School or District that has legal authorization to Teacher and Student Data.
Small teams may self-serve directly on our site, but a Partnership will always require written permissions and guarantees from an authorized agent of the Local Education Agency (LEA).
If Formative learns that the signing person did not have authority in the LEA to sign the Partnership agreement, it reserves the right to terminate the Partnership and all Accounts.
Formative also reserves the right to terminate any account which we think is being abused, violates our Terms of Service, creates undue risk for students, or creates issues for other educators in our system.</p>
<p>Teachers may self-upgrade to a Premium Membership directly at app.formative.com/upgrade at any time.
A credit card is required to authorize payment at the beginning of the subscription.
This subscription may or may not begin with a trial period in which the card is not charged immediately.
If a trial period exists, the Teacher can cancel their subscription at any time by visiting app.formative.com/profile/plans to avoid being charged.
If the plan is not cancelled by the first billing period, the card supplied will be charged according to the plan selected.
Billing cycles are either monthly or annually, depending on what the account holder selects.
You can continue to cancel your plan any time at app.formative.com/profile/plans.
Any cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle (e.g., if your current period ends on the 15th of the month, and you cancel on the 3rd, you will continue to have premium access for the remaining 12 days, and your account will fully cancel on the 15th).
No refund will be issued.</p>
<p>All payments for both individual Teacher subscriptions and School Partnerships are considered final and are not eligible for refund.
The only exception to this rule is that if an individual account is rolled into a School Partnership account that is overlapping and being paid for by an LEA, we may issue a pro-rated refund for the unused portion of the subscription period to avoid double payment of the time period by the LEA.
If you have any billing issues or questions, you must notify us in writing by email or support chat within 5 calendar days of the issue being addressed.
Any billing issues older than 5 calendar days will not be considered.
Formative does not store any credit card information.
We utilize the secure and vetted 3rd party system, Stripe (stripe.com), for our credit-card payment processing and subscription services.</p>
<strong>User Contributions and Content Standards.
Special Disclaimer for Legal Content</strong>
<p>Formative contains user generated content and also may contain message boards, personal web pages, forums, or other interactive features that allow you to upload, post, submit, publish, display, or transmit to other User Content on or through the Website.
All User Content must be lawful, not spammy, and clear of virus or other malware.
More specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, it must comply with the following Content Standards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not contain any material which is defamatory, obscene, indecent, abusive, offensive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
<li>Not promote sexually explicit or pornographic material, violence, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.</li>
<li>Not infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property rights of any other person.</li>
<li>Not violate the legal rights (including the rights of publicity and privacy) of others or contain any material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under applicable laws or regulations or that otherwise may be in conflict with these Terms of Service.</li>
<li>Not be likely to deceive any person.</li>
<li>Not promote any illegal activity, or advocate, promote, or assist any unlawful act.</li>
<li>Not cause annoyance, inconvenience, or needless anxiety or be likely to upset, embarrass, alarm, or annoy any other person.</li>
<li>Not be used to impersonate any person, or to misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or organization.</li>
<li>Not involve commercial activities or sales, such as contests, sweepstakes, and other sales promotions, barter, or advertising.</li>
<li>Not give the impression that they emanate from us or any other person or entity, if this is not the case.</li>
<li>Not used, if public, as test empty documents with no actual content, or typing exercises: please respect our community and help us minimize the clutter!</li>
</ol>
<p>As stated above, all the user generated legal documents are in the public domain unless otherwise specified by the author.
The rest of the content (e.g.
private documents, comments, description, guides, etc.) is creative work and therefore covered by copyright.
We claim no intellectual property rights over the User Content.
Your content remains yours.
However, by setting your documents to be viewed publicly, or by commenting in public, you agree to allow others to view, comment, edit, and branch your content.
and you grant us the right to use, copy, distribute, and disclose to third parties the content for any purpose.</p>
<p>User Content is not intended to replace official state testing or education guidelines at this time.
Use of the Website should never be understood to be replacing use of official state testing or education entities, and Formative's relationship to all documents and transactions completed using the Website is that of a trusted, disinterested third party.</p>
<p>Note also that this license to User Content continues even if you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of Content shared through the Services: when you post something publicly, others may choose to use your materials, making your Content part of other’s materials that cannot later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others.</p>
<strong>Termination and Deletion:</strong>
<p>On termination of your Account or upon your deletion of particular pieces of User Content from the Services, Formative shall make reasonable efforts to make any such non-public User Content inaccessible, cease use of it, and remove all personal information from our servers.
however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) caching of, copies of, or references to the User Content may not be immediately removed.
(b) such removed Subscriber Content may persist in backups (not available to others) for a reasonable period of time.
and (c) such removed User Content may be available (and stored on our servers) through the accounts of other Subscribers, such as because of cloning documents or shared assessment questions.</p>
<strong>Law and Copyright Infringement</strong>
<p>We do not undertake to review all material before it is posted on the Website, and we cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted.
Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party.
In the unlikely event we receive a disclosure request from an authorized party, we reserve the right to disclose user identities when required to do so by the law, including in response to a law enforcement request supported by a valid court order.
You waive and hold harmless the Company from any claims resulting from any action taken by the Company during or as a result of its investigations and from any actions taken as a consequence of investigations by either the Company or law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>If you believe that any User Content violates your copyright, please follow the procedure set forth by article 512(c) of the DMCA, and provide us a written takedown notice including the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</li>
<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.</li>
<li>Information reasonably sufficient for us to contact you, such as email, address, or telephone number.</li>
<li>A statement that you in good faith believe that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The notice should be addressed to dmca@formative.com, or via snail mail to DMCA Designated Agent, c/o Formative, 1158 26th Street, #161, Santa Monica, CA 90403.</p>
