<strong>Data Sovereignty<br>
</strong>
<p>Nearly all countries have laws that protect personal data privacy.
Some countries require that personal data be stored exclusively on servers located in-country.

</ul>
<strong>European Union – General Data Protection Regulation (</strong>
<strong>GDPR</strong>

As GDPR is new, no third country or territory has yet been approved by the Commission.
ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.
