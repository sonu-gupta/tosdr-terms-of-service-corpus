Who are we?
<p>The Customer Union for Ethical Banking (CUEB) is an independent, not-for profit cooperative.
Its members are Co-op Bank customers who support the aims of the cooperative.
CUEB is keeping a constant eye on the Co-op Bank, ensuring that it sticks to its ethical principles and aiming eventually to help it return to cooperative ownership.
