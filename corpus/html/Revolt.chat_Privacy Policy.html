Introduction
<p>We get that legal documents can be overwhelming and boring, so we've tried our best to keep it as simple and possible while providing the information needed.
It is important however to remember that these terms are legally binding between yourself and us if you choose to use Revolt, so please read them carefully before proceeding - We will continue to improve and tackle some sections.</p>

Our commitment to children's privacy

This applies to every user of our platform, regardless of different consent laws in different countries.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.
If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years of age, we will immediately delete that information from our servers.
If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us please contact us at contact@revolt.chat</p>

hCaptcha
<blockquote>
<p>This section has been adapted from hCaptcha's documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website.
This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI").
hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program.
To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics.
This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled.</p>
<p>When using the Revolt App, hCaptcha will only begin analysis when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit a login request.</li>
<li>Submit a registration request.</li>
<li>Submit a password reset / email resend request.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g.
IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user).
The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI.</p>
<p>Data processing is based on Art.
6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam.
IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
