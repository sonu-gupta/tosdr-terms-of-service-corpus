<p>Jurisdiction.
These Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of Delaware, without reference to its choice of law rules.</p>
<p>Dispute resolution.
All claims, disputes, or other differences including but not limited to all claims, defenses, counterclaims, disputes or other differences arising from or relating in any way to the Terms and Services (whether contractual, tortious, or otherwise in nature) – shall be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration (all aspects of which shall be kept strictly confidential) pursuant to the United States of America Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, with arbitration to occur in Dover, Delaware, USA before a sole arbitrator, and the American Arbitration Association to administer the arbitration.
The arbitrator, who shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including but not limited to any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of this arbitration provision, shall award the prevailing party attorney’s fees, costs and expenses in connection with the arbitration (including, if applicable, its expert witness expenses and attorney’s fees associated with its internal attorney hours), including but not limited to any appeal or enforcement proceedings.
