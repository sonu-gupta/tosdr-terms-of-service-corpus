Caching
<p>This site utilizes caching in order to facilitate a faster response time and better user experience.
Caching potentially stores a duplicate copy of every web page that is on display on this site.
All cache files are temporary, and are never accessed by any third party, except as necessary to obtain technical support from the cache plugin vendor.
Cache files expire on a schedule set by the site administrator, but may easily be purged by the admin before their natural expiration, if necessary.</p>

The information we collect depends on how the User sets up Akismet for the Site, but typically includes the commenter’s IP address, user agent, referrer, and Site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address, and the comment itself).</p>
