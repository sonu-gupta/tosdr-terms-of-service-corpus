<strong>Information we collect</strong>
Why We Collect Information
<p>We collect information so we can identify you as our customer, to establish, manage and protect your accounts, to complete your transactions, to create and offer you products and services you might be interested in, to personalize and improve upon your experience with us and to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
Non-Identifying Information
<p>We may collect information from your visit or as part of the registration and administration of your account, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, such as, without limitation, age and individual preferences (“Non-Identifying Information”).</p>
Cookies
<p>The Services may place “Cookies” on a visitor’s device.
Cookies are small text files.
Our Cookies save anonymized data about individual visitors, allowing our Services to recognize information about a visitor and help deliver personalized content and other services and functions.
Cookies make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient.
The Services use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user’s device until they expire or are manually deleted.
The Services also contain coding from our business and technology partners which generates third party cookies.
Third party cookies allow our business and technology partners to store non-Identifying Information they can access when you visit this or other websites.
Accepting a cookie from a web or device browser may give us access to Personally Identifiable Information for analytics purposes.</p>
<p>Most website and mobile device browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and provide the ability to remove them.
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.
Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are using our Services.</p>
Device and Connection Information
<p>When you use our Services, we will identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device.
The IP address does not identify you personally, but it lets us identify the device you are using.
We store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes.
We may also collect other device-specific information about the device you are using, including what type of device it is and hardware model, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identified, geo-location data, and crash data.
Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings.
Check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn more about what information your device makes available to us.</p>
Web Beacons (1×1 Pixels or GIFS)
<p>Our Services may contain coding known as Web Beacons that use 1×1 pixel images to capture and transmit the online activity of users on our Services.
These Web Beacons typically transmit information about form completions and other activities in order to measure advertising effectiveness or store analytics information.
In addition, we may use Web Beacons in HTML-based emails.
This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our email communications and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened.</p>
Log Files
<p>Like most websites, our servers utilize log files.
Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.
Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track Users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We use log file information at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our website.</p>
Google Analytics Feature
<p>We may use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the Website.
Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website.
We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website.
Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other identifying information.
We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personally Identifiable Information.
Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.
Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Website by disabling the Google Analytics cookie on your browser.
You can also view and change the currently available opt-outs for Google Ads.</p>
Other Analytics Tools
<p>In addition to or in lieu of Google Analytics, we may use other similar web analytics tools to collect information about our Website.
Regardless of the tool selected, we use this information only to improve the Website.
Any analytics tools we use collect the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, your name and email address.
We only use analytics tools that are GDPR-compliant and that meet our auditing and privacy standards.</p>
Google Drive
<p>If you choose to link your Google Drive account to a Nelnet Campus Commerce product for easy access to your files, Nelnet Campus Commerce will use Google’s OAuth protocols to establish that connection.
Nelnet Campus Commerce will not use this information in any manner inconsistent with this policy or for any purpose other than allowing you access to your Google Drive.
Nelnet Campus Commerce will not read, edit, delete, or copy files or information without your permission or as instructed by you.
You may disconnect Nelnet Campus Commerce’s site or application at any time by removing access through your Google account.</p>
Do Not Track Signals
<p>Do Not Track is a feature in your web browser, which enables you to opt-out of the third party tracking of your online activities over time and across third party websites.
We do not track users across third party websites to provide targeted advertising, and therefore, do not process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit this Website or use our Services.
Third parties cannot collect any Personally Identifiable Information from this Website unless you provide it to them directly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Information from this Website or paper forms</li>

<strong>How We Use Your Information</strong>
Uses of Information
<p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personally Identifiable Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.
But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).
We may combine your Personally Identifiable Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Website and Services are used.
We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>
<p>If you supply us with your e-mail address, we may let you know by e-mail about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you.
You will have the opportunity to tell us you do not want to receive future messages with each message you receive.
If you e-mail a question or comment to us, we will use your e-mail address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your e-mail address, your message, and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations.
When we collect your e-mail address this way, we will not use it for marketing our products and services unless you have given us permission.</p>
<p>If you wish to change any of your personal information, you may change it by logging into your account.
by contacting Customer Service, either through email, mail, or telephone.
or by contacting your Educational Institution.</p>
