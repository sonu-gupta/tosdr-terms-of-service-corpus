LEGAL BASES FOR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION <p>Laws other than the federal, state and local laws of the United States do not apply to our watch-at-home movie Services (e.g., FandangoNOW/M-GO and Vudu) as content from those Services can be viewed only in the United States.
Similarly, for our movie ticketing Services (e.g., Flixster, Fandango.com and MovieTickets.com), the only laws that shall apply are the laws of the countries in which the theaters ticketed by each respective Service are located.
The information set forth below in this section is applicable only to European Users of Rotten Tomatoes.
It supplements certain sections of this Privacy Policy and provides additional information that should be read together with other sections of this Privacy Policy.
To the extent there is any conflict between this section and another section of this Privacy Policy, this section shall govern.</p>
<p>When this policy mentions "Fandango", "we", "our" or "us", it refers to the company or companies responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (or “Data Controller”).
This includes Fandango Media, LLC and Fandango’s Owners (as defined above), currently NBCUniversal, LLC and Warner Bros (please see above for further information on these companies).</p>
<p>The laws of some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, require companies to tell you about the legal basis for using, sharing, or disclosing your information.
To the extent those laws apply, we may rely on the following legal bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Performance of a contract: </strong>where use of your information is necessary to provide you with the Services under a contract, for example the terms of service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Legitimate interest: </strong>where use of your information is necessary for our or others’ legitimate interests and where the use is not outweighed by your rights and interests.
Below are some examples of such interests: <ul>
<li>providing the Services</li>
<li>improving the Services and developing new ones</li>
<li>recognizing and better understanding our users, including across platforms</li>
<li>conducting security and fraud prevention activities</li>
<li>marketing and promoting our content and services</li>
<li>building and managing business relationships</li>
<li>conducting compliance and risk management activities </li>
<li>providing and managing access to our systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Legal obligation: </strong>where use of your information is necessary to comply with laws and regulations such as those relating to anti-bribery and corruption and anti-money-laundering, complying with requests from government bodies or courts, or responding to litigation.</li>
<li>
<strong>With consent: </strong>we may ask for your consent to process your information in a certain way.
Where we rely on this basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time – please see the Your Rights and Your Choices sections below to do this.</li>
</ul> How Long We Keep Your Information <p>We will keep your information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law.
We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law.
The retention period that applies to your information may vary depending on the Services you use and how you interact with them.</p> 4.
CHILDREN <p>The Services are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, and thus if you are under 13 we ask that you do not use the Services or provide us with any information.
If we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information then we will, to the extent required by law, delete such information from our records.
There is one exception to this: we may offer a Service that is directed to children under the age of 13, and if we do it will state that it collects information from children, and it will also have a separate privacy policy posted detailing the practices specific to that Service.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under 13 has provided us with information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@fandango.com.</p> 5.
YOUR RIGHTS <p>Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your information.
For example, under local laws, you may be able to ask us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide access to certain information we hold about you, in some cases in a portable format, if technically feasible</li>
<li>update or correct your information</li>
<li>delete certain information</li>
<li>restrict the use of your information</li>
</ul>
<p>We will respond within the time period prescribed by applicable law.
Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations.
You have the right not to be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights under some local laws such as in California.</p>
<p>Some Services can be provided only if we have your information, therefore deletion of your information will result in termination of such Services.</p>
<p>We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, including authenticating you through the email address we have on file.
We may require further documentation such as a password and user ID before granting access to your information.
