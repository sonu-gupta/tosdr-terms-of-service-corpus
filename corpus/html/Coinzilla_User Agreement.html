<strong>Coinzilla Marketplace - Advertisers</strong>
<br>
All the articles purchased through Coinzilla Marketplace are guaranteed to remain live on the publisher’s website for an indefinite period.
However, the publisher will be allowed to remove the article if:
</p>
<ol>

</li>
<li>
The advertiser’s project is no longer active.
</li>
<li>
The advertiser changed his domain of activity and the content is no longer reflecting the current activity of the advertiser.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If any of the aforementioned conditions are met and the publisher deletes the sponsored content, Coinzilla is in no way responsible and a refund will not be possible.
</p>
<p>
If the sponsored content was deleted by the publisher without a valid reason, the advertiser will receive a full refund for that article.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Coinzilla Marketplace - Publishers</strong>
<br>
If a publisher deletes a sponsored article delivered to his website through the Coinzilla Marketplace service, he is required to notify Coinzilla in regards to the deletion as well as the reason behind the decision.
</p>
<p>
If the publisher does not provide a valid reason for deleting the article, he will be required to fully refund the cost of the said article to Coinzilla.
Valid reasons for article deletion include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The advertiser’s project was proven to be a scam.
</li>
<li>
The advertiser’s project is no longer active.
</li>
<li>
The advertiser changed his domain of activity and the content is no longer reflecting the current activity of the advertiser.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the publisher does not refund the cost of the article he deleted, his Coinzilla Marketplace account will be locked, and the restrictions may extend to his Coinzilla Display account as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Reporting (Stats)</strong>
<br>
All campaigns on Coinzilla are served, tracked, and reported by Coinzilla.
For campaigns that involve third-party serving/tracking, accounting may be beyond Coinzilla's control.
</p>
<p>
The data generated by a campaign will only be available for 1 year.
After that, the data will be automatically deleted from your account.
The user is solely responsible of downloading and saving that data, if he wishes to do so.
