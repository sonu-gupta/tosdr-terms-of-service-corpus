<p>In accordance with applicable laws and lawful basis for processing, we may use your personal data to provide you with direct marketing about our products and services as well as those of third parties and to take part in our marketing research.</p>
<p>We will ensure that any direct marketing from us and which is sent by electronic means will provide a simple means for you to stop further communications, in accordance with applicable law.

<p>In addition, if we need your consent for direct marketing under applicable law, and if you provide your consent, you will be able to change your mind at any time.</p>
<p>We use 3rd parties to conduct some of our email campaigns using their contact lists, such as for scientific research, scholarly publishing and scientific education and for reasons such as promoting our journal products to drive manuscript submissions and promotion of our education resources, etc.
We will provide such 3rd parties with a stop list of those who have specifically opted out of receiving such emails on the proviso that this list is deleted after the campaign is completed.</p>
<p>In the instance that marketing material we send you is returned, we will remove your incorrect details from our systems, where possible.</p>
<p>If you complete a contact form on one of our websites, your query and data will be forwarded to our relevant internal team to answer and respond.</p> Publishing
<p>Authors submit their manuscript and personal details via online submission and peer review systems.
If a manuscript is accepted the files will be transferred to our Production system, including your personal data.</p>
<p>We may use your personal data to contact you to invite you to serve as a peer reviewer.
We will refrain from doing this if you inform us that you do not want to take part in such activity.</p>
<p>Your personal information may be included in our internal tracking and archiving processes.</p>

<p>RSC does itself carry out automated decision making or profiling.

<p>We have a procedure in place in relation to our use of images through use of photographs and video, including process for consent to use (as applicable), retention and deletion.
For more information please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address shown above.</p>
<p>RSC operates CCTV surveillance cameras at Thomas Graham House and at Burlington House.
Surveillance is monitored through a live feed by RSC staff within our Facilities Management and Hospitality teams.
Off-site/remote access to surveillance footage is only granted to designated staff and is provided securely through our IT system, subject to our off-site working practices and policies.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras are located in public access areas such as meeting rooms, post rooms, corridors, cafes, canteens, libraries, stairs, lifts, reception areas and fire exits.
Surveillance cameras on these sites record images only.
there is no recording of sound.</p>
<p>Designated RSC staff have 24 hour access to the surveillance feeds and may access them during out of office hours in the case of an emergency, incident or alarm activation at our sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surveillance footage is stored securely for a period of 60 (sixty) days in our UK based servers, after which time the surveillance footage is automatically deleted.</p>
<p>In the event of an incident or accident at either site, the footage may be downloaded by our staff and stored securely on our UK based servers in the interests of preserving evidence for any potential investigation and/or claim(s).
Any such downloaded footage may also be shared with the relevant authorities, including the police, where we are required to do so by law.
We may retain footage that is downloaded and/or stored for these purposes for a period up to 6 (six) years to take into account the statutory limitation periods for any potential investigation(s) and claim(s).
Once any potential investigation(s) or claim(s) has concluded, we will delete the relevant footage.</p>
<p>Access to the surveillance footage is limited to staff and those third party contractors that are required to perform maintenance and servicing of the surveillance camera equipment, including ADT Fire and Security PLC (“ADT”).
ADT are our chosen third party contractors for this service at both sites, however, alternative third party contractors in the same industry may be used by us to maintain and service our surveillance camera equipment in the event of an emergency or a change in our requirements.
ADT, or any such third party contractor, will not have access to the surveillance footage off-site/remotely.</p>

<p>The Royal Society of Chemistry is a global organisation with subsidiary companies located around the world.
This Statement establishes our global principles for the collection, use and disclosure of information gathered through our websites and applications.
The country in which you are doing business with us or where the website you are visiting is located/hosted may have specific requirements concerning personal data.</p>
<p>On occasion, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
By way of example, this may happen where any of our servers or those of our third party service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA.
These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK.
Where possible, we will seek to work with service providers whose servers are located within the EEA.</p>
<p>If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy.
These steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your personal information or ensuring that the recipients are subscribed to ‘international frameworks’ that aim to ensure adequate protection.</p>
<p>We have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used.
You can contact us at&nbsp;DPO@rsc.org&nbsp;for the details as to how we protect specific transfer of your data.</p> Children’s Data
<p>We recognise any individual under the age of 18 years old as being a child.
We take safeguarding of children (including the protection of their personal data) seriously and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that children are provided with sufficiently clear information on how we will collect, process and store their personal data, and that children&nbsp;and their guardians understand the nature of the processing of their personal data together with their rights in respect of the same.</p>
<p>Save for photography and filming, children under 18 years old may be able to provide consent in their own right to the processing of their personal data depending on their maturity and ability to understand the nature of the processing of that data.
We will take reasonable steps to assess a child’s maturity and ability to understand the nature of data processing before determining whether a child can reasonably consent to processing in their own right.
Further information on how we will assess a child’s ability to consent in their own right can be supplied on request via our contact details above.</p> Special categories of personal data
<p>We may collect special categories of personal data if it is provided to us by you, or on your behalf, with your consent and it is appropriate to the service that we will provide to you.
By giving us this information, you agree that we may use such data as set out in this Statement.</p> Data anonymisation and aggregation
<p>We may anonymise or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymised or aggregated data, for example, for statistical analysis and administration including analysis of trends, to carry out actuarial work, to tailor products and services and to conduct risk assessment and analysis of costs and charges in relation to our products and services.
We may share anonymised or aggregated data with third parties.</p> Your rights
<p>We also offer the following controls:</p>
<ol>
<li>You may request access to, or copies of, the personal data that we hold about you.
If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us at DPO@rsc.org or the RSC designated address above;</li>
<li>If you believe that any data we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, or have concerns as to how we are using your data please contact us at DPO@rsc.org as soon as possible.
We will take steps to seek to correct or update any data if we are satisfied that the data we hold is inaccurate.</li>
<li>You may request that your personal data is deleted, where it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it is being processed and provided there is no other lawful basis for which we may continue to process such data;</li>
<li>If we are processing your personal data to meet our legitimate interests, you may object to such processing.
If we are unable to demonstrate our legitimate grounds for that processing, we will no longer process your personal data for those purposes;</li>
<li>You may withdraw any consent given to processing (this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal).
or</li>
<li>If we are processing your personal data automatically, for the purposes of performing our contract with you, or based on your consent you may have the right to request that the personal data we hold about you be transferred to a third party data controller.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you consider that we are in breach of our obligations under data protection regulation, you may lodge a complaint with the&nbsp;Information Commissioner’s Office.</p> Retention
<p>We have criteria in place in relation to how we determine the period for which we use your personal data, as well as a process for their deletion at the end of the relevant retention period.
&nbsp;For more information please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address shown above.
&nbsp;In certain circumstances, we may be required to retain your personal data for longer where such retention is required by law or record-keeping requirements, including managing our relationship with you, defending any claims, or for tax purposes.</p> Changes to this Statement
<p>This statement is not a contract, and it does not create any legal rights or obligations.
We may change this Statement from time to time in order to reflect changes in the law and/or our privacy practices.
We will update the date at the top of the Statement accordingly.
We encourage you to regularly check this Statement online for changes.</p> Help &amp.
