However, in plain English, <strong>we do not share, sell, or otherwise give away private information to anyone! At most, some non-personal information such as IP address and web browser version will be made available as a basic mechanic of the internet, but that’s it.

<li>Automated Decision-Making: This is your right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.
This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable European law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
</ul>
