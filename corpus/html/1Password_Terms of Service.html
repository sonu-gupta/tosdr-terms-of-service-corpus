(“us”, “we”, or “our”).
It is important that you read this carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms.</p>

These Terms apply to all visitors, users, customers, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

Any modifications to the Service are also subject to these Terms.
AgileBits reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service or any feature or functionality thereof at any time without notice.
All rights, title and interest in and to the Service will remain with and belong exclusively to AgileBits.</p>Subscriptions<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)").
You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”).
