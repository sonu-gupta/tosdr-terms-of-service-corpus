👨‍💻 The admin
<p>I'm @angristan, the admin, a french tech enthusiast and Linux sysadmin at a French managed web hosting company.
I'm a student in a French IT school at the same time.</p>
<p>I run an english blog and a french blog if you're interested.</p>
<p>I made an account dedicated to mstdn.io news: @admin.
Thus you don't have to follow my personnal account to get the latest news on the instance.</p>
<p>I'm the only admin here so feel free to toot me if you have any question or concern about the instance!</p>
<p>Also, I'm a heavy user of Mastodon, so you can be sure this instance won't be abandoned because I lost interest.
I launched mstdn.io because I love FOSS, dencentralization and free software, so this is one of my hobby.
