On some Sites, we may ask the user to provide us with the user's age information.
If the person indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, as permitted by law, we will (i) collect no or limited personal information (e.g.
persistent identifier and/or email address only) from that individual, (ii) inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, and/or (iii) collect the email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address.
We may use the parent's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity.
Once a parent provides consent, we may use any information collected from a child consistent with the rest of this Privacy Policy and/or the terms of the consent provided by the parent.
If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
