Certain features of our Applications and Services allow you to share work you have created by providing a link to your uploaded content.
Access to uploaded content is controlled by knowing this link.
You can send it to other users, in which case they will have access to view and download the linked content.
To enable such content sharing functionality, we have to store content you have chosen to upload in our cloud storage, which is typically hosted by a 3rd party provider such as Google or Amazon.
Even if your data is deleted from our Services, copies of it may remain stored in offline backups for a period of time, and we might keep copies of data such as payment transactions if we are required to by law.</li>
<li>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
You can always find the latest version at www.alightcreative.com/privacy.
You must discontinue your use of our Services if you do not agree to the changes.</li>
