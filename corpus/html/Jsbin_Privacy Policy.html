Only aggregated, anonymised data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the JS Bin Website and service.
We currently use Google Analytics (traffic analysis, SEO optimisation) and Librato (metrics).
We listed below what data these third parties extract exactly.
Feel free to check out their own Privacy Policies to find out more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics: anonymous (ad serving domains, browser type, demographics, language settings, page views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP address)</li>
<li>Librato: numbers of types of requests and time taken to complete transactions</li>
</ul> employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”).
We may need to share personal information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you.
Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.
<p>We may choose to buy or sell assets.
In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.
Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
If you have a registered account, we will strive to allow you to download your complete history of Bins as HTML files.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics and Librato to collect anonymous data (like browser type and timing metrics) to help make the site better.</p>
<p>If we are acquired (or substantially so), your privacy is protected by this policy.
We are also working on the ability to download a complete zip file of all your bins (for free logged in users) so you can backup your own content irrespective of what happens to JS Bin.</p> Changes to the Privacy Policy <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
If we make major changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Website or sending you an email.
In any case, you can track all changes our repo.
A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when they use the Services after such changes have been first posted.</p>
<p>Should you have any question or concern, please write to jsbin@leftlogic.com.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>This privacy policy may change over time, and we'll notify of anything significant.
Either way you can track it's complete history in our open source repo.</p>
