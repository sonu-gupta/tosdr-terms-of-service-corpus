<p>PRIVACY STATEMENT</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement covers the information
practices of Hertz Car Sales, LLC and its applicable car sales subsidiaries and
affiliates whose registered office is 8501 Williams Road Estero, Florida 33928
("Hertz") and is to be read in conjunction with the The Hertz
Corporation Privacy Policy which can be found here.
This Privacy Statement was last updated December 31, 2019.
</p>
<p>Hertz believes strongly in protecting your
privacy and the confidentiality of your Personal Information.
We acknowledge
that you may have privacy and security concerns with respect to the information
we collect, use, and disclose to third parties for the purpose of allowing us
to view and/or sell our vehicles and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
services to you.
As used in this Statement, Personal Information is any
combination of information, in the possession of or likely to come into the
possession of Hertz, that identifies,
relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably
be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household
("Personal&nbsp.
Information")&nbsp.
and&nbsp.
will&nbsp.
be&nbsp.
treated&nbsp.
in&nbsp.
accordance&nbsp.
with&nbsp.
this&nbsp.
Privacy Statement.
Any information which cannot be used to identify a discrete individual or household (such as aggregated statistical information) is not Personal
Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PURPOSE FOR
COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Hertz
collects, uses and discloses your Personal Information in its normal course of
business for the following purposes:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Where you are interested in purchasing a vehicle from Hertz, assisting you in the completion of your application and the assessment of your eligibility for making such a purchase;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Where you have
purchased a vehicle from Hertz, the processing and maintenance of any
additional services you have obtained with the purchased vehicle, as well as
any applicable renewal of such service;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Establishing and maintaining communications with you;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Responding to your inquiries about other
vehicles or services;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Allowing our affiliated companies to notify
you of certain vehicles, products,
or services offered
by our affiliated companies;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Processing transactions through service providers
(e.g.
banks);</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Meeting legal, security, processing, and
regulatory requirements;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Protecting against fraud, suspicious or other
illegal activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p>The information gathered by Hertz during the
initial interest and/or purchasing process falls into two categories: (1)
information voluntarily supplied you and (2) information provided by third
parties necessary to complete any sales transaction.</p>
Information voluntarily provided by you
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When purchasing or viewing a vehicle, you may
choose to provide us with information to help us serve your needs.
The Personal
Information that we collect will depend on what those needs are.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Where and what type of vehicle you are looking
to purchase</p>
<p>To best provide you with a positive experience,
we may collect information about your preferences and needs in a vehicle.
We
may use this information to communicate with you in the future regarding such
preferred vehicle.
We may also collect information related to any additional
services which go along with purchasing such a vehicle.
For example, we may
collect information related to your financing needs, your warranty or servicing
needs, and other services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
which are
offered with the vehicle by third parties (like OnStar subscriptions, SIRIUSXM
subscriptions or AT&amp;T in-vehicle hot-spot services).
If you request further
information about third party services, we require you to submit your name,
e-mail address, and other Personal Information so we may send you the material you have requested,
and to enable us to support the third party offering those services to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Personal Information that you send us will
be used for the purpose indicated this Privacy Statement or as otherwise
necessary for the completion of the sales transaction you agree to.</p>
Information provided by Third Parties
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of your purchase of a vehicle from
Hertz, we may be required to collect information from third parties such as
governmental or taxing authorities.
Additionally, we may be required to check
your credit history if you are contemplating financing your purchase of a
vehicle.
As a consequence, we will also collect information from consumer
reporting agencies relating to your credit and insurability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO OTHERS</p>
<p>We do not disclose any Personal Information
about you to any third parties except as stated in this Privacy Statement, as
otherwise permitted by law, or authorized by you.
We may sell or otherwise
monetize your information to unrelated third parties where permitted by law.
</p>
<p>Third parties to whom we disclose information
are required by law and contractual undertakings to keep your Personal
Information confidential and secure, and to use and disclose it for purposes
that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances, in
compliance with all applicable legislation, which purposes are as follows:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
To provide the products and services you have
requested from us;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
To notify you or allow our entrusted
third parties to notify you of certain products or services offered by our entrusted third parties;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
For legal, claims settlement and valuation services;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
To process transactions through data
processing service providers;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
If the information is a credit card number, to
process credit card payments-through third party payment processing, clearing
and settlement systems in association with various banks.
and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
To other financial institutions with whom we
have joint marketing agreements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these third parties wish to use your
Personal Information for any other purpose, they will have a legal obligation
to notify you of this and, where required, to obtain your consent.
Contact us
at Privacy@Hertz.com
for more information on these third parties.</p>
<p>Affiliate
Sharing</p>
<p>In the normal course of performing services
for our clients, Personal Information may be shared within Hertz and its
affiliates for marketing, research and statistical purposes, system
administration, and crime prevention or detection.</p>
<p>Service
Providers</p>
<p>Hertz vehicles often have services which
correspond or are otherwise available to the owner of the vehicle.
For example,
warranty, road-side services, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
mobile communication services may be available for the vehicle you are
purchasing.
In order to best support your acquisition and use of such services,
your Personal Information may be disclosed
to these service providers as part of your transaction with Hertz.</p>
<p>Additionally,
Hertz may engage other third party service
providers in support
of our interaction with you.
We will provide relevant
personal Information to these
service providers as well.
Hertz's service suppliers adhere to the same
protections regarding the collection, use, and retention of data as we do.</p>
<p>Business
Transactions</p>
<p>As we continue to develop our business, we
might sell or buy assets.
In such transactions, user information, including
Personal Information, generally is one of the transferred business assets.
Also,
if either Hertz itself or substantially all of Hertz assets were acquired, your
Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.
Therefore, we may
disclose and/or transfer your Personal Information to a third party purchaser
in these circumstances</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Legally Required Disclosures</p>
<p>Hertz preserves the right to disclose, without
your prior permission, any Personal Information about you if Hertz has a good
faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the
rights, property or safety of Hertz, employees, other customers or clients, or
the public.
(b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to the purchase of
a vehicle.
or (c) as required by a legally valid request from a competent
governmental authority.
We may also disclose Personal Information as we deem necessary
to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental
request</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LIMITING COLLECTION AND RETENTION
OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Hertz will
collect, use, or disclose Personal Information that is necessary for the
purposes described in this Statement or as permitted by law.</p>
<p>Hertz will collect
Personal Information by fair and lawful means.
We will normally retain Personal
Information as long as necessary
for the fulfillment of the Identified Purposes.
However, some Personal Information may be retained
for longer periods
as required by law, contract,
or auditing requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SAFEGUARDS</p>
<p>We have in place physical, electronic and
procedural safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information we
maintain.
Safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity, format, location,
amount, distribution and storage of the Personal Information.
They include
physical, technical, and managerial measures to keep Personal Information
protected from unauthorized access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACCURACY, ACCOUNTABILITY, OPENNESS AND
CUSTOMER ACCESS</p>
<p>Our knowing about changes to some of your
Personal Information (e.g.
email address) may be key to effectively
communicating with you at your request.
If any of your details change you can
update us by e-mailing us at contact@Hertz.com.
Please keep us informed of changes to your Personal Information.</p>
