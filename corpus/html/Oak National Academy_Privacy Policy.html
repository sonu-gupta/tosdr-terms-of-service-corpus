        Privacy<p>Updated 6 October 2022</p>1.
Introduction<p>Oak National Academy is committed to protecting and preserving the privacy of visitors to our website and other people with whom we communicate electronically (for example, by email).
Under data protection law, individuals have a right to be informed about how we use any personal data which we hold about them.
When we refer to "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>" in this notice, we are referring to you as an individual visiting our website or communicating with us electronically.
We refer to Oak Limited as “<strong>Oak</strong>”, "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>".</p>
<p>We comply with this right by providing privacy notices (sometimes called fair processing notices).
This notice sets out information about our collection and processing of personal information related to visitors to our website and other people with whom we communicate electronically.
We have a separate privacy notice for teachers who contribute, or are considering contributing, to our programme – this notice does not apply to the information that we collect about those teachers.
We also have separate privacy notices for our members of staff and contractors and suppliers.</p>
<p>We are the data controller for the purposes of data protection law.</p>
<p>Our Data Protection Officer (DPO) is Jayne Taylor.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice should be read in conjunction with our Data Protection Policy, which is available by request from our DPO.</p>

We will make this clear when we ask for consent and explain how it can be withdrawn.</p>

and</li>

</ul>6.
Collecting this data<p>Most of the personal information we hold about you comes from you directly, either via our website, through our communications and interactions with you, such as email.</p>
<p>Whenever we seek to collect information from you, we make it clear whether providing it is mandatory or optional.
If it is mandatory, we will explain the possible consequences of not complying.</p>
<p>In some cases (for example, when we host webinars), we may ask you to provide some personal information via a third party.
We will always ensure that these third parties have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure your personal information is kept safe and secure.</p>7.
How we store this data<p>We are committed to doing all we can to keep your personal information safe and secure.
We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your information.
We also make sure that any third parties that process your information on our behalf keep your personal information secure.</p>
<p>We use encrypted drives to store information.
we limit access to only those who need access.
we keep a record of data access and modification for records on our systems.
we manage and restrict all devices which have access to Oak systems or services.</p>
<p>We will delete your personal information when we no longer need it in order to manage and deliver, or as a record of, our programme or (where relevant) our relationship with you.

<ul>
<li>information about your visits to our website will be held for up to 5 years after the start of each session</li>

<p>Your personal information may be shared with third party service providers who host and process your information on our behalf in order to support our programme.</p>
<p>We share aggregated information about the use of our website with partners but this does not involve disclosure of information from which you could be identified.</p>
<p>We may also need to disclose your personal information in order to protect our legal rights and comply with our legal obligations.</p>9.
Transferring data internationally<p>Oak uses a range of services to ensure it can deliver fast and reliable video streaming to all its users.
The majority of Oak’s technology is based within the European Economic Area and is fully compliant with the EU GDPR laws.
However, some of the services we use are based outside the UK and the European Economic Area.
We only use these services where we are satisfied with their levels of security and we will put contractual safeguards in place.
Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be being transferred, stored or processed in a location outside the UK and the EEA.</p>10.
Individual’s rights regarding personal data<p>Individuals have a right to make a <strong>‘subject access request’</strong> to gain access to personal information that we hold about them.</p>
<p>If you make a subject access request, and if we do hold information about you, we will:</p>
