<u>Auto-Renewal Terms.</u>
</em> Other than as required by applicable law, GoDaddy does not retain hard copies or electronic versions of mandate, standing order or standing instruction forms and/or any signed consents relating to your usage of our automatic renewal services, and we are therefore unable to provide any such document upon request.
You may view or change your automatic renewal settings at any time by logging into your GoDaddy account.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO NOT EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, ALL SERVICES ARE OFFERED ON AUTOMATIC RENEWAL.
EXCEPT FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW IN THIS SECTION, AUTOMATIC RENEWAL AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS THE APPLICABLE SERVICE UPON EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM FOR A RENEWAL PERIOD EQUAL IN TIME TO THE MOST RECENT SERVICE PERIOD (EXCEPT FOR DOMAIN NAMES WHICH MAY RENEW FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD).
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOUR LAST SERVICE PERIOD IS FOR ONE YEAR, YOUR RENEWAL PERIOD WILL TYPICALLY BE FOR ONE YEAR.
HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT RENEWAL WITH THE PAYMENT METHOD ON FILE FAILS, GoDaddy MAY ATTEMPT TO RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE FOR A PERIOD LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY FOR THE TRANSACTION TO SUCCEED.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
UNLESS YOU DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION, GoDaddy WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE WHEN IT COMES UP FOR RENEWAL AND WILL TAKE PAYMENT FROM THE PAYMENT METHOD ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE(S) IN YOUR ACCOUNT OR YOUR DESIGNATED BACKUP PAYMENT METHOD(S) ON FILE WITH GoDaddy.
IN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING YOUR SERVICES, GoDaddy WILL FIRST ATTEMPT TO CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE(S) IN YOUR ACCOUNT.
IN THE EVENT GoDaddy CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE THIS PAYMENT METHOD, WE WILL ATTEMPT TO CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD(S) DESIGNATED AS "BACKUP" IN YOUR ACCOUNT.
RENEWALS WILL BE CHARGED AT GoDaddy’S THEN CURRENT RATES, WHICH YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RATES FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD.
IN ORDER TO SEE THE RENEWAL SETTINGS APPLICABLE TO YOU AND YOUR SERVICES, SIMPLY LOG INTO YOUR ACCOUNT MANAGER FROM THIS SITE AND FOLLOW THE STEPS FOUND HERE.
IF YOU DO NOT WISH FOR ANY SERVICE TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, YOU MAY ELECT TO CANCEL RENEWAL, IN WHICH CASE, YOUR SERVICES WILL TERMINATE UPON EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM, UNLESS YOU MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES PRIOR TO THAT DATE.
IN OTHER WORDS, SHOULD YOU ELECT TO CANCEL YOUR PRODUCT AND FAIL TO MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND GoDaddy SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.</strong>

<strong>
IN ADDITION, GoDaddy MAY PARTICIPATE IN “RECURRING BILLING PROGRAMS” OR “ACCOUNT UPDATER SERVICES” SUPPORTED BY YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (AND ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON YOUR BANK’S PARTICIPATION).
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE YOUR EXISTING PAYMENT METHOD, YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (OR YOUR BANK) MAY NOTIFY US OF UPDATES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, OR THEY MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOUR NEW CREDIT CARD ON OUR BEHALF WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO US.
IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECURRING BILLING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOTIFIED OF AN UPDATE TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, GoDaddy WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE YOUR PAYMENT PROFILE ON YOUR BEHALF.
GoDaddy MAKES NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL REQUEST OR RECEIVE UPDATED CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODIFY AND MAINTAIN YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (I) CANCELLING PRODUCTS AND (II) ENSURING YOUR ASSOCIATED PAYMENT METHOD(S) ARE CURRENT AND VALID.
FURTHER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR FAILURE TO DO SO, MAY RESULT IN THE INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND GoDaddy SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.</strong>

<p>
</p>
<p>If for any reason GoDaddy is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed, or if GoDaddy receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf.
GoDaddy also reserves the right to charge you reasonable “administrative” fees" for (i) tasks GoDaddy may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs GoDaddy may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion).
Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention.
(ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by GoDaddy staff or by outside firms retained by GoDaddy.

These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy.</p>
<p>GoDaddy may offer product-level pricing in various currencies.
The transaction will be processed in the selected currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount submitted for payment.
For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charge, which may be added to the final amount that appears on your bank statement or post as a separate amount.
Please check with the issuer of your Payment Method for details.

<strong>
<em>(D) PAY BY CHECK (ELECTRONIC PAYMENT)</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>By using GoDaddy’s pay by check option (“<u>Pay By Check</u>”), you can purchase GoDaddy Services using an electronic payment (from your personal or business checking account (“Checking Account”), as appropriate).
In connection, you agree to allow a third-party check services provider, Certegy Check Services, Inc., (“<u>Check Services Provider</u>”) to debit the full amount of your purchase from your Checking Account, which is non-refundable.
Check Services Provider will create an electronic funds transfer (“<u>EFT</u>”) or bank draft, which will be presented to your bank or financial institution for payment from your Checking Account.
The Checking Account must be at a financial institution in the United States, and payment must be in U.S.
Dollars.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Checking Account current and funded.
You agree that (i) Check Services Provider or GoDaddy reserve the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your Checking Account no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither Check Services Provider nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.
If for any reason Check Services Provider is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for the Services provided, you agree that Check Services Provider and GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment (plus any applicable fees).
GoDaddy is not responsible for the actions of Check Services Provider.
You agree that if the EFT or bank draft is returned unpaid, you will pay a service charge in accordance with the fees permitted by law for each U.S.
State.
A help article describing the Check Services Provider and outlining the service charges referenced above can be found here.
These fees may be debited from your Checking Account using an EFT or bank draft.
All fees are in U.S.
Dollars.</p>
<p>GoDaddy and its service providers, including but not limited to Check Services Provider and Complete Payment Recovery Services, Inc., may provide you with notices, including by email, regular mail, SMS, MMS, text message, postings on the services, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed.
Such notices may not be received if you violate these terms of service by accessing the services in an unauthorized manner.
Your agreement to these terms of service constitutes your agreement that you are deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the services in an authorized manner.
Failure to receive such notices for any reason shall not excuse any payment or other obligation to GoDaddy and Check Services Provider.
You further expressly authorize GoDaddy and its service providers, including but not limited to Check Services Provider and Complete Payment Recovery Services, Inc., and their affiliates to contact you, via auto-dialer, pre-recorded messages, or any other method, on any of your mobile phone numbers or emails.

<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(E) INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>GoDaddy offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of International Payment Providers (“IPP”).
In the event you select an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the IPP’s applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at GoDaddy.
You also agree to allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected account or payment method, collectively “Funding Sources”.
In addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an “Exchange Rate Conversion Fee”, as well as any other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP (collectively, the “IPP Fees”), from your Funding Sources.
You understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without notice to you by GoDaddy.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded.
You agree that (i) the IPP or GoDaddy reserve the right to decline a transaction for any reason and (ii) neither the IPP nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.
You acknowledge that GoDaddy will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor.
You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment processor.
If GoDaddy does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process again.
In the event that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the order through your GoDaddy account.
Payments received on previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the original Payment Method when possible.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If, at the time GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available for purchase.
or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems.
or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, GoDaddy may automatically issue a partial refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding) to your Funding Source.
If the IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, GoDaddy reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit balance or as a bank transfer, when the payment processor cannot refund back to the Payment Method.
If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again.
You agree that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded transaction.
Accordingly, any refunds issued by GoDaddy will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>GoDaddy offers SEPA Direct Debit (“SEPA”) as a payment method for customers located in Germany.
If you choose to use SEPA as a payment method, you are authorizing GoDaddy and Adyen, our payment service provider, to send instructions to your bank to debit your account.
By agreeing to these terms you have mandated GoDaddy to collect all of the applicable charges arising under this Agreement.
The authorization shall also apply to any new bank account used by you for purchases from GoDaddy.
We will notify you of the date of direct debit collection within a reasonable time (the “pre-notification”).
This pre-notification will be delivered to you by e-mail at least one (1) business day before payment is collected.
You are responsible for making sure that there are sufficient funds in your account to cover any debit payments.
You also agree to indemnify GoDaddy against any losses that it may incur if your financial institution withholds payment from GoDaddy for any reason.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(F) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance: (1) you may apply any available credit balance to any future purchase in your Account.
and (2) you authorize GoDaddy to apply any available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks, or other fees related to your Account.
In the event that GoDaddy is unable to successfully charge either the Payment Method associated with a specific Service in your account or your backup Payment Methods when processing Service renewals, GoDaddy may use any available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to cover the entire transaction.
Regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your account, GoDaddy is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from your Payment Methods or the in-store credit.
In-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal).
If you have more than one in-store credit, then the credits will be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first.
If additional funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-selected currency will be converted using GoDaddy’s daily exchange rate based on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance left in your account.
You understand and agree that at the time of conversion, GoDaddy may also impose an additional administrative fee.
</p>
<p>You can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time through your Account on the GoDaddy website.
You acknowledge that in-store credit balances are non-transferable, may only be used in the Account in which they were acquired and may expire.
Complimentary in-store credits will expire two years after issuance or within any other time period GoDaddy may specify in your Account.
In the event that GoDaddy terminates your Account, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be forfeited.</p>
<p>You also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by GoDaddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf.
To the extent any interest may accrue, you agree that GoDaddy is entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance functionality.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(G) EXPIRED DOMAIN NAME PURCHASES</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>For expired domains names purchased through your account, you agree that you are responsible for payment within forty-eight (48) hours of auction close for the successful bid amount plus the one (1) year renewal or transfer fee (from the end of the domain name’s previous registration period), plus ICANN fee, if applicable, or any valid payment method associated with the account, will be charged on the third day following the auction close.
If we are unable to collect payment, you may lose the rights to purchase the domain name.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(H) ROUND UP FOR CHARITY</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you participate in Round Up for Charity, you hereby authorize GoDaddy to either 1) donate an amount selected by you, or 2) round up your transaction to the nearest dollar and donate 100% of the difference, to a small business relief fund (“Donation”).
GoDaddy will take reasonable steps to ensure your Donation is properly disbursed, in our sole discretion, to qualifying small businesses negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will not withhold any Donation made by you through Round Up For Charity.
You understand your Donation is not eligible for a refund or in-store credit.</p>

DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS</strong>
</strong>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
</p>
<p>(A) <em>Disputes.</em> The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and GoDaddy, except for disputes governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy referenced above and available here.
For the purposes of this Section, “Dispute” shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and GoDaddy arising under or relating to any GoDaddy Services or Products, GoDaddy’s websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and GoDaddy, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law.
YOU AND GoDaddy AGREE THAT “DISPUTE” AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR GoDaddy FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION.
Moreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.
</p>
<p>(B) <em>Binding Arbitration.</em> You and GoDaddy further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms.
(ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce.
(iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
and (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.
The arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.</p>
<p>(C) <em>Small Claims Court.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>
<p>(D) <em>Dispute Notice.</em> In the event of a Dispute, you or GoDaddy must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the “Dispute Notice”).
The Dispute Notice to GoDaddy must be addressed to: GoDaddy, 14455 N.
Hayden Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85260, Attn.: Legal Department (the “GoDaddy Notice Address”).
The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.
If GoDaddy and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or GoDaddy may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section.
Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
(E) <em>WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.</em> YOU AND GoDaddy AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.
NEITHER YOU NOR GoDaddy WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OF PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.
NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>(F) <em>Arbitration Procedure.</em> If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA (“AAA Rules”) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims.
The AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern.
You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement.
All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.
The arbitrator is bound by these Terms.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.
Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of “Disputes” as stated above.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.
Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or in Maricopa County, Arizona, at your option.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>(G) <em>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding.</em> If either you or GoDaddy decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:</p>
<p>i.
Write a Demand for Arbitration.
The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.
You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org (“Demand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules”).</p>
<p>ii.
Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.
</p>
<p>iii.
Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>(H) <em>Hearing Format.</em> In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by GoDaddy or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or GoDaddy is entitled.
The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>(I) <em>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</em>
</p>
<p>i.
Disputes involving $75,000.00 or less.
GoDaddy will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
If you reject GoDaddy’s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (“GoDaddy’s last written offer”), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than GoDaddy’s last written offer, GoDaddy will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.00.
(ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any.
and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.
The arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and GoDaddy agree on them.</p>
<p>ii.
Disputes involving more than $75,000.00.
The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</p>
<p>iii.
Disputes involving any amount.
In any arbitration you commence, GoDaddy will seek its AAA or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.
In any arbitration GoDaddy commences, GoDaddy will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
GoDaddy will not seek its attorney’s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration.
Fees and expenses are not included in determining the amount in dispute.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>(J) <em>Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year.</em> To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute to which this Section applies must be filed within one year in small claims or in arbitration.
The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.
If not filed within one year, the claim or dispute will be permanently barred.
</p>
<p>(K) <em>30-Day Opt-out Period.</em> IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS DISPUTES SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY GoDaddy BY E-MAILING LEGALOPTOUT@GODADDY.COM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW).
In the e-mail, you must provide your (a) first name, (b) last name (c) address, (d) phone number, and (e) account number(s) and state the following: “I wish to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in GoDaddy’s Universal Terms of Service Agreement.” By providing your information in the method above, you are opting out of the agreement to arbitrate contained in GoDaddy's Universal Terms of Service.
Your opt-out request will only be valid if made within thirty (30) days of first accepting the Universal Terms of Service.
In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall contained herein shall continue to apply, including those related to the applicable governing law and the court(s) in which legal disputes may be brought.
</p>
<p>(L) <em>Amendments to this Section.</em> Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and GoDaddy agree that if GoDaddy makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to GoDaddy’s address) in these Terms, GoDaddy will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments.
If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these current Terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing.
If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.
</p>
<p>(M) <em>Severability.</em> If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect.
The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions.
if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void.
The terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.
</p>
<p>(N) <em>Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies.</em> GoDaddy and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, or the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.
You also agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any such action or proceeding.</p>
<strong>
<br>
<strong>23.
UNCLAIMED PROPERTY.
DORMANCY CHARGES</strong>
</strong>
<p>
<br>
Please be advised that if a customer has an outstanding account balance (a credit positive balance) for three (3) years or more for any reason, and (i) GoDaddy is unable to issue payment to such customer or (ii) GoDaddy issued payment to such customer in the form of a paper check, but the check was never cashed, then GoDaddy shall turn over such account balance to the State of Arizona in accordance with state law.
You acknowledge and agree that in either case (i) or (ii) above, GoDaddy may withhold a dormancy charge in an amount equal to the lesser of $25.00 or the total outstanding account balance associated with such customer.
