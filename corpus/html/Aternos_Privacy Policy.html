         Privacy Policy - Aternos <strong>Welcome to the privacy policy of Aternos,</strong>
<br> We take the protection of your data very seriously and store only what we have to.
In this policy, we will try to explain as good and comprehensible as possible which data we store and why.
<br>
<br> If you have any questions regarding your data, you can always write to us at privacy@aternos.org.
<br>
<br> Legally responsible for the protection of your data is the Aternos GmbH: <br>
<br>
<strong>Aternos GmbH</strong>
<br> Rheinweg 24<br> 53113 Bonn<br> +49 228 18038354<br>
<br> Represented by: Matthias Neid (matthias@aternos.org) Which data do we store and why? After we have clarified this, we can now talk about your data that we store: When you sign up you have to enter your username, your email address and your password or you link a Google/Facebook account.
If you connect a Google/Facebook account, we save your account identifier and the email address of that account.
<br>
<br> Usually, your <strong>username</strong> cannot be traced back to you except if it contains your name or if you also use it on other platforms.
Because of that, we protect your username the same way we protect personal data.
<br>
<br> We only use your <strong>email address</strong> to reset your password.
You receive an email with a link to perform that action in that case, which has to be executed manually on our website.
We will never use your email address for a newsletter or anything like that.
If you sign up through your Google/Facebook account, we only save your email address in case you forgot which email address you have used to sign up.
We will never send you an email in this case.
<br>
<br> Your <strong>password</strong> is already concealed on your computer (hash) and will then be stored with more security (hash + salt) on our servers.
So your password will never reach our servers in plaintext and is extra secured.
<br>
<br> We also save the <strong>point in time</strong> of your registration to create statistics.
Besides that, we have to keep that time to be able to prove that you have accepted this policy.
<br>
<br> All <strong>settings</strong> of your Minecraft server and all <strong>files</strong> that are created by your Minecraft server are saved on our servers.
Furthermore, we send this data as a backup to your Google Drive account if you want that and have it enabled.
<br>
<br> Our <strong>storage system</strong> which stores the files of your Minecraft server logs all events (e.g.
loading your files when starting the server or saving when stopping the server) together with your username or your user ID.
Those events are saved for up to 7 days and help to identify and solve general or individual problems with our storage system.
<br>
<br> Furthermore, we store how many and which <strong>players</strong> are currently on your Minecraft server to display them on the website in your account and to determine statistics on the total number of players.
<br>
<br> Every time you <strong>start your server</strong> or a <strong>player joins</strong> your server, we collect this event together with the pseudonymised (hashed) user or player name.
Those events are aggregated without personal data, and the individual events are deleted after 24 hours.
This allows us to measure how many different servers are started and how many different players join every day.
<br>
<br> Every <strong>request to our website</strong> is captured and stored for up to 24 hours.
The URL, the IP address, the session ID, the Cloudflare Ray ID and the country code provided by Cloudflare are stored.
This data is only used to analyse problems and especially to detect and defend against attacks.
<br>
<br> Besides that, we never save your <strong>IP address</strong> for the long term when you use our website.
But it is possible, that your Minecraft server writes your IP address and the IP addresses of other players into a log file.
This log file is overwritten on every start and can always be deleted by reinstalling the server.
You can always see your log file at https://aternos.org/log/.
<br>
<br> To be able to understand what happened when errors or problems occur, we save <strong>miscellaneous activities</strong> on our website in a log file, e.g.
when you start your server, who enters or leaves your server, when you up- or download a world or when you change your email address or password.
This data will not be processed automatically.
It will only be used manually to solve errors or to help you.
<br>
<br> Some <strong>errors</strong> that can occur in our system, e.g.
different errors related to transferring files or when starting your Minecraft server are stored together with your username for up to 24 hours to detect unusual peak occurrences of those errors, to analyse those errors and to solve them.
