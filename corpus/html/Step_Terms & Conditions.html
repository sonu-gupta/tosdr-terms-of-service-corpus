On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar.
Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may also use cookies on the Site.
