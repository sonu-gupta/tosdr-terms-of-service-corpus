<br>Different membership levels may apply to the Sweatcoin Accounts of different users and, depending on the membership level you hold, your entitlement to access functionality of the Sweatcoin App or generate Sweatcoins may vary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;When using the Sweatcoin App on your mobile device, you acknowledge and agree that Sweatcoin operates in the background of your mobile device, which in turn may have an impact to the battery life of such device.<br>The Sweatcoin App stops generating Sweatcoins on your mobile device if you do not open the Sweatcoin App for 30 days.
Generation of Sweatcoins restarts once you next open the app.&nbsp;5.
Sweatcoin&nbsp;“<strong>Sweatcoins</strong>” are units of exchange that users of the Sweatcoin App may generate through verified physical movement (e.g.
steps).

You acknowledge and agree that Sweatcoins may not be redeemed for cash from SweatCo or any of its affiliates, unless we expressly agree otherwise with you in writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;All Sweatcoins are generated by the verified physical movement of users of the Sweatcoin App.
Sweatcoins will never be generated by any other means.
We reserve the right to destroy Sweatcoins that we have reason to believe have been created by any other means and to suspend or disable Sweatcoin Accounts used in contravention of these Terms of Use.&nbsp;We reserve the right and retain the absolute discretion to determine, and alter from time to time, the eligible forms of movement, movement verification algorithms and amounts of verified movement that must be undertaken by users in order to generate Sweatcoins using the Sweatcoin App (for example, and without limitation, we may alter from time to time the verification algorithm or the number of verified steps required to generate a Sweatcoin).
Details of eligibility criteria and the volumes of verified movement required to generate Sweatcoins from time to time are provided within the FAQ section of the Sweatcoin App.
Movement verification conducted by our algorithms is considered final and cannot be revised or reversed.&nbsp;We may cap the maximum amount of Sweatcoins that users of the Sweatcoin App may generate each day using the Sweatcoin App.
The applicable cap may vary depending upon the membership level of the relevant user or other criteria that we chose to apply and we may alter such caps from time to time.

Details of any applicable rate of commission on Sweatcoin generation from time to time, and any Sweatcoin-denominated charges applicable to the different membership levels are provided in the FAQ section of the Sweatcoin App.&nbsp;&nbsp;We reserve the right to impose charges in relation to the use of Sweatcoin App in fiat currency from time to time, which may be applicable to all or specific categories of users or to the use of specific functionality or services accessed via the Sweatcoin App.&nbsp.

Sweatcoin Marketplace&nbsp;The Sweatcoin App enables users to offer goods, services and other benefits to other users that may be redeemed in exchange for Sweatcoins (such functionality being the “<strong>Sweatcoin Marketplace</strong>”).
&nbsp;<br>
<br>Where you use the Sweatcoin Marketplace to offer or redeem goods, services or other benefits in exchange for Sweatcoins, any such transaction is entered into directly between you and the legal person making available the relevant goods, services or other benefits to you or redeeming such goods, services or other benefits from you, as applicable.
Without limiting the effect of these Terms of Use in any way, transactions taking place on the Sweatcoin Marketplace are subject to the legal terms of the party offering the relevant goods, services or other benefits on the Sweatcoin Marketplace (including as stated in the actual listing), and we and our affiliates are not party to any such transactions save to the extent that we engage in transactions ourselves directly on the Sweatcoin Marketplace.<br>
<br>To the extent that SweatCo agrees to administer on your behalf via SweatCo’s own account any offer of goods or services or other benefits in exchange for Sweatcoins on the Sweatcoin Marketplace, SweatCo shall be entitled to retain up to 100% of the Sweatcoins received for its own benefit in its absolute discretion.&nbsp.

&nbsp;You agree that SweatCo has no responsibility for any goods, services or other benefits offered by you or by any third party on the Sweatcoin Marketplace.
You agree that we have no control over and do not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of any goods, services or other benefits offered by users, the truth or accuracy of their offers, the ability of users to provide any goods, services or other benefits offered, or that a user will actually complete or perform a transaction.
Save as otherwise expressly agreed with you, we and our affiliates do not act as agent, contractor, partner or any form of representative of you or any other user of the Sweatcoin Marketplace.
Our operation of the Sweatcoin Marketplace should not be taken as an endorsement (express or implied) of any goods, services or other benefits offered on it, nor of any user.&nbsp;&nbsp;SweatCo is entitled to alter the selection of goods services and other benefits on offer, and the number of Sweatcoins required to redeem any such goods, services or other benefits offered, on the Sweatcoin Marketplace, as well as to limit the number of possible redemptions of any good, service or other benefit by any user or group of users in its absolute discretion.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Where we wish to do this, we will notify you first and give you the opportunity to de-list the relevant goods, services or other benefits, if you do not agree with the revised number of Sweatcoins required.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>You represent and warrant to us that any goods, services or other benefits that you offer on the Sweatcoin Marketplace will: (i) conform to the description you provide for them, (ii) comply with all applicable laws and regulations, (iii) be of satisfactory quality, (iv) conform to our acceptable use requirements (stated in Section 6 above), and (v) be delivered in full once a user redeems the relevant goods services or other benefits using the requisite number of Sweatcoins in accordance with your stated terms and conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp.
