From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Site.

We may also use cookies from third party social sites and programs including, but not limited to, Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter.

However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Site may be diminished as some features may not work as they were intended.
