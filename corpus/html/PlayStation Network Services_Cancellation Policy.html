<p>In addition to the rights set forth below, you may have additional rights under applicable local law.
nothing in the policy below limits or replaces any such rights under local law.</p> Games, game add-ons, season passes, in-game consumables and PlayStation® Video titles
<p>You can cancel a digital content purchase within 14 days from the date of purchase and receive a refund, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming it.</p>
<p>Digital content that you have started downloading, or streaming, and in-game consumables that have been delivered, are not eligible for a refund unless the content is faulty.</p>
<p>You can cancel your purchase of a season pass within 14 days from the date of purchase, and receive a refund, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming any digital content (e.g.
game add-ons) included in the season pass.</p>
<p>
<i>If you purchase in-game consumables on the PlayStation™Store, they will be delivered when you next launch the game, until then you will have up to 14 days from the date of transaction to cancel.
If you purchase in-game consumables during gameplay, they will be delivered immediately so you will not be able to cancel the purchase.
In-game consumables are items such as virtual currencies (e.g.
FIFA packs or GTA Cash Packs), boosts and other items that are depleted during gameplay.</i>
</p> Pre-Orders
<p>You may cancel a pre-order of digital content at any time before the release date and receive a refund.&nbsp;If the release date has passed, you can still change your mind and request a refund up to 14 days after payment was taken for the pre-order, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming the content to your device.&nbsp;&nbsp;See more information about cancelling a pre-order here.</p> Promotional Bundles such as “3 for 2”
<p>You can cancel your purchase of a promotional bundle (e.g.
3 games for the price of 2) within 14 days from the date of transaction and receive a refund, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming any part of the bundle.</p> Subscription Services
<p>You can cancel your purchase of a subscription service and request a refund within 14 days from the initial transaction date, even after you start using the subscription.
The refund may be reduced pro-rata to reflect the use you have had of the service.
This may show as two transactions in your account transaction history: a refund to your wallet of the full amount originally paid and then a debit of a charge for the period of the service you received.</p>
<p>If you take advantage of a free trial when you sign up to a service, the 14-day cancellation period will commence on the day we accept your order of the free trial and the duration of the free trial will be included in the 14-day period.
For example, you sign up for a free trial which lasts 7 days and your wallet is debited for the subscription at the end of the trial, you will have 7 days after your wallet was debited to cancel.</p>
<p>Note: When you purchase a subscription service such as PlayStation®Plus, you agree to a rolling subscription with periodic billing (e.g.
annual billing).
You can stop making payments at any time by turning off [Auto-renewal]&nbsp;(click here for more information)&nbsp;but, beyond the initial 14-day cancellation period, you will not receive a refund for payments already made.
When you turn off [Auto-renewal], your subscription will continue until the next payment is due, at which point it will end.</p> Wallet top ups<br>
<p>You cannot cancel a PSN Wallet top-up.
&nbsp;When you ask us to top up your PSN Wallet using your credit / debit card, mobile phone, PayPal or other accepted payment method, we seek your consent to perform the top up immediately and, therefore, you cannot cancel the top up.</p> Change of Online ID
<p>You can revert to a previous online ID for&nbsp;<u>free</u>&nbsp;but you cannot cancel or obtain a refund for your purchase of a change of online ID unless faulty.</p> Purchases made outside of PlayStation™Store
<p>We do not provide refunds for purchases made outside of PlayStation™Store, such as voucher codes for PlayStation®Plus and specific games.</p> Further Information
