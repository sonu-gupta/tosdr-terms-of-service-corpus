<strong>Drupal CMS by Acolono for noyb.eu</strong>
</p>
<p>This website runs on Drupal, one of the leading Open Source CMS worldwide.&nbsp;With more than 1,000,000 developers worldwide contributing — including a large professional service provider ecosystem — Drupal&nbsp;is one of the most secure and stable platforms on the market.<br>
We have chosen Drupal because of its impressive built-in&nbsp;multilingual&nbsp;capabilities, its advanced security&nbsp;and performance features and its active local community.
The Austrian Drupal agency acolono GmbH was therefore the perfect partner.
Acolono is very active in the local Drupal association and helped organize multiple Drupal conferences and the Open Minds Award.</p>
