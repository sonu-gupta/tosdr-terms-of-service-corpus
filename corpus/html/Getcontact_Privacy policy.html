<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>
<p>Last modified: July 14th 2021</p>
<strong>1.
Who are we?</strong>
<p>When we say “Getcontact”, “our,” “we,” or “us,” we’re talking about Getverify LDA.
This Privacy Statement (“Privacy Statement”) applies to all of our apps, services, games, features, software, and website (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement explains how we will use personal data about you and the steps we take to ensure your personal&nbsp;data is kept secure and confidential.
It should be read together with our&nbsp;Terms of Service.</p>
<strong>2.
How do we collect your personal data?</strong>
<p>We&nbsp;may obtain personal&nbsp;data from you through our websites, mobile applications or other similar devices, channels or applications operated by or on behalf of Getcontact.</p>
<strong>3.
What personal&nbsp;data do we collect?</strong>
<p>We collect personal data about you in the course of registering for and/or using our Services for example we may collect your name, telephone number and email.</p>
<p>Note that it is your responsibility to check and ensure that all information, content, material or data you provide us is correct, complete, accurate and not misleading.</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Information that you may provide voluntarily</strong>
</i>
</p>
<p>Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal data voluntarily.
For example, we will request for specific information in order for you to complete account registration, to begin using our Services, to distribute information among other users and to share information with other users when communicating through our Services, to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact and correspondence information (such as name and email address);</li>
<li>Username and password;</li>
<li>Profile information (such as profile photo and biography).
and</li>
<li>Other data you choose to give us (such as data to identify a lost account).</li>
</ul>
<p>The personal data that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, we will try to explain to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal data.</p>
<p>For your enhanced security and privacy, we do not technically decrypt or retain any messages or content delivered over our Services (including your chats, media, audio or video files) in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you.</p>
<p>Your messages and your message history are stored on your own device and are deleted from our servers as soon as it is practicably possible.</p>
<p>If messages or content cannot be delivered immediately.
For example, if you are offline or your phone is switched off, we may keep it on our servers under end-to-end encryption for up to 30 days before permanent deletion, for the sole purpose to complete the delivery of the messages or content to the intended recipient.</p>
<p>You may also choose to provide us with information in connection with your interaction with our Services.
For example, you may through our tagging functionality flag a phone number for authentication as spam, leave comments on another user's personal profile or share with us other profile information to be collected and verified within our search directory, for the purposes of optimising our Services and preventing potential fraud or unwanted spam for users active in the Getcontact community.</p>
<p>Where our Services are obtained from Google Play or Apple App Store, we will only use permitted and publicly available information to optimise our Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not publish or disclose non-public contacts or personal data without your clear affirmative consent to do so, if and where we are legally required to ask your consent.</p>
<p>Where our Services are obtained from sources other than Google Play or Apple App Store, you may choose to share contact information with us, such as the names and numbers contained in your address book.&nbsp;However, we do not upload your address book to make it public or searchable.</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Information that you share</strong>
</i>
</p>
<p>You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.</p>
<p>You share your information (including messages, media files, comments) as you use and communicate through our Services.</p>
<p>Your phone number, username and your profile information can be available to all users of our Services.</p>
<p>Users with whom you communicate can store or share your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services.
For example, any user can take a screenshot of your messages or comments or otherwise record the information that you distribute using our Services and send it to Getcontact or other persons or publish them on another platform.</p>
<strong>Information that may be collected automatically</strong>
<p>When you use our Services and us having obtained your explicit permission to do so we may also collect data automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data and analytics about your use of our Services;</li>
<li>Your IP address and mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID, advertising ID, MAC address, IMEI);</li>
<li>Data about your device, such as device name and operating system, browser type and language;</li>
<li>Data we collect with cookies and similar technologies;</li>
<li>Broad geographic location based on your IP address;</li>
<li>Precise geo-location data (GPS, with your consent).
and</li>
<li>Data about your use of our Services, such as in application interaction and usage metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advertising ID&nbsp;means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and for Google prior to Android 12 devices, Advertising Identity (“GAID”).
These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for interest-based advertising.
They are consistent across all apps and thus allow cross-app tracking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Apple versions older than iOS 14.5 and&nbsp;iPadOS 14.5 you can opt-out this by choosing “limit ad tracking” option from privacy settings.
On Google Android you can opt-out by choosing “Opt-out of interest-based ads”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Apple versions iOS 14.5 and&nbsp;iPadOS 14.5 you will be given the option to opt in as part of the AppTrackingTransparency framework which we will provide you clear information of all the different requested permissions and the relevant purpose and use for each of the permissions.
For Google Android 12 and all subsequent releases, you can reset your GAID or opt out of personalised ads within Google Play at your discretion and at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device.
Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads.
These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognise your device when you use websites and applications.</p>
<p>Data about your device refers to information about your&nbsp;device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application.</p>
<p>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and/or similar technologies (such as "SDKs" or software development kits), as explained further below.</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Information that we may obtain from third party sources</strong>
</i>
</p>
<p>We may receive personal information about you from third party sources.
For example, if you clicked on an advertisement to direct you to one of our Services we may be provided with information from which ad-network and advertising campaign the install originated from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data that we may collect from our partners could include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Data we receive if you link a third-party tool with our Services (such as Facebook, Apple or Google);</li>
<li>Demographic data (such as to determine the location of your IP address);</li>
<li>Data to fight fraud (such as click fraud in advertising);</li>
<li>Data from platforms that our Services run on (such as to verify payment).
and</li>
<li>Data for advertising and analytics purposes, so we can optimise the Services we deliver to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not request or intend to collect any special or sensitive categories of personal data such as any information on health, race, religion, political opinions, sexual preferences or orientation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may choose to connect to our Services via a choice of third-party social platform accounts (such as Facebook, Google+, Apple or Telegram) for the strict purpose of creating and authenticating your Getcontact user profile and for logging in and registration to our Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we are granted permission by you to have access to your social platform account user ID then our Services may be visible on your social platform page that lists your “applications.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your chosen third-party social platform may automatically provide us with access to certain personal information retained by them about you, including your social platform account user ID which we may store strictly for the purpose of authenticating and retaining your account and profile preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will never store any passwords created for any third-party services.
Exactly what information we receive from your social platform account will depend on your privacy settings.</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Third-Party Information</strong>
</i>
</p>
<p>We receive information about you from other users.
For example, when users use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (such as from their mobile address book, as well as by leaving comments in a special field to your personal profile) just as you may provide relevant information about them.
They may also send you messages or call you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We require each of those users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us and we are not responsible for the disclosure of information about privacy (including personal data) as a result of the user's actions during the use of the Services.
If a comment left on a user's personal profile violates the&nbsp;Getcontact Code of Conduct, the user of this profile can send us a request to delete such a comment through the customer support here.
A request to delete a comment, regardless of reasoning, is subject to consideration and a decision is made accordingly on the basis of the Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Code of Conduct, legislation in force in the country of use of the Services.
We will make efforts to respond promptly to such a request, but in any case, the period of consideration and response to the request will not exceed 30 days from the date of receipt of such a request.</p>
<strong>4.
How do we use your personal&nbsp;information?</strong>

This function can only disclose personal data related to a number if the number is already available for search in a public database or the number has been associated to a Getcontact user who has consented to his or her number and profile information to be made available for search and for publication as part of the Getcontact directory.</p>

What cookies do we use?</strong>
<p>A cookie is a very small text file placed on your computer or device.
We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalise our Services, analyse use, target advertisements and prevent fraud.
You can disable cookies in your browser or device settings, but some parts of our Services may then not function properly.</p>
<strong>8.
What advertisements do we show on our Services?</strong>
<p>The advertisements that you see displayed on our Services are delivered on our behalf by certain third-party Advertising Partners.
No information which identifies you, for example your name, address, email address or telephone number, is used to provide this advertising.
In order to display advertising most likely to be relevant to you, these third-party advertisers may place or recognise a unique cookie on your browser.
This cookie does not collect personal information about you nor is it linked to any identifiable information about you.
By using our Services, you are consenting to the use of these third-party cookies for these purposes.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about online advertisements and your choices about how this information may be used by these companies, please find more information here&nbsp;<strong>http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices</strong>.</p>
<strong>9.
What steps do we take to keep your personal data safe?</strong>
<p>Your personal data’s security is very important to us.
This is why, where it’s appropriate, we use HTTPS to help keep information about you secure.
However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do our best to keep the information you disclose to us secure.
However, we can't guarantee or warrant the security of any information which you send to us and you do so at your own risk.
By using our Services, you accept the inherent risks of providing information online and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security.</p>
<strong>10.
How long do we keep your personal data?</strong>
<p>Unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, we will only retain your personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement and for our legitimate business purposes, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
For example, we delete all call log data within (30) days of storage as we use this data to identify and target potential spam risks or fraud patterns.</p>
<strong>11.
Do we&nbsp;host and/or transfer your personal data outside of the country you are resident?</strong>
<p>Our Services are global by nature and your personal data may be hosted/transferred in/to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
We take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in our Privacy Statement.
Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.</p>
<strong>12.
Age Limits</strong>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 16 years or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services.&nbsp.
If you learn that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, then you may alert our customer support here.
If we learn that we have collected personal data from children under 16, then we will promptly take steps to delete that data as soon as it is practicably possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<strong>13.

<p>We will require you to verify your identity or provide additional information related to your account before we let you access or update your personal information.
We may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number of reasons, including, for example, if the request is unlawful or whether to do so would impact the protection of other users in the Getcontact community.</p>
