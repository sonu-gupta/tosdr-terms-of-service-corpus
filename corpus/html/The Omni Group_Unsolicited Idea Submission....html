</ul> Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy <p>The most powerful tool that we have in our effort to make our products better is the feedback from our users.
This means you! We encourage folks to send us bug reports, questions and ideas about how to make our existing products fit their needs more closely.</p>
<p>While we also encourage folks to send us their ideas about new products, we must make it clear that any product idea submitted to Omni, either by word of mouth, email, telephone or other means immediately becomes the property of Omni.
This means that if we develop your idea or an idea similar to yours, you will not be compensated and it also means that we can use the idea for any purpose, including giving it away.</p> Slack Forums Twitter Facebook Instagram The Omni Group Logo Sitemap Contact Press Legal © 1994–2020 The&nbsp;Omni&nbsp;Group.
