You acknowledge and agree that the use of third party Payment Processors are integral to the Services and that we exchange information with such third parties in order to facilitate the provision of Services as set out in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Charities: </strong> The Do Good Points Platform includes the features and services described here.
All donations are subject to a Payment Processor Fee for each donation.
Donors have the option to cover all Payment Processor Fees at checkout.</p>
<ol>
<li>Chargebacks and Refunds.
Occasionally, a Donor may dispute a credit card charge for a Donation through the Services.
If Donations are refunded to the Donor by Do Good Points and Do Good Points already remitted payment to the Charity, we will deduct the chargebacks or refunds from future payments to the Charity, and if necessary, issue an invoice to the applicable Charity.
The applicable Charity expressly agrees that it will be responsible for paying Do Good Points the full amount of any Donation refund due to a Donor.
Do Good Points may elect to offset a future Donation rather than requesting that the Charity return the refunded Donation.
If such Donations were made through a third-party Fund, the Fund or Charity may control the Donations, rather than Do Good Points, and may be responsible for issuing refunds and handling chargebacks directly with Donors.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that certain data available or otherwise accessible on or by means of the Services concerning the list of United States-based 501(c)(3) charities to which you may make a Donation is provided by a third party licensor of Do Good Points, which may be GuideStar USA, Inc., Charity Navigator Inc or another third party.
For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by you and Do Good Points, you acknowledge and agree that the third party licensor of Do Good Points (and its successors and assigns) is an intended third party beneficiary with full power and authority to enforce the provisions of these Terms only insofar as it relates to data provided by the third party licensor.
You agree that Do Good Points may share any information provided by you with the third party licensor to the extent that the third party licensor reasonably needs such data to enforce its rights related to your use of any third party licensor Data.</li>
<li>If you are the authorized representative of a Charity, and you do not wish for your Charity to appear in the Do Good Points searchable database, you may contact us at charity-am@dogoodpoints.com to request that your Charity be removed from our database.
Your email should include your full name, title, and an email address and phone number associated with your Charity.
Please note that if your Charity is removed from the Do Good Points’s database, it will not be eligible to receive contributions through the Platform.</li>
<li>Receiving Funds.
As a Charity, receipt of Donations, minus any applicable Payment Processor Fees, is based upon and subject to you providing and making available accurate and current bank account information.
Funds will generally only be disbursed to the financial institution of the registered Charity and not directly to any individual Campaign Organizer or representative agent of the Charity.</li>
<li>Do Good Points does not withhold funds for tax purposes or otherwise.
Charities will be solely responsible for taxes based on applicable international, federal, state, local or any other taxes or levies, or for any applicable taxes based on their net income or gross receipts (if any).
It is the responsibility of each Charity to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the Donations received through their use of the Services.
It is solely the responsibility of each Charity to assess, collect, report or remit the correct tax, if any, to the appropriate tax authority.</li>

Do Good Points uses third-party payment processing partners to bill you through your Payment Instrument and Billing Account for any Donations made, and Donors acknowledge that by contributing a Donation to a Campaign, the Donor agrees to the processing, use, transfer or disclosure of data by our Payment Processors pursuant to any and all applicable terms set forth by our payment partners (currently, Stripe, Inc., and Givinga Inc.
DBA Givinga Foundation), in addition to these Terms of Service, including Stripe’s terms of service, and Givinga Fund’s terms of service.</p>
<p>Recurring Donations: Donors may have the option to contribute recurring period Donations (your agreement to make the Donations on a recurring basis, a “Donation Subscription” and each individual Donation made in connection with a Donation Subscription, a “Donation Installment”), and in electing to contribute on a recurring basis, you, as a Donor hereby acknowledge that Donation Subscriptions automatically renew and have a recurring payment feature, and that unless and until you opt out of the auto-renewal of the Donation Subscription, which can be done through the Platform, any Donation Subscriptions you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the initial term originally selected.
In connection with each of your Donation Subscriptions, you (i) hereby authorize Do Good Points to bill your Payment Instrument in the amount of the applicable Donation Installments in advance on a periodic basis until you terminate such periodic payments by opting out of the Donation Subscription, (ii) accept responsibility for payment of all Donation Installments occurring prior to opt out and (iii) agree to promptly update your Billing Account with any changes (for example, any changes related to your Payment Instrument, such as a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date).
Changes to or termination of Donation Subscriptions or Donation Installments will apply only to Donation Installments that take place after Do Good Points receives notice of such change or termination.
Do Good Points may provide refunds of any amounts received in connection with previously made Donation Installments on a case by case basis at the sole discretion of Do Good Points.
Additionally, by enrolling in any Donation Subscriptions, you acknowledge and agree for any and all such Donation Subscriptions, that (a) individual Donation Installments may not be tax deductible, even if previous Donation Installments for the same Donation Subscription were, and the amount of each Donation Installment that is tax deductible may vary, (b) one or more specific Donation Installment may not be provided to or received by the applicable cause, Charity or Campaign if such cause, Charity or Campaign becomes unavailable, unable to accept Donations, or chooses to stop receiving Donations, which may occur for various reasons, such as if the cause, Charity or Campaign becomes subject to an investigation or is suspended or removed from the Services by Do Good Points or (c) the amounts actually received by the applicable Campaign, Charity or cause may differ from one Donation Installment to the next (for example, if the Payment Processor fees associated with the Donation Installment change).
If you have questions about our refund policy, you can email support@dogoodpoints.com.</p>
<p>Your non-termination of a Donation Subscription reaffirms that Do Good Points is authorized to charge your Payment Instrument for the Donation Subscription in accordance with these terms.
This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.</p>
<p>Good Points Loyalty Program: While Do Good Points does not provide any offers, promises, rewards or promotions in exchange for Donations, Users on the Do Good Points Platform are eligible to earn “Good Points.” In order to be eligible for the Good Points Loyalty Program (the “Program”), Users must have a registered account on the Do Good Points Platform.
Multiple accounts may not be merged or transferred.
By participating in this Program you are agreeing to these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Good Points may be earned by completing certain eligible actions on the Do Good Points Platform.
Examples of such eligible actions may include creating an account, donating cash or points, sharing cause, content and organization information, subscribing to a newsletter, sharing your donation and more.</p>
<p>Good Points earned for a Donation made may be revoked in the case that the Donation is later refunded or reversed for other reasons.
Good Points may also be revoked where Do Good Points believes in its discretion that Good Points were earned through or in connection with any fraud, abuse of the Platform, or violation of the Do Good Points Terms of Service.</p>
<p>When a minimum of Good Points have been accrued by a User, those Good Points may become convertible to a minimum required donation to a Charity or cause within the Platform.
One Good Point is currently equivalent to approximately $0.002 in donation value and the current valuation is subject to change.
Good Points have no value outside of the Do Good Points Platform.
User actions may be subject to verification before their corresponding Good Points are added to a User’s account.
Good Points do not expire and are non-transferrable to any other User.
The number of Good Points required to convert to donation value may be modified by Do Good Points at any time.
Once Good Points are converted and redeemed for a Donation, they cannot be returned to your account.
If you believe there is any discrepancy in your Good Points balance, please contact our Customer Support team at support@dogoodpoints.com.
If we find that a correction is due, it may take up to four weeks.
Failure to supply necessary documentation may result in an inability to award your Good Points.</p>
<p>Participation in the Program is a benefit granted to registered Users, and as such can be suspended, revoked, or terminated at any time by us for any reason.
If your account is terminated, all Good Points associated with your account will be forfeited immediately upon termination.
If your account is terminated due to fraudulent activity or noncompliance with these Terms of Service, in addition to forfeiting all Good Points immediately, you cannot participate in or rejoin the Program.</p>
<p>Campaign Organizers, Charities, or Beneficiaries</p>
<p>
<strong>Account Holds: </strong>From time to time, Do Good Points may, in its sole discretion, place a hold on a Campaign account (a "Hold"), restricting Payouts (defined herein), secure reserves, or take similar actions to protect its interests and those of its Users.
Some of the reasons that we may take such actions include, but aren’t necessarily limited to, the following: (i) if we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that information provided by a Campaign Organizer is false, misleading, or fraudulent, or that funds are being used in a prohibited manner, (ii) if the funds available (as determined by Do Good Points in its sole discretion) should be provided directly to a person other than the Charity (such as a legal beneficiary or person entitled by law to act on behalf of a Charity), (iii) if we have reason to believe that a Campaign or Campaign Organizer has violated these Terms of Service, (iv) if Do Good Points determines that the Campaign Organizer is colluding with donors to engage in fraudulent activity, (v) if we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that there may be suspicious or fraudulent donation activity, or (vi) if required in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under applicable laws and regulations.
If you have questions about a Hold we may have placed on your Campaign account, or need information about how to resolve the Hold, please contact your Campaign account manager.</p>
<p>
<strong>Donation Payouts from a Campaign:</strong>While Do Good Points strives to make Payouts available to Charities promptly after the close of each quarter, you acknowledge and agree that Payouts may not be available to you for receive immediately, and Do Good Points expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any delay or inability to access and use Payouts at any specified time, and any consequences arising from such delay or inability.
You, as a Campaign Organizer, are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide to Do Good Points in order to process a Payout, including your bank account information, is accurate and up to date.
Do Good Points may, at any time, for any reason, without notice, and in its sole discretion, offer or issue a refund of Donation(s) with or without consulting with you, which may comprise the entire amount donated to your campaign.
Do Good Points is not liable to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs, losses, or other consequences caused by Do Good Points issuing refunds, including, but not limited to transaction or overdraft fees.</p>
<p>
<strong>Payment Processors:</strong>Do Good Points uses Payment Processors to process Donations for your Campaign.
By setting up a Campaign or accepting the role of Campaign Organizer, you agree to the processing, use, transfer or disclosure of data by the Payment Processors pursuant to any and all applicable terms set forth by the applicable Payment Processors (currently, Stripe, Inc.
and Givinga, Inc.
DBA GivingaFoundation), in addition to these Terms of Service, including Stripe’s terms of service and Givinga Foundation’s terms of service.</p>3.

LEGAL DISPUTES<p>ARBITRATION CLAUSE &amp.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver: YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES ACTING IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY.
DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING OUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.
(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.
(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.
or (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Process:</strong> Any arbitration between you and us will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms of Service.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org.</p>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.
Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”).
Our current address for Notice is: Do Good, Inc., ℅ Legal Department, PO Box 193446, San Francisco, CA 94119.
The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
We agree to work with you and make a good faith effort to resolve the claim directly, but if we aren’t successful within 60 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.
All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either of us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
If the arbitrator awards you an amount which exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator.
or (ii) $10,000.00.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Fees:</b> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for more than $10,000 in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearing will take place at an agreed upon location in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(b) through a telephone hearing or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address.
If the arbitration finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</li>
<li>No Class Actions: YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
<li>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision: If we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with us will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
</li>
<li>Enforceability: If this Disputes section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the General section below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Confidentiality:</b> We each agree to keep the arbitration proceedings, all information exchanged between us, and any settlement offers confidential, unless otherwise required by law or requested by law enforcement or any court or governmental body.
However, we may each disclose these matters, in confidence, to our respective accountants, auditors, and insurance providers.</p>9.
TERMINATIONYou agree that Do Good Points, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or your access to the Services and remove and discard any User Content or data at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, and without any liability to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs or losses resulting therefrom.10.
USER DISPUTESYou agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Services and Do Good Points will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.
Do Good Points reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Services.11.
GENERAL<p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Do Good Points and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and Do Good Points with respect to the Services.
You also may be subject to additional terms of service that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software.
These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Do Good Points agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California.
The failure of Do Good Points to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be (or are otherwise) invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Do Good Points, but Do Good Points may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.
If we fail to enforce any of our rights, that does not result in a waiver of that right.
The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.
The Services may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Platforms.
Do Good Points may, at any time, assign our rights or delegate our obligations hereunder without notice to you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of equity or assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
