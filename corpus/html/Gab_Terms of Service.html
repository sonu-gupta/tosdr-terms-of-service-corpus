<br>User Contributions<p>The Website may contain message boards, chat rooms, personal web pages or profiles, forums, bulletin boards, group pages, discussion threads, and other interactive features (collectively, “Interactive Services”) that allow users to post, submit, publish, display, or transmit to other users or other persons (hereinafter, “post”) content or materials (collectively, “User Contributions”) on or through the Website.</p>
<p>All User Contributions must comply with the Content Standards set out in these Terms of Service.
Any User Contribution you post to the site will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary.
By providing any User Contribution on the Website, you grant us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our licensees, successors, and assigns an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free right to use, republish, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such material for any purpose.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You own or control all rights in and to the User Contributions and have the right to grant the license granted above to us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of your User Contributions do and will comply with these Terms of Service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any User Contributions you submit or contribute, and you, not the Company, have full responsibility for such content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness.</p>
<p>We are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Contributions posted by you or any other user of the Website.</p>
<br>Monitoring and Enforcement.
Termination<p>We strive to ensure that the First Amendment remains the Website’s standard for content moderation.
We will make best efforts to ensure that all content moderation decisions and enforcement of these terms of service does not punish users for exercising their God-given right to speak freely.</p>
<p>We collect comparatively little data on our users relative to other social networking sites.
Our default position is that we should implement no prior restraints on any User Contribution.
However, given the breadth of speech we permit, there may be circumstances where we are unable to determine whether content is protected by the First Amendment or not and prudence may require us to err on the side of caution.
Accordingly, the Company reserves the right to take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Contribution violates the Terms of Service, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, or could threaten the physical safety of users of the Website or the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Website or in cases of life-threatening emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Website for any violation of these Terms of Service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your access to the Website is terminated or suspended in relation to a User Contribution authored by you that you believe constitutes protected political or religious speech, and you are able to demonstrate that the User Contribution in question was protected by the First Amendment by obtaining a declaratory judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction, the company will consider permitting you to re-join the site.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Company to not provide any user data to any person unless compelled by a court order issued by a U.S.
court, except in cases of life-threatening emergency.
The Company reserves the right to change or deviate from this policy at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion, with or without notice to you.
Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to cooperate fully with any law enforcement authorities or civil and criminal court orders requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through the Website.
YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.</p>
<p>We do not review material before it is posted on the Website and cannot ensure prompt removal of unlawful material after it has been posted.
Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party.
We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.</p>
<br>Content Standards<p>These Content Standards apply to any and all User Contributions and use of Interactive Services.</p>
<p>As a general rule, written expression that is protected political, religious, symbolic, or commercial speech under the First Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution will be allowed on the Website.
User Contributions absolutely must in their entirety comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations in the United States.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, User Contributions must NOT:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be unlawful or be made in furtherance of any unlawful purpose.
User Contributions must not aid, abet, assist, counsel, procure or solicit the commission of, nor constitute an attempt or part of a conspiracy to commit, any unlawful act.
For avoidance of doubt, speech which is merely offensive or the expression of an offensive or controversial idea or opinion, as a general rule, will be in poor taste but will not be illegal in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlawfully threaten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incite imminent lawless action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interfere with the operation of any computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be obscene, sexually explicit or pornographic.
Note that mere nudity e.g.
as a form of protest or for educational/medical reasons will not fall foul of this rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property or other rights of any other person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violate the legal rights (including the rights of publicity and privacy) of others or contain any material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under applicable laws or regulations of the United States or that otherwise may be in conflict with these Terms of Service and our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impersonate any person, or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or organization, for a purpose not protected by the First Amendment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involve commercial activities relating to finance, investments or gambling, such as contests and sweepstakes, penny stock promotion, money transmission, or Initial Coin Offerings.
or the trade of live or endangered animals or animal parts, or anything that portrays or encourages the abuse of animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the impression that they emanate from or are endorsed by us or any other person or entity, if this is not the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link to any content from the above-listed categories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although our Content Standards, following the First Amendment, do not proscribe offensive speech, we strongly encourage you to ensure that your User Contributions are cordial and civil.
The foundation of a free society requires people to peacefully settle their differences through dialogue and debate.
Gab exists to promote the free flow of information online.
It is our view that the responsible exercise of one’s free speech rights is its own reward and, as a general rule, the most well-respected online publishers tend to be the ones who behave the most civilly and put forward their arguments most intelligently.</p>
<br>Copyright Infringement<p>If you believe that any User Contributions violate your copyright, please see our&nbsp;Copyright Policy&nbsp;for instructions on sending us a notice of copyright infringement.
It is the policy of the Company to terminate the user accounts of repeat infringers.</p>
