</ul> Best Practices <p>As a marketing platform with millions of customers all over the world, we feel it’s our responsibility to be extra vigilant in preventing abuse of our services to protect both our customers and their contacts.
It’s also in our best interest to keep the platform clean because our reputation and deliverability depend on it.
