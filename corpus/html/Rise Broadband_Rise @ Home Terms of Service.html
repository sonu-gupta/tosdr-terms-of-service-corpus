CUSTOMER AGREES THAT CUSTOMER AND RISE BROADBAND ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice (“Arbitration Notice”).
An Arbitration Notice to Rise Broadband must be addressed to Rise Broadband at 61 Inverness Drive East, Suite 250, Englewood, CO 80112.
An Arbitration Notice to Customer must be addressed to Customer at Customer’s then-current billing address.
The Arbitration Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If Customer and Rise Broadband do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 calendar days after the Arbitration Notice is received, Customer or Rise Broadband may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Rise Broadband or Customer shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which Customer or Rise Broadband is entitled.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), as modified by these Service Terms, and shall be administered by the AAA.
The arbitrator shall be bound by these Service Terms.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are reserved to the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Unless Customer and Rise Broadband agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings shall take place in Arapahoe County, Colorado.
The right to a hearing shall be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
The party initiating arbitration proceedings shall bear all the arbitration-related costs and expenses of both parties including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses.</p>
<p>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
CUSTOMER AND RISE BROADBAND AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both Customer and Rise Broadband agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Service Terms to the contrary, Customer and Rise Broadband agree that if Rise Broadband makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the address to which an Arbitration Notice is to be sent), Customer may reject any such change by sending Rise Broadband written notice within 30 days of the change.
By rejecting any future change, Customer agrees that Customer will arbitrate any dispute between Customer and Rise Broadband in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>
LAWS
<p>These Service Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, excluding its conflict of law provisions.
Customer and Rise Broadband agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Arapahoe County, Colorado.
If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties with the other provisions remaining in full force and effect.
Customer and Rise Broadband agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose.
otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>
PHONE CALLS
<p>Rise Broadband, its agent or subcontractor may call Customer from time to time at the phone number Customer provides as part of its delivery of the Services.
Calls may be live or pre-recorded and made via automated dialing systems.
Voice and Data rates may apply.</p>
