It is also evaluated to make the website user-friendly and to ensure stability and security.
For this purpose, we partly use the external web hosting service providers Fastly, Inc.

The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.
</p> b) Cookies and similar technologies <p> We also use “cookies” on our sites.
Cookies are small text files that are assigned to your browser and stored on your device.
Through them, certain information flows to the place that sets the cookie, such as settings or data for exchange with the system.
This helps us to make our website more user-friendly and effective overall.
The legal bases for this are your consent and our legitimate interests.
Cookies cannot execute programs or transmit viruses to your device.
</p>
<p> We use session cookies, persistent cookies, and third-party cookies.
</p>
<p> Session cookies&nbsp;store what’s called a session ID, which can be used to assign different requests of your browser to a common session.
This allows your device to be recognized when you return to our website.
For example, this lets you store certain information you have entered (such as log-in information, language settings) in such a way that you do not have to repeat it constantly.
Session cookies are automatically deleted when you log out or close your browser.
</p>
<p> Persistent cookies&nbsp;remain on your device for the time being, so that we can recognize your browser on your next visit and we can, for example, assign your preferred information and settings.
Long-term cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may vary depending on the cookie.
</p>
<p> When you visit our website, our partner companies also store&nbsp;third-party cookies&nbsp;on your device.
The cookies contain information about how our website is used, e.g.
which pages and products were visited.
The data is collected in a pseudonymized form by assigning an identification number, which is not combined with any other personal data you may have provided to us.
</p>
<p> You can delete cookies in your browser settings at any time or prevent them from being stored, although the latter may result in a restriction of the functionality of our website for you.
In the relevant sections of this Privacy Policy, we explain which technologies that are comparable to cookies are used on our website and how you can object to the use of cookies and other technologies with the individual third-party providers.<br>
<br>
</p> 2.2 Ordering from Spreadshirt / User Account <p> a) If you want to order something in our online shop, it is necessary for the conclusion of the contract that you give us the personal data we need to process the order.
The mandatory data required to process the contract is marked as such.
all other data you provide is voluntary.
You can either enter your data only once for the order or use your email address to set up a password-protected user account with us, in which your data can be stored for later purchases until you revoke your consent.
You can deactivate or delete the data and the user account at any time via the account.
</p>
<p> To prevent unauthorized access to your personal data by third parties, the order process is encrypted using TLS technology.
</p>
<p> When we process the data provided by you to process your order, this includes, for example, individual customer service.
In the course of order processing, we pass on personal data to one of our production companies within the group, to a shipping company commissioned by us and (with the exception of PayPal) to our bank, ADYEN B.V., Simon Carmiggeltstraat 6-50, 1011 DJ Amsterdam, Netherlands (“Adyen”).
The payment data is encrypted and transmitted directly to Adyen.
</p>
<p> Payment via PayPal is processed by PayPal, 2211 North First Street San Jose, California 95131 (“PayPal”).
For information about data protection at PayPal, please refer to PayPal’s privacy policy:&nbsp;https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.
</p>
<p> In the case of trackable parcels, we also pass on your order and address data to parcelLab GmbH, Landwehrstraße 39, 80336 Munich, Germany, to make it possible to track your parcel and to inform you about delivery deviations or delays, for example.

Our aim in this regard is to prevent any abuse of your chosen payment method by third parties and to protect ourselves from payment defaults.
The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.
</p>
<p> Since this involves automated decision-making, you have the right to challenge the decision (in this case the refusal of a certain payment method) and have the decision reviewed by a person.
In such cases we ask that you contact us using the contact details mentioned in Section 1.
Please note that the payment method may have been rejected due to a typing error and you should, therefore, check what you have entered again during the order process if necessary.

<p> c) During the ordering process we use Google Maps Autocomplete, a service of Google LLC (“Google”).
This allows an address you start typing to be completed automatically, avoiding delivery errors.

You can unsubscribe from the Partner Newsletter at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each email, informing us via the contact details specified in Section 1, or changing your newsletter settings in your user account (“Account Settings” – “Newsletter subscriptions”).
</p>
<p> When sending the Partner Newsletter, we use Emarsys to statistically evaluate your user behavior in order to optimize the design.

The links contained in the email also contain this ID.
For example, we can see if and when an email has been opened and which links have been clicked on.
The data is stored on the Emarsys servers for 13 months and collected pseudonymously, meaning the IDs are not linked to other personal data at this point, thus ruling out any possibility of direct personal reference.

On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide us with other services relating to website and internet use.
</p>
<p> The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data held by Google.

The opt-out cookie is set per top-level domain, per browser and per device and only prevents the recording of data for this website.
</p>
<p> This website uses Google Analytics with the “_anonymizeIp()” extension.
Consequently, IP addresses are further processed in shortened form, so that any personal association with the data subject can be ruled out.
As far as the data collected about you relates to you personally, that association is therefore ruled out immediately and the personal data thus erased without delay.
</p>
<p> We use Google Analytics to analyze and regularly improve the use of our website.

This means that after you register we will send you an email to the email address you provided, in which we ask you to confirm that you would like to receive the newsletter.
If you do not confirm your registration, your information will be automatically deleted after one month.
On the other hand, if you confirm the newsletter subscription, we will save your email address for the purpose of sending you the newsletter until you unsubscribe from the newsletter.

</p> b) Product recommendations <p> As a Spreadshirt customer, i.e., if you order something in our online shop (see Section 2.2 a), we process the email address you provide in order to send you regular email recommendations for products that might be of interest to you based on your previous orders from us.
We also use your name to allow us to personalize these emails.
The data is passed on to the software company Emarsys (see Section 2.6 a), which handles the technical side of the mailing on our behalf.
The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.
</p>
<p> You receive these product recommendations because you did not object to the use of your email address for this purpose by removing the corresponding check mark during the order process.
If you subsequently no longer wish to receive product recommendations or any advertising messages, you can object at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs at the basic rates.
Just click on the unsubscribe link included with each email, send a message using the contact details provided under Section 1 or – if you have a user account with us – adjust your newsletter settings accordingly (“Account settings” - “Newsletter subscriptions”).
</p>
<p> When sending the product recommendations, we use Emarsys to statistically evaluate your user behavior in order to measure their success and to optimize their design.
The legal bases for the processing are your consent and our legitimate interests.
To enable this evaluation, the emails contain what are called web beacons or tracking pixels.
These are single-pixel image files that establish a connection to our website und thus permit a log file analysis.
The web beacons are linked with the data mentioned in Section 2.1 a and an individual ID.
The links contained in the email also contain this ID.
For example, we can see if and when an email has been opened and which links have been clicked on.
The data is stored on the Emarsys servers for 13 months and collected pseudonymously, meaning the IDs are not linked to other personal data at this point, thus ruling out any possibility of direct personal reference.
You can object to the recording of your usage behavior at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each email, informing us via the contact options listed in Section 1, or – if you have a user account with us – changing the newsletter settings in your user account (“Account settings” – “Newsletter subscriptions”).
Recording is not possible if you have disabled the display of images in your email settings.
In this case, the newsletter will not be displayed to you in full and you may not be able to use all functions.
If you choose to display the images manually, recording will take place as described above.
</p> c) Newsletters and product recommendations from Spreadshirt Shop Partners <p> In exceptional cases where you register separately in a Spreadshirt shop for a Shop Partner’s newsletter and thus give your consent, we transmit your email address to the Shop Partner so that it can send you emails on product offers, discounts and contests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You can revoke your consent to the sending of the newsletter at any time (without this affecting the lawfulness of the processing up to the point of revocation).
This revocation must be declared vis-à-vis the Shop Partner.
The contact details of the respective Shop Partner can be found in the legal information section of their Spreadshirt shop.</strong>
</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing is your consent.</p> d) Postal Advertisements <p> We would like to occasionally inform you about new products, deals, and contests and may use your name and address to send you postal mail.
In this case we share your name and address our selected shipping or mailing provider.
The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.
You may object to the use of your personal information for this purposes anytime by notifying us at the contact information provided in Section 1.
</p> 2.7 Usage-based online advertising <p> Our website uses various conversion tracking and retargeting technologies made available by other service providers.
We use these technologies to make our website interesting for you.
The information also helps us to address users who have already shown an interest in our products with individually tailored advertising on the websites of our partner companies.
We assume that the display of personalized, interest-based advertising is generally more interesting for the internet user than advertising that has no such personal relevance.
At the same time, we want to avoid inappropriate and intrusive advertising.
</p>
<p> General information about third-party advertising-based technologies and how to disable them can be found on the following websites, among others: </p>
<ul>
<li> Your Online Choices:&nbsp;http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ </li>
<li> YourAdChoices:&nbsp;http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/ </li>
<li> Network Advertising Initiative:&nbsp;http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/ </li>
</ul> a) Use of Google Ads conversion tracking and Google Ads remarketing <p> We use Google Ads, a service of Google LLC (“Google”), to use ads to draw attention to our offers on external websites.
In relation to the data of advertising campaigns, we can identify how successful the individual advertising activities are.
In this way we want to show you advertising that is of interest to you, make our website more attractive to you and achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.
</p>
<p> These ads are deployed by Google via ‘ad servers’.
For this purpose, we use ad server cookies, which enable the tracking of certain parameters for measuring success, such as the display of ads or clicks by users.
If you arrive at our website via a Google ad, Google Ads will store a cookie on your device.
These cookies usually expire after 30 days and are not intended to identify you personally.
Analysis values usually stored for this cookie are the unique cookie ID, the number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), the last impression (relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (marker showing that the user no longer wishes to be targeted).
</p>
<p> These cookies allow Google to recognize your internet browser.
If a user visits certain pages of a Google Ads customer’s website (in this case ours) and the cookie stored on their device has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this site.
Each Google Ads customer is assigned a different cookie.
Cookies cannot therefore be tracked via the websites of Google Ads customers.
We do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising activities.
Google merely provides us with statistical evaluations.
On the basis of these evaluations we can identify which of the advertising activities used are particularly effective.
We do not receive any further data from the use of ads.
in particular we cannot identify users on the basis of this information.
</p>
<p> Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server.
We have no influence on the extent and further processing of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to what we know: By integrating Google Ads Conversion, Google receives the information that you have retrieved the corresponding part of our website, or that you have clicked on one of our ads.
If you are registered with a Google service, Google can associate the visit with your account.
Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, it is possible that Google will obtain and store your IP address.
</p>
<p>- Google Ads remarketing</p>
<p> Besides Google Ads Conversion, we also use Google’s remarketing feature.
This is a process we use in an attempt to contact you again.
After visiting our website, this feature makes it possible to show you our ads when you continue to use the internet.
This is done by means of cookies stored in your browser, which Google uses to record and evaluate your usage behavior when visiting various websites.
This is how Google can determine that you have previously visited our website.
According to its own information, Google does not combine the data collected in the context of remarketing with your personal data, which may be processed by Google.
Specifically, according to Google, pseudonymization is used during remarketing.
</p>
<p> There are various ways in which you can prevent your participation in this tracking procedure: </p>
<ul>
<li> By setting your browser software accordingly.
in particular, disabling cookies from third party providers means that you will not receive any ads from third-party providers.
</li>
<li> By permanent deactivation in your browser Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome via the link:&nbsp;https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996?hl=en.
Please note that by doing this you may not be able to properly use the full functionality of our website.
</li>
<li> By clicking on the following button:&nbsp;Disable Enable Google Ads.
This will place an opt-out cookie which prevents recording when you visit our website in future.
Please note that if you delete all cookies on your device, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted.
in this case, if you still wish to object then you must place the cookie again using the above button.
The opt-out cookie is set per top-level domain, per browser and per device and only prevents the recording of data for this website.
</li>
<li> By disabling interest-based ads from providers who are part of the “YourAdChoices” self-regulation initiative via the link&nbsp;http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/.
please note that this setting will be erased if you erase your cookies.

</p> b) Use of Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Website Custom Audiences and Facebook Conversion Tracking <p>- Facebook Custom Audiences</p>
<p> Our website also uses the Website Custom Audiences remarketing function of Facebook, Inc.
(“Facebook”).
This allows users of the website to see interest-based ads (“Facebook Ads”) when visiting the social network Facebook or other websites that also use the process.
Our intention here is to show you ads that are of interest to you.
</p>
<p> Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Facebook server.
We have no influence on the extent and further processing of the data collected by Facebook through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to what we know: By integrating Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook receives the information that you have retrieved the corresponding part of our website, or that you have clicked on one of our ads.
If you are registered with a Facebook service, Facebook can associate the visit with your account.
Even if you are not registered with Facebook or have not logged in, it is possible that Facebook will obtain and store your IP address and other identifying information.
</p>
<p>- Facebook Website Custom Audiences</p>
<p> Our website also uses the Facebook product “Custom Audiences from your website”.
For this purpose, we have integrated remarketing tags (so-called Facebook Pixel or web beacon) into our website.
The Facebook Pixel is a small piece of JavaScript code that provides a range of functionalities for sending application-specific events and user-defined data to Facebook.
We use the Facebook Pixel to track how visitors use our site.
The Facebook Pixel records and reports to Facebook information about the user’s browser session, a hashed version of the Facebook ID, and the URL being viewed.
Every Facebook user therefore has a device-independent Facebook ID, which enables us to recognize users across multiple devices on the social network Facebook so that we can use Facebook Ads to reach our visitors again for advertising purposes.
After 180 days, the user information is deleted until the user returns to our website.
No personal information is transmitted to us about individual website visitors, and we can only specifically deploy ads to website custom audiences if the custom audience has reached a critical size.
This makes it impossible for us to determine the individual identities of visitors.
</p>
<p>- Facebook Conversion Tracking</p>
<p> We also use the Facebook Pixel on our website to measure the reach of ads.
This allows us to track users’ actions after they have seen or clicked on a Facebook Ad.
The Facebook Pixel records and reports to Facebook information about the user’s browser session, a hashed version of the Facebook ID, and the URL being viewed.
The way it works is comparable to Facebook Website Custom Audiences via the Facebook Pixel, which is already described above.
Using the hashed Facebook ID, we can measure the reach and effectiveness of an ad to find out whether you are actually interested in our advertising.
This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook Ads for statistical and market research purposes.
For us, the data used is not personally identifiable.
</p>
<p> You can prevent Facebook from recording your data on this website by clicking here:&nbsp;Disable Enable Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Website Custom Audiences and Facebook Conversion Tracking.
This will place an opt-out cookie which prevents recording when you visit our website in future.
Please note that if you delete all cookies on your device, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted.
in this case, if you still wish to object then you must place the cookie again using the above button.
The opt-out cookie is set per top-level domain, per browser and per device and only prevents the recording of data for this website.
How to prevent the recording of your data on other websites is explained on the respective sites, and if you are a user who has logged in to Facebook, here:&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_.
</p>
<p> The legal bases for the processing of data when using the functions specified above are your consent and our legitimate interests.

<p> Third-party provider information: Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA.
For more information about data processing by Facebook, please refer to Facebook’s privacy policy:&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.
</p> c) Use of LinkedIn conversion tracking and retargeting <p>- LinkedIn conversion tracking</p>
<p> Our website uses the feature “LinkedIn conversion tracking” from LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn”) to measure the reach of ads.
This is to determine how successful individual advertising activities are on LinkedIn.
Our intention here is to develop and display advertising that is of interest to you and make our website more attractive.
For this purpose, the LinkedIn Insight Tag is integrated into our website.
This JavaScript code enables LinkedIn to use cookies to collect pseudonymous data about your visit and the use of our website (e.g.
about the browser session and the website displayed) and to provide us with aggregated, non-personal statistics on this basis.
This allows us to trace the actions that have taken place after a LinkedIn ad has been viewed or clicked on.
</p>
<p>- LinkedIn website retargeting</p>
<p> Our website also uses the “LinkedIn website retargeting” feature.
After visiting our website, this feature makes it possible to show you our ads when you continue to use the internet.
Our intention here is to show you ads that are of interest to you.
This is done by means of a cookie stored in your browser (see above for more information), which is used to record and evaluate your usage behavior.
No personal information is transmitted to us about individual website visitors, and we can only specifically deploy ads to website custom audiences if the custom audience has reached a critical size.
This makes it impossible for us to determine the individual identities of visitors.
</p>
<p> There are various ways in which you can disable this tracking.
You can adjust your browser settings to prevent the storage of cookies, although this may result in a restriction of the functionality of our website for you.
You also can prevent LinkedIn from recording your data on this website by clicking here:&nbsp;Disable Enable LinkedIn conversion tracking and website retargeting.
This will place an opt-out cookie which prevents recording when you visit our website in future.
Please note that if you delete all cookies on your device, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted.
in this case, if you still wish to object then you must place the cookie again using the above button.
The opt-out cookie is set per top-level domain, per browser and per device and only prevents the recording of data for this website.
In addition, you can disable interest-based ads from providers who are part of the “YourAdChoices” self-regulation initiative (http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/) or e.g.
part of the Network Advertising Initiative (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/).
please note that this setting will be erased if you erase your cookies.

</p> d) Use of Bing Ads Conversion Tracking and remarketing <p>- Bing Ads Conversion Tracking</p>
<p> Our website also uses the “Bing Ads Conversion Tracking” feature from Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") to measure the reach of ads.
This is to determine how successful our individual advertising activities are on Bing and Yahoo.
Our intention here is to develop and display advertising that is of interest to you and make our website more attractive.
For this purpose, Microsoft’s UET tag (Universal Event Tracking tag) is integrated into our website.
This JavaScript code enables Microsoft to use cookies to collect pseudonymous data about your visit and the use of our website (e.g.
about the browser session and the website displayed) and to provide us with aggregated, non-personal statistics on this basis (e.g.
how many visitors have reached a particular target page).
This allows us to trace the actions that have taken place after an ad has been viewed or clicked on Bing or Yahoo.
</p>
<p>- Bing Ads remarketing</p>
<p> Our online offering also uses the “Bing Ads remarketing” feature.
After visiting our website, this feature allows us to show you our ads when you continue to use the internet.
Our intention here is to show you ads that are of interest to you.
This is done by means of a cookie stored in your browser (see above for more information), which is used to record and evaluate your usage behavior.
No personal information is transmitted to us about individual website visitors, and we can only specifically deploy ads to website custom audiences if the custom audience has reached a critical size.
This makes it impossible for us to determine the individual identities of visitors.

</p> e) Use of Webgains tracking <p> In addition, we use a plug-in of the international affiliate network Webgains, which is provided by ad pepper media GmbH (“Webgains”).
This enables us to measure the success of our ads on partner sites brokered for us by Webgains.
In this way we want to show you advertising that is of interest to you, make our website more attractive to you and achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.
For this purpose, a tracking code is integrated into our site.
This code enables Webgains to collect pseudonymous data about your visit and the use of our online offer via cookies and make aggregated, non-personal statistics available to us on this basis, in particular about how many visitors of a certain partner site have ordered something from us after clicking on our advertisement.

</p> f) Use of features by Spreadshirt’s Shop Partners <p> Our partners can also use a Facebook Pixel (see Section 2.7 b for a detailed explanation) in their Spreadshirt shops themselves, as a rule in order to be able to show you advertising on Facebook that is of interest to you after your visit to their shop, or in order to measure the reach of ads and in turn make their products more attractive.
In this case, they determine the purposes and means of processing personal data.
The name and contact details of our partners are stored in the legal information section of the respective shop.
</p> g) ShareASale <p> Our website uses tracking features from ShareASale, Inc.
to identify the referrers of new Spreadshirt Shop Owners.
This is to be able to credit referrers who introduce new people to our Spreadshop service.

</p> 2.8.
Processing of personal data when using our mobile partner app <p> If you are a partner of ours, we will provide you with a mobile app (hereinafter referred to as "SpreadApp") in addition to our online service that you can use to get an overview of your partner statistics (credits, sales and bestsellers) at any time.
</p> a) Processing of personal data when using our SpreadApp <p>- Log-in</p>
<p> In order to connect your mobile device to your Spreadshirt user account via the SpreadApp, it is either necessary for you to use your smartphone camera to scan the QR code displayed or to enter your Spreadshirt user name or e-mail address and password in the input screen provided.
The legal basis for processing the data is to perform under a contract.
</p>
<p>- App permissions and notifications</p>
<p> If you allow this on your mobile device, SpreadApp has the authorization to access your camera.
This enables you to connect your mobile device to your user account by scanning a QR code.
If you allow this on your mobile device, you will also receive notifications from SpreadApp (e.g.
about new sales).
You can manage these types of access at any time on your mobile device in the system settings.
SpreadApp can also be used without the functions.
The legal basis for the processing is your consent.
</p>
<p>- Display of information from the Spreadshirt user account</p>
<p> The SpreadApp reads out and displays the following information from your user account: Your username, the user account number, your credit balance, an overview of your sales and your bestselling products and designs.
This is necessary for the implementation of the amended contract that exists with you as our partner.
The legal basis for the processing is to perform under a contract.
</p>
<p>- Log files</p>
<p> When using the SpreadApp, we also process personal data mentioned below.
These are technically necessary for us to enable you to use the functions of the app comfortably and to guarantee stability and security (legal bases are to perform under a contract and our legitimate interests): </p>
<ul>
<li>IP address,</li>
<li>date and time of the request,</li>
<li>content of the request (concrete page),</li>
<li>page from which the request comes,</li>
<li>access status/HTTP status code,</li>
<li>the amount of data transferred in each case,</li>
<li>browser,</li>
<li>language and version of the browser software,</li>
<li>operating system and its interface,</li>
<li>device identification,</li>
<li>type and name of your mobile device,</li>
<li>screen size and resolution,</li>
<li>country and city,</li>
<li>version of the app,</li>
<li>number of your Spreadshirt user account.</li>
</ul> b) Processing of Personal Information for Application Analysis <p> In addition to processing the aforementioned data, a technology comparable to cookies is used for your use of SpreadApp.
By the use of JavaScript code, counting impulses are transmitted to counting servers of the service providers listed below.
This information enables us to analyze how you use our SpreadApp.
You can prevent this usage information from being collected by deactivating the "I'm in" button when you install the SpreadApp or by deactivating the "App analysis" button in the "Settings" section of your SpreadApp later on.
</p>
<p>- Google Analytics</p>
<p> The SpreadApp uses Google Analytics, an analysis service of Google LLC ("Google").
The information generated by the JavaScript code about your usage is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there for 26 months.
Due to the activation of IP anonymization in the SpreadApp, your IP address will be shortened by Google.
On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate how you use the SpreadApp in order to compile reports on app activity and to provide us with other services relating to the app use.
The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other data from Google.
SpreadApp uses Google Analytics with the extension "_anonymizeIp()".
This means that IP addresses are shortened for further processing, so that it is not possible to identify individuals.
If the data collected about you is related to your person, it is excluded immediately, and the personal data is deleted immediately.
We use Google Analytics to analyze and improve the use of SpreadApp on a regular basis.
The statistics obtained enable us to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.
The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is our legitimate interests.
</p>
<p> Third-party information: Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

</p>
<p>- Adobe Analytics</p>
<p> Our SpreadApp also uses the Adobe Analytics analysis service to analyze and regularly improve the use of SpreadApp.
The statistics obtained enable us to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.
The legal basis for the use of Adobe Analytics is our legitimate interests.
Our website uses Adobe Analytics with the settings “Before Geo-Lookup: Replace visitor’s last IP octet with 0” and “Obfuscate IP-Removed”, which removes the last octet from your IP address and replaces it with a generic IP address, i.e.
one that can no longer be assigned.
Any personal connection can therefore be ruled out.
The usage information is stored for 25 months.

</p>
<p>- Sentry</p>
<p> SpreadApp also uses the "Sentry" service of the provider Functional Software, Inc.
The service detects and documents errors and performance problems that may occur during your use of SpreadApp.
We use the service to improve the technical stability of SpreadApp by monitoring system stability and detecting code errors.
The data (e.g.
information about the device or time of error) is collected anonymously, is not used for personal purposes and stored for 90 days.
The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.

What are my rights? <p> If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, you can revoke this consent with future effect at any time.
This does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out on the basis of the consent before you revoke your consent.
</p>
<p> If we base the processing of your personal data on our legitimate interests, you are entitled to object to the processing.
This is the case if the processing is not necessary in particular for the performance of a contract with you, which was described by us in each case with the description of the individual functions.
When exercising such a right of objection, we ask that you explain the reasons why we should not process your personal data as carried out by us.
In the event that your objection is justified, we will examine the situation and either stop or adjust the data processing or point out to you the compelling legitimate reasons on the basis of which we will continue processing.
</p>
<p> However, you can of course object to the processing of your personal data for advertising or web analytics purposes at any time without giving reasons.
</p>
<p> As described in the relevant sections, we sometimes use external service providers to process your data.
These have been carefully selected and commissioned by us, are bound by our instructions and are regularly checked.
</p>
<p> The personal data processed by us is generally erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply.
Data may be stored for a longer period if this has been provided for by laws or other rules to which we as the controller are subject.
The data will also be blocked or erased once a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or performance of a contract.
</p>
<p> Further processing operations may be required for contests and other promotional campaigns.
In such cases we will inform you in the context of the respective promotional campaign.

<p> f) How to Submit Verified Requests<br>
<br> To submit a request for information or deletion, please e-mail&nbsp;info@spreadshirt.com<br> or call 1-800-381-0815.<br>
<br> Your request will be processed only if we can verify that you are the person whose personal information is the subject of the request.
If we cannot verify your identity, we will ask you to provide corrected verification information, or we will deny the request to the extent necessary.<br>
<br> If you request a deletion of your personal information, you will be required to confirm this deletion separately via e-mail.<br>
<br> All requests must be verified, meaning that we must determine that the consumer making the request is the same consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
Verification methods will vary depending on the request, the sensitivity of the personal information that is the subject of the request, and our ability to associate the provided verification information with information in our records.<br>
<br> If you request disclosure of categories of personal information collected, used, and disclosed, then we will need to verify your identity by reference to at least two independent pieces of evidence describing different pieces of personal information that match the personal information in our records that is the subject of the request.<br>
<br> If you request disclosure of specific pieces of personal information, then we will need to verify your identity by reference to at least three independent pieces of evidence describing different pieces of personal information that match the personal information in our records that is the subject of the request.<br> If you request deletion of all or some personal information, then we will need to verify your identity by reference to at least two or three independent pieces of evidence describing different pieces of personal information that match the personal information in our records that is the subject of the request.
The specific number and type of pieces of evidence will vary depending on the sensitivity of the personal information to be deleted.<br>
<br> If you do not have an account with us or have not made a purchase with us, it is possible that we will not be able to verify your request no matter what evidence you provide because we do not have enough information in our records to ensure that the information in our records is yours.
This is because some of the personal information we gather is not identifiable with a specific individual (for example, we use a cookie which only stores which products you have recently viewed on our website so that these are shown to you at your next visit.
You can turn this feature off by clicking the “remember history” slider button in a product result page).
</p>
<p> g) Authorized Agents<br>
<br> If an authorized agent will make a request on your behalf under this section, your agent must provide a copy of the writing, signed by you, which authorizes the agent to act on your behalf, along with the same level of verification on the part of both the authorized agent and yourself which would be required of an individual acting on his or her own behalf.
