Where we collect Data/PII from <p>At present, Safing ICS Technologies GmbH runs four (4) services, these are as follows, Website, Forum, SPN, and Portmaster update server: these
services collect different levels of data, however we aim to collect as
little as possible, and all data received by us is treated with the
strictest of confidence with privacy always in mind, all data is held
securely.</p> Article 2.
Personal Identifiable Information &amp.
Data we collect <p>Although the information collected is basic and may not be classed as PII, we treat all data with the same respect and as such have listed all the data we collect from the services we provide.</p> Websites and other Web Services <p>Safing operates these websites, hosted and managed by GitHub (Pages):</p>
<ul>
<li>Website: https://safing.io</li>
<li>Documentation: https://docs.safing.io</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read GitHub’s privacy policy to see how they handle your data.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Safing additionally operates and manages the following websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account Service: https://account.safing.io</li>
<li>Account API Service: https://api.account.safing.io</li>
<li>Asset Server: https://assets.safing.io</li>
<li>Update Server: https://updates.safing.io</li>
<li>Support Server: https://support.safing.io</li>
</ul>
<p>The following personal identifiable information (PII) is held for technical reasons and is deleted after 72 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP Address</li>
<li>User Agent</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how the 72 hours are broken up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 24 hours until the raw logs are processed.</li>
<li>Another 24 hours for processing in technical and operational systems.</li>
<li>Another 24 hours for guaranteed full deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>While 72 hours is the maximum holding time period we guarantee, the time to deletion is usually a lot shorter.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Independently from this process, we always reduce PII as early as possible to reduce the time it is held and also reduce the number of systems the information is exposed to in the first place.
In some cases we even manage to delete IP addresses within an hour.</p> Your Account <p>If you register for and use an account on https://account.safing.io, we additionally collect this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>User name, supplied by you, not your real name.</li>
<li>Email address, required for some payment methods, our contact with you for account related information.</li>
<li>Country, and country calling code, required for Austrian taxation law.</li>
<li>Transaction identifiers necessary for processing, supplied to us by third party payment providers.</li>
<li>Password, always stored in an encrypted (hashed) form.</li>
</ul>
<p>This service also includes the domain https://api.account.safing.io, which hosts the API that the Portmaster interacts with.</p> The Portmaster Software <p>The Portmaster software runs locally on your device and monitors your network traffic in order to block unwanted connections.
While it handles a lot of PII internally, at no point does the Portmaster software share any PII with us or anyone else, with the exception of the following cases:</p>
<p>The Portmaster interacts with the following <strong>Web Services by Safing</strong>: https://updates.safing.io, https://support.safing.io, https://account.safing.io, https://api.account.safing.io<br>
Please refer to the previous sections to learn about these services.</p>
<p>If you choose to report an issue or give feedback via the <strong>support system</strong> within the Portmaster software, it sends your request with all its attached data to https://support.safing.io, which then forwards it to your chosen support channel.</p>
<p>If you use the <strong>Safing Privacy Network (SPN)</strong> module of the Portmaster, it supplies the username and password you enter to https://api.account.safing.io in order to log in.
These credentials are not provided to any server in the SPN, but an authorization token is used instead.
In the network itself, only the initial server knows and handles your IP address, which is never logged.</p>
<p>Please note that not all servers in the SPN are operated by Safing.
If the Portmaster makes use of <strong>servers that are operated by the community</strong> (ie.
a third party), we cannot guarantee how your information is handled by these operators.
While we need to make you aware of this policy-wise, there is no privacy risk associated with this, as the SPN is built to protect your privacy in exactly this case and every server only receives minimal and only parts of the connection data, so that no server can both identify you and identify what you do online.</p>
<p>As the Portmaster is also a <strong>DNS Client</strong>, it sends DNS queries to the configured DNS Providers.<br>
When you start using or configuring the Portmaster, please read the privacy policy of the configured DNS Providers.</p> Customer Support <p>Safing ICS Technologies GmbH run customer support services for its users, customer support covers all aspects of
the services provided, including and not limited to: accounts, Portmaster, SPN, general enquiries and questions
about our policies etc.

<li>
<strong>Email address</strong>, required for customer service replies etc.

<li>
<strong>Email content</strong>, held for the purposes of site and service enhancement.</li>
</ul> Forum <p>At present the forum is run on a third party service, however, with
respect to being open and transparent, our forum when running, is
usually on the Reddit platform, we have no control on how their service
collects, stores, shares, handles, or uses data, and as such, you are
advised to read any and all privacy policies of the sites you intend to
use.</p> Surveys <p>Safing ICS Technologies GmbH run surveys both continuous and in limited
time scope in order to best know and understand the needs of our
customers, these are used for development and enhancement of our
services, data supplied by users is kept until a user deletes it, these
surveys only collect basic information and not PII, by way of example
and not limited to, "Which Operating Systems do you use?".</p> Newsletter <p>Safing ICS Technologies GmbH periodically sends out a newsletter, when

California Online Privacy Protection Act, (CalOPPA) explained <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States of America to
require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
policy.</p>
<p>The law’s reach stretches well beyond California and requires a person
or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
operates websites/online services collecting personally identifiable
information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
policy on its website, that states exactly the information being
collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared.

data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.

against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
