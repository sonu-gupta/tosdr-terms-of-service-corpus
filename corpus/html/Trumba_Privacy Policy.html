</ul> Privacy Policy Last Revised: June 19, 2019 <p>Trumba Corporation (“<strong>Trumba</strong>”) provides and hosts for its clients (“Clients,” or “you) customizable web calendars including event promotion and registration tools.
When you use the calendar functionality, Trumba also makes available to you online calendar, scheduling, reminder, event information and publishing, and email and text messaging services.
Together, the calendar functionality and the additional functionalities offered on client calendars shall be referred to as the “Services,” which may be accessed directly from the Trumba website or through your web sites when you publish online calendars.</p>
