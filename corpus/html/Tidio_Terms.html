You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in San Francisco County, California, and any cause of action that relates to or arises from these Terms or the Services must be filed therein unless subject to the binding mediation and arbitration provisions set forth in the “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” section below applies to you.

<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

Special Arbitration Provision for United States and Canada Users
<p>
<strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS.
IF YOU ARE A TIDIO USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, TIDIO REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
THIS MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.
THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION.
FINALLY, THIS SECTION WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong>
</p>
<p>“Excluded Dispute” means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents).
For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Federal Arbitration Act.</strong>&nbsp;The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” section, including any question whether a Dispute between Tidio LLC and you is subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>
<strong>Agreement to Arbitrate for Tidio Users Located in the United States or Canada.</strong>&nbsp;For Tidio users located in the United States or Canada, Tidio and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes.
Tidio and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration.
Tidio and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the “AAA Rules”).
The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules.
The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at&nbsp;www.adr.org&nbsp;.
The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated.
The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, we will reimburse you for all the AAA administrative fees in Disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.</p>
<p>
<strong>Opt-Out Procedure.</strong>&nbsp;You may opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate.
If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt-out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms.
and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision.
You must use this address to opt-out:</p>
<p>Tidio LLC<br>160 Spear Street, #1000<br>San Francisco, California 94105<br>United States of America</p>
<p>You must include: (1) your name and residence address.
(2) the mobile phone number associated with your account.
and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt-out of our Terms’ agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p>
<strong>Small Claims Court.</strong>&nbsp;As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local “small claims” court’s rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local “small claims” court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.</p>
<p>
<strong>Time Limit to Start Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the Dispute first arose.
otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred.
This means that if we or you do not commence an arbitration within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.</p>
<p>
<strong>No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, or Representative Actions for Users Located in the United States or Canada.</strong>&nbsp;We and you each agree that if you are a Tidio user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people.
We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.</p>
<p>
<strong>Severability.</strong>&nbsp;If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption “Special Arbitration Provision for the United States or Canada Users” will be null and void as to that Dispute.</p>
<p>
<strong>Place to File Permitted Court Actions.</strong>&nbsp;If you opt-out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the “Forum and Venue” provisions in the “Dispute Resolution” section set forth above.</p>
<p>
<strong>UCITA.</strong> The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act or any version thereof, adopted by any state in any form (“UCITA”), shall not apply to these Terms and Conditions and, to the extent that UCITA is applicable, the user and Tidio hereby opt-out of the applicability of UCITA.</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal Notice for New Jersey Residents.</strong> Under the New Jersey Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice ACT (“TCCWNA”), N.J.S.A.
56:12-14 et seq., consumers may not be offered any written contract which includes any provision that violates any clearly established legal right of a consumer, or responsibility of a seller, as established by state or federal law.
In addition, under the TCCWNA, no consumer contract may state that any of its provisions are or may be void, unenforceable or inapplicable in some jurisdictions without specifying which provisions are or are not void, unenforceable or inapplicable in New Jersey.
Therefore, the following provisions of these Terms of Use shall not be applicable to New Jersey residents: (i)&nbsp;the provisions concerning limiting the Service’s liability for any loss or damage is not applicable to New Jersey residents to the extent the Service was negligent or has breached its obligation.
(ii) the provisions concerning the exclusion or limitation of certain damages is not applicable to New Jersey residents with respect to punitive damages, loss of data, and loss of or damage to property.
and (iii) the provisions concerning the indemnification by you is not applicable to New Jersey residents unless you were negligent or have breached these Terms of Use.</p>
