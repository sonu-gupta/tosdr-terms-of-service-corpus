Individual Arbitration, No Class Action Claims </dt>
<dd>
<p> All disputes or claims arising out of or relating in any way to your visit to the Site, your purchase, redemption or use of any of our Services, these Terms, this Agreement or the Privacy Policy shall be resolving by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except for matters that you may bring to small claims court.
You acknowledge that you are foregoing your right to a trial by jury, and will not proceed in a lawsuit in state or federal court.
Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to AAA commercial arbitration rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (where applicable), and be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
The arbitrator shall honor the terms of this Agreement, follow applicable law, and can issue reasonable relief, including monetary damages as well as injunctive, declaratory or statutory mandated relief.
</p>
<p> To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration, including a description of your claim, to our registered agent.
We will pay all filing, administration and arbitration fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines that the dispute was frivolous.
For larger claims, payment of those fees will be governed by the AAA’s fees schedule for Consumer Arbitration Costs.
Either of us may be able to recover attorney’s fees in arbitration as if the dispute were in court as available under applicable law.
The arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions unless the arbitrator determines that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary.
A decision by the arbitrator (including all findings of fact and conclusions of law) shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law.
A decision may also not be used in any litigation or arbitration involving any other person.
</p>
<p> Notwithstanding anything to this contrary in this section, each of us may bring a suit in court where otherwise stated, including to enjoin, infringement, unauthorized access or improper use of computer networks, customer data, misappropriation or theft of intellectual property, or other violation of your obligations under Section III.1 (Your use of the Site), Section III.2 (Content: Ownership), or Section III.3 (Copyright and Trademarks) of these Terms.
</p>
<p> All arbitration proceedings shall be individual arbitration.
You expressly agree that no other claims may be joined with your claims.
You further agree that you have voluntarily waived the right to file or join a lawsuit in state or federal court, a right to a jury trial, and the right to file or join a class action lawsuit, and expressly acknowledge that the parties reject class arbitration.
Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join, sue on behalf of a putative class or consolidated claims, or arbitrate any claim as a representative or in a class action.
</p>
<p> If any part of this Section of this Agreement, with the exception of the waiver of class action or class arbitration, is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court, that provision shall be severed and the balance of this Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the unenforceable provision were not included.
If the class action or class arbitration waiver is found to unenforceable, then the entire arbitration provision shall be null and void.
</p>
<p> The location of any dispute resolution, by arbitration or litigation, shall be in Chicago, Illinois.
Similarly, any action to enforcement an arbitration award must be brought in the state courts of the State of Illinois located in Chicago, Illinois.
You irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.
