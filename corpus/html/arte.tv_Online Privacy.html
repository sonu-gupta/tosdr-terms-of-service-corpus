<strong>Which regulations relating to the protection of personal data apply to ARTE?</strong>
<p>ARTE’s registered office is in France and it is therefore subject to French and European regulations relating to the protection of personal data, as well as decisions of the French Data Protection Commission CNIL which is the body to which you can make a complaint.</p>
<strong>Which personal data are processed by ARTE?</strong>
<p>ARTE may process two categories of data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Data that you provide to us.</strong>
<br>
We collect your personal data:<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>When you create a MyARTE account, in order to identify you and to enable you to use the functionalities provided by the MyARTE space (to list your favourite videos, to subscribe for programmes or to access your watched videos history);</li>
<li>When you take part in one-off events organised by ARTE, such as competitions;</li>
<li>When you register for our newsletter, so that we can send them to you regularly and improve the content;</li>
<li>When you post comments in the participatory spaces on our website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out more about the way the MyARTE space works, about the newsletter and about the participatory spaces, please consult our General Conditions of Use (CGU).</p>
<ul>
<li>When you give your opinion on our website, or you wish to send us a question using our feedback tool.
When you use our feedback tool, we may process the following data about you:
<ul>
<li>Metadata collected upon activation of the tool;</li>
<li>Your geolocation, on a city level;</li>
<li>Your e-mail address, if you wish to be contacted by ARTE (this field is optional);</li>
<li>Your name and forename, to enable us to give you a personalised answer (this field is optional);</li>
<li>The number of stars given to our site and your comments, if any.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These data are necessary for us to process your feedback, to improve our digital offer and to be able to give a personalised answer to your questions.</p>
<p>The data collected when you use the feedback tool are only kept for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes mentioned above.
In any event, they will not be kept for more than two (2) years.</p>
<p>The data collected are strictly for internal use and for our subcontractors: <em>Usabilla</em> (the publisher of the feedback tool) and <em>Comdata Group</em> (our telephone and viewer relations support company).
All the data that we process are stored within the European Union.
For reasons relating to the technical performance of the tool, the data may be transferred (and not stored) for a limited time to our subcontractor Usabilla’s infrastructures located outside the European Union, subject to an adequate level of security being put in place.</p>
<p>Your data will only be processed once ARTE has obtained your consent.
In order to take part in the survey, you must accept the cookie associated with our feedback tool and click on the button “send” accessible from the tool.</p>

<strong>Data collected automatically (by means of cookies):</strong> In order to continuously improve our site, we may use cookies, some of which require your consent.
These cookies enable us to collect information, particularly to analyse server traffic for statistical purposes and to track your usage so that we can optimise our sites, the quality of our content and our communications.
In addition, we process information such as your IP address in order to geolocate our content: this is essential for the management of broadcasting rights.
Finally, ARTE may use some of the information collected via cookies to identify those responsible for abuses, in cooperation with the authorities.
To find out more, consult the section: ARTE and cookies</li>
</ul>
<strong>For whom are these data intended?</strong>
<p>The information that we collect is intended for ARTE’s internal departments, which may use it in the context of their activities, and, if necessary, for our subcontractors.</p>
<p>ARTE uses subcontractors, that is to say, third-party service providers, which act on its behalf in specific areas: in particular, to measure audiences and for marketing purposes.<br>
These third-party companies only collect information when this is strictly necessary to carry out their mission on ARTE’s behalf.
They are not allowed to share such information or to use it for other purposes.</p>
<p>To find out more about the role of these third-party companies consult the section: Which categories of cookies and for what purposes?</p>
<strong>How long are these data kept?</strong>
<p>We only keep your personal data for the period necessary to achieve their purpose or to satisfy our legal or regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>To find out how long data associated with your MyARTE account is kept, refer to our General Conditions of Use (CGU).</p>
