If you directly engage with any of our partners, please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Services and directed by Yotpo is beyond the scope of Yotpo’s Terms and Privacy Policy, and may therefore be governed by the partner’s terms and privacy policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Customers and other Users</strong>: <strong>Customer Data</strong> is typically shared and is available to the Users belonging to such customer’s account.
<strong>Yotpo User Data</strong> is shared with the administrator of the customer’s account to which such User belongs (including data and communications concerning such user’s account).
In such cases, sharing such data means that the administrator(s) or other users of the same account may access it on behalf of the customer, and will be able to monitor, process and analyze the personal data contained therein.
This includes instances where you may contact us for help in resolving an issue specific to a team of which you are a member (and which is managed by the same customer).</p>

<p>Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), you may also clear the opt-out cookies installed once you opt-out, so an additional opt-out will be necessary to prevent additional tracking.</p>7.
Communications<p>We engage in service and promotional communications, through e-mail, phone, SMS and notifications.</p>
<p>
<strong>Service Communications</strong>: We may contact you with information regarding our Services.
For example, we may send you notifications (through any of the means available to us) of changes or updates to our Services, billing issues, log-in attempts or password reset notices, etc.

Data Security<p>We and our hosting services implement systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal data, to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information.
These measures provide sound industry standard security.
However, although we make efforts to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that our Services will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.</p>9.
Data Subject Rights<p>Individuals have rights concerning their personal data.
If you wish to exercise your privacy rights under applicable law, including the GDPR, UK GPDR or the CCPA, such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of your personal data held with Yotpo, or to restrict or object to such data’s processing, or to port such personal data, or the right to equal services and prices (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you) – please contact us by e-mail at: privacy@yotpo.com</p>
<p>Please note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal data related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access.
Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g.
as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 4 above.</p>
<p>We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.</p>
<p>
<strong>If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding personal data that we process on our customer’s behalf, please contact the customer or the administrator of such customer’s account directly</strong>, as they would be the “data controller” of such data (see Section 10 below).
Note that if you do contact us in this regard, we may share your communications with the relevant customer and its account users.
and that we may also share the contact details of the account administrator with individuals who sent us such a request or query relating to this account.</p>10.
Data Controller/Processor<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the “<strong>data controller</strong>” (or under the CCPA, “<strong>business</strong>”), who determines the purposes and means of processing.
and the “<strong>data processor</strong>” (or under the CCPA, “<strong>service provider</strong>”), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business).
Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.</p>
<p>
<strong>Yotpo is the “data controller” of Yotpo Website, CRM &amp.
Prospect Data</strong>.
With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of “data processor”.</p>
<p>
<strong>Yotpo is the “data processor” of Customer Data</strong>, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the “data controller” of such data.
and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the “<strong>sub-processors</strong>” of such data.</p>
<p>
<strong>Yotpo is both a “data controller” and “data processor” of Yotpo User Data</strong>.
Such data is processed by Yotpo for its own purposes (as described in Section 2 above), as an independent ‘controller’.
whilst those certain portions of it which are included in <strong>Customer Data</strong> will be processed by us on our customer’s behalf, as a ‘processor’.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Yotpo processes <strong>Customer Data</strong> strictly in accordance with such customer’s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.
The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for establishing a legal basis for proceeding and providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data – including sufficient reference to the processing of their personal data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws.
and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.</p>11.
