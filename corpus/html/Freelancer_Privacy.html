</p> Exercising your other rights <p>
You have a number of other rights in relation to the personal data Freelancer holds about you, however, there may be restrictions on how you may exercise the rights.

You have the right to: </p>
<ul>
<li>seek human review of automated decision-making or profiling</li>
<li>opt-out of direct marketing, and profiling for marketing</li>
<li>erasure</li>
<li>temporary restriction of processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Human review of automated decision making / profiling</b> - In the case of our ranking algorithms, it is not possible to exercise this right as this ranking is a fundamental part of the marketplace that users participate in, opting out would mean not being able to participate in the marketplace.
Decisions affecting marketplace security are already reviewed by humans.
</p>
<p>
<b>Direct marketing and profiling</b> - users can control what emails they receive through their settings page.
</p>
<p>
<b>Erasure</b> - Most personal information and user generated content cannot be deleted as they are used to support contracts between users, document financial transactions, and are used in providing protecting other legitimate users of the marketplace.
In the case of non-personal data that can be linked with personal data, it will either be erased or otherwise anonymised from the personal data.</p>
<p>
<b>Temporary restriction to processing</b> - under certain circumstances you may exercise this right, in particular if you believe that the personal data we have is not accurate, or you believe that we do not have legitimate grounds for processing your information.
In either case you may exercise this right by contacting our privacy officer.
</p>
<p>
Unless stated above, users may exercise any of the above rights by contacting our Privacy Officer.
