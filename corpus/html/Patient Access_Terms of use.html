<strong> The Service</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.1 The Service enables you to register a Patient Access account without linking to your GP practice, providing (but not limited to) the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book appointments for a variety of healthcare services that may be made available by our partner services independently of your GP practice.</li>
<li>A ‘Get health advice’ service that helps you search for symptoms and find articles to support your healthcare.</li>
<li>A ‘Medication Assistant’ service that allows you to receive information and notifications to help you better manage your medication.</li>
<li>Find NHS Self-Referral services by area.</li>
<li>Read the latest health articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.2 Additionally the Service enables you to register and link to your GP practice.
If your GP practice supports Patient Access you will have access to the following features where they are able to provide them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book face-to-face, video or remote appointments with your GP or other healthcare practitioners at your GP practice.</li>
<li>Request repeat prescriptions via a nominated pharmacy.</li>
<li>Send messages to your GP practice.</li>
<li>Act as a proxy on behalf of your relative or dependent.</li>
<li>A ‘Contact your GP and get health advice’ service that helps you search for symptoms and submit them to your GP.</li>
<li>Remotely access details in respect of your medical records which are held by your GP Practice.
Access is dependent upon a number of factors, including that: (i) the relevant GP Practice use a compatible clinical system.
(ii) the relevant GP Practice has activated the functionality within its clinical systems so that the Service is accessible to you for use and (iii) you successfully complete the registration process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, where you have signed up for the Medication&nbsp;Assistant service we will be able to provide information and notification related to existing medications that we know of from your electronic health record.</p>
<p>3.3 In addition to the services detailed in section 3.2, for accounts linked to your GP practice you also have the option to activate the Smart Pharmacy service.
The Smart Pharmacy service allows you to nominate one of any of ‘Smart Pharmacies’ (being pharmacies that are set up to deliver this additional functionality) in your vicinity via Patient Access.
If no pharmacies have registered as ‘Smart Pharmacies’ in your area then this feature will not be available unless or until this happens.
Once you have nominated a Smart Pharmacy we will copy your NHS number into your account (to act as a unique identifier) and share it with your nominated pharmacy.
We will then be able to provide you with notifications regarding your prescriptions (as may be provided to us by the relevant pharmacy), including details as to when it is ready for collection (or is out for delivery as appropriate).</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the messages we send contain information provided by your nominated Smart Pharmacy (or your GP practice as appropriate).
We are not able to validate whether or not this information correct (for example, if in fact your prescription is ready for collection) and it is provided on an ‘as is’ basis.
You should address any issues with regard to the accuracy of such messages to your nominated pharmacy.</p>
<p>Details of the various elements comprising the Patient Access Service are set out at the Website (as may be updated from time to time).
Please ensure that you familiarise yourself with this information.</p>
<p>3.4 Your GP Practice is able to activate or deactivate (all or certain elements of) the Services set out in section 3.2 and 3.3 at its discretion in relation to some or all of its registered patients.
If for whatever reason your GP Practice should choose to limit certain elements of the Service within its clinical systems then this will impact on your ability to use the Service and if this should occur then it is something you should discuss this with your GP Practice directly.</p>
<p>3.5 The Service is designed to be accessed via the Website or through our App.</p>
<p>3.6 After you have accessed your medical record you may be given the option of exporting or printing elements of your record.
We recommend that you should only print or export any data where there is a clear need for you to do so.
If you do choose to print or export any data then it is out of our (or your GP Practice’s) control and you are responsible for ensuring that any medical record data you export or print is held securely.
We will not be liable for any disclosure of sensitive and personal data if such disclosure arises as a result of you using the Service to export or print out or otherwise share any information made available to you via the App or Website.</p>

<strong> Termination</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>11.1 You are free to stop using the Service at any time.
If you breach any of these Terms of Use we can stop providing all or part of the Service to you.
If we terminate (or suspend) your access to the Service then we will notify you by email or at the next time you attempt to access your account.
Where you have linked your account to your GP practice, our ability to provide those GP practice enabled Services to you is dependent upon your GP Practice continuing to keep active the relevant functionality within their clinical system.

In all such cases, the contract between us under these Terms of Use shall terminate and:</p>
<p>11.1.1 all rights granted to you shall cease;</p>

<li>
<strong> Collection of Personal Data</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>12.1 If you register to use the Service then EMIS may collect personal data about you (which may include name, date of birth, NHS number, e-mail address and phone number, the Device's phone number, username, password and other registration information (and if registering for the Service online, your sex, house number and postcode).
This data will be securely held in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Policy (please see&nbsp;https://support.patientaccess.com/privacy-policy).</p>
<p>12.2 Please note that your medical record at all times remains within the control of your GP Practice.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong> Share your record Service</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>13.1 The ‘share your record’ service (which is an element of the Service provided at the discretion of your GP when you have linked to your GP practice) enables users to share elements of their medical record with third parties through functionality within the Patient Access service.</p>
<p>13.2 If you choose to use the share your record service then by selecting the relevant options you will be able to generate a secure link and a QR Code (which can be scanned by an appropriate reader) which you can share with a third party, who can then use that information (together with a passcode which you must also share with them) to access a read only copy of your medical record (or those sections of your medical record which you have chosen to share).
For security reasons this link will be valid for a period of 24 hours from the time it is created, after which it will no longer work and you would need to create a new link should you wish to do so.
You are also able to deactivate any valid link within the 24 hour sharing period at any time via the same section of the Service which you used to create the link.</p>
<p>13.3 You are responsible for choosing to share your medical record and you must do so with all due care.
Please note that while you can revoke access via the share your record service at any time, while the link is live there is nothing to prevent any third party with whom you have shared the link from itself making that link available to other persons, and if they have the passcode from copying the data contained in the record or taking screenshots of the information.
Given the nature of the information in your record it is your responsibility to only provide the link to trusted recipients that may need access to certain details so as to be better able to provide you with care (for example, if you were abroad then you may wish to give access to a local pharmacist to enable them to check whether you have certain allergies recorded in your record).
By sharing your record, you acknowledge that this is done at your own risk.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong> Choice of Law and Jurisdiction</strong>
