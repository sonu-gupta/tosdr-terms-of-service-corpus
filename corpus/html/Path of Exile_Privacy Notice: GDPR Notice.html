<strong>Processing personal data:</strong> The personal data Grinding Gear Games may process consists of the personal information described in its Privacy Notice.
This personal data may be processed for the purposes outlined in that privacy notice.
The legal basis for Grinding Gear Games’ processing of personal data depends on the type of personal data and the specific context in which it collects it.
However, Grinding Gear Games normally processes personal data only where (a) it has your consent to do so, (b) where it needs to process personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g.
to provide the Website, Materials or Services to you), or (c) where the processing is necessary for the purposes of Grinding Gear Games’ legitimate interests (except where such interests would be overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data).</p>

<p>In addition to the above, Grinding Gear Games may process any of your personal data where such processing is necessary for compliance with applicable laws or regulations.</p>
<p>You do not have to provide Grinding Gear Games with some information that is automatically collected when you use any of the Website, Materials and Services, e.g.

However, you must provide us with (a) your email address and username or (b) a username and Steam Account ID when using the Materials and Services.
The consequence of not providing one or the other of these is that Grinding Gear Games will not be able to set you up a Member Account in order to log into the Website or PoE.</p>
