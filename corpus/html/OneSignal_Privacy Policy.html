<p>Your privacy is important to us and maintaining your trust is one of our highest priorities.
This Privacy Policy includes a description of our information practices, how we use tracking technologies, as well as the decision you may make regarding how your information is collected and used.<br>
</p>
<strong>Introduction and Background </strong>
<p>OneSignal, a U.S.
company located at 2850 S Delaware St Suite 201, San Mateo, CA 94403 (“OneSignal” “we,” “us,” and “our”), provides this privacy policy because we believe that customers should have clear and comprehensive ways to understand how information about them and their end-users is collected and used to provide our service.
</p>
<p>OneSignal is a customer engagement platform for companies around the world to enable relationships for them and their customers.
This is primarily done by leveraging first party data to personalize and automate messaging through first party channels, such as email, mobile push notifications, web push notifications, and in-app messaging.
</p>
<p>OneSignal collects this first party data through a software development kit (“SDKs”) that companies use in their mobile applications and websites.
These web and mobile SDKs permit app developers and websites to send, manage, optimize and customize messages to their users.
All of these services (further described in this privacy policy) are referred to collectively as our “<strong>Services </strong>,” and all of these developers, website operators, partners and advertisers are referred to collectively as our “<strong>Clients </strong>.” </p>
<p>This privacy policy (the “<strong>Privacy Policy </strong>”) explains how we may collect, use, store, and disclose information about the end users (“<strong>End Users </strong>”) of third-party mobile applications and websites that use our Services.
We also collect information on our corporate website(s), including any website on which this Privacy Policy is posted.
We separately describe how we collect, use and share that website information (“<strong>OneSignal Website Information”) </strong>in Section 4, below.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
Our SDKs: Information We Collect and Services We Provide </strong>
</p>
<p>We refer to the information we collect from our SDKs as the ‘<strong>SDK Information </strong>.” The SDK Information includes (or may include) the following: </p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Information Collected About End Users by Our Web SDKs </strong>
</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Web pages visited that have implemented the SDK, and information about those visits (e.g., session duration, time-stamp, referring URLs)</li>
<li>What push notifications an End User has been sent</li>
<li>Information about End User’s transactions and interactions with apps and websites</li>
<li>IP address, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information</li>
<li>Email address, if provided to us.</li>
<li>Information about an End User’s browser, such as browser language type and version of operating system (e.g., Android, iOS).
network provider.
language setting.
time zone </li>
<li>A unique cookie identifier, which may uniquely identify an End User (such as in de-identified or anonymous form).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Information Collected About End Users by Our Mobile SDKs </strong>
</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>How a user has used the App (e.g., session duration, time-stamp) </li>
<li>Purchases made within an app.
</li>
<li>Information about End User’s transactions and interactions with the app</li>
<li>Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs (“Mobile IDs”).
These Mobile IDs may be associated with other Information, including with Data Segments.</li>
<li>Precise Location information, generally an End User’s lat/long data (i.e., GPS-level data) or WiFi information, which we may associate with Mobile IDs, and which may be collected whether or not an app is in use.
(Location information is only collected the user has granted permission to the App to collect this, and the app chooses to send this data to OneSignal)</li>
<li>Email address, if provided to us.</li>
<li>IP address as well as system configuration information</li>
<li>Information associated with or related to devices, such as device type (e.g., mobile, tablet).
type and version of operating system (e.g., Android, iOS).
network provider.
mobile browser (e.g.
Safari, Chrome, etc.).
language setting.
time zone.
and network status type (such as WiFi).
</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted above, we refer to all of the above collectively as the “<strong>SDK Information </strong>.” </p>
<p>
<strong>2.
How We Use the SDK Information </strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>We use the SDK Information to provide a variety of Services to our Clients.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To Provide Our App and Website Services.
We use the SDK Information to offer and support app and website features provided through the SDKs, including those related to push notifications.
This includes, for instance, providing customer, technical and operational support for these features, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity.
resolving disputes and enforcing our EULA and other rights we may have.
It also includes analyzing, customizing, and improving the features we offer Clients.</li>
<li>To provide information and analytics to our Clients about the use of these app and website features provided through the SDKs, or to help app developers and website operators create or enhance user profiles.</li>
<li>To enable clients to create inferences about End Users categorized into “Data Segments”.
For instance, if SDK Information indicates that a particular device is frequently seen at restaurants, we might categorize a user for targeting of local restaurant offers.
Or, if a user is frequently seen at sports stadiums, we might categorize the user as a “Sports Fan.”</li>
<li>To develop and use “predictive models” – data models that try to predict End Users’ potential future behavior and interests on a per-device basis or across devices.</li>
<li>To analyze ad performance, for instance, by attributing End Users’ app installations, web visits, or store visits to ad campaigns.</li>
<li>Sometimes, the SDK Information may be used to resolve identities across multiple devices, such as to match IP addresses or hashed emails to link an End User across (for instance) browsers, mobile devices, tablets, set top boxes, or other devices.</li>
<li>Sometimes the SDK Information may be to perform any of the above functions, or other marketing or analytics services.
Or, we may aggregate and create data “models” to do this – creating algorithms in order to predict certain trends and things that different End Users might have in common, for instance.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may deploy online cookies to track users across websites, or to associate users (and these cookies) with Mobile IDs.
We may do this to resolve user identifies across platforms, and to better or more accurately target messages to.
You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in the Section titled “<strong>Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs </strong>.”<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
How and Why We Share the SDK Information.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>To Provide Services to Websites and Apps Using the SDKs</em>
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We share the SDK Information with service providers, contractors and other companies to fulfill your orders, operate our business, communicate with you and make available our Services and this Website.
These service providers may help us perform any of the activities set forth in Section 2.
For instance, we may share certain of the information we collect or receive with companies that help us with billing and payment, marketing, advertising and email marketing, data enhancement (e.g., to provide more relevant offers), website hosting, technology and customer support, web and marketing analytics, anti-fraud or security operations, and other operational, marketing or business support.
</li>
<li>We likewise may share the SDK Information or Data Segments we create with website operators and app developers (for instance, related to push notifications they send) for their advertising, analytics, or other purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>

<li>If the disclosure is done as part of, including as part of due diligence for, a purchase, transfer, or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, any information we have may be one of the transferred assets) or in the event of bankruptcy</li>
</ul>
<p>Even when you no longer access the SDKs, we may continue to use and share your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>

This information may include personal information, such as your name, email address, and other contact information.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Passively Collected (e.g., Cookies and Unique IDs): </strong> We use automated mechanisms, such as cookies, pixels, and other locally stored objects (such as “IndexedDB)”) that we associate with unique identifiers in order to keep track of visitor interactions with the OneSignal Websites.
(You can learn more about these technologies below in the Section titled “<strong>Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs </strong>”).
We may use third party-services such as Google Analytics, in which case those third parties gather information such as your IP address, browser type, the webpage from which you came to our website, and the times of your access to the OneSignal Website.
In addition, as you browse our website, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in.
Our display advertising partners may then help us retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the OneSignal Website.
To “opt out” of having your information used to tailor ads to you in this way by third party ad platforms that we may work with or provide data to, please review the Section below titled “<strong>Consumer Control and Opt Out Options </strong>
<strong>” </strong> to learn how to opt-out of these services and instead receive generic, non-tailored ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>How We Use the OneSignal Website Information </strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to the uses described above, we use the OneSignal Website Information (alone or in combination) to provide, market, and operate the OneSignal Websites and Services.
Among other things, by collecting the OneSignal Website Information, we are able to</p>
<ul>

<p>
<strong>5.
Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies and Pixel Tags.
</strong>Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier.
Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your device or browser.
Our servers may send your device a cookie when you visit the OneSignal Websites, and our Clients and Partners may do likewise on our Websites, our Clients’ websites, and elsewhere.
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.
When you access web pages on which a pixel tag is deployed, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit OneSignal, our Clients or Partners to set or read cookies.
Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to anonymously track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device.
If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit.
OneSignal, alone or with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you (e.g., when you visit the OneSignal Websites or the websites of our Clients or Partners), track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or interact with advertising.
We and partners we work with use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests.
We may sometimes use other locally stored objects in ways similar to how we use cookies.
Often, these objects are deleted when you clear your browser cookie cache, but because this may not always occur (depending on the browser you use), we recommend that if you wish to opt out of notification features or third party interest-based advertising you instead follow the steps we have set forth in Section 7 titled “<strong>Consumer Control &amp.
Opt-Out Options.
</strong>”</p>
<p>
<strong>Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.
</strong> We may use or work with partners who use mobile SDKs (including our own SDKs, which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Services and those using our Services.
The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.
We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.
</p>
<p>
