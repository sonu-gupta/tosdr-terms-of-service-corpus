Terms of Service
Last revised: October 21, 2021
<p>This website (the “website”) and LitCharts mobile applications (the "apps") are operated by LitCharts LLC (“LitCharts”).
All of the Terms of Service explained herein that refer to the website or "Service" apply equally to the use of our mobile apps.</p>
<p>The Terms of Service set forth below are binding on all users of this website and of LitCharts mobile apps.
By directing your browser to this website or otherwise accessing the pages of this website or any LitCharts apps, you accept these Terms of Service.
LitCharts may change the Terms of Service, or may modify or discontinue the website or services offered thereon, at any time at its sole discretion.
LitCharts reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to deny further or continuing access to the website or Service to any visitor, including, without limitation, any user that LitCharts determines has violated any aspect of these Terms of Service.
LitCharts reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to seek and obtain any other remedies available to it pursuant to any applicable laws and regulations as a result of your breach of these Terms of Service or any other act or omission by you that gives rise to a claim by LitCharts.</p>
<p>
<strong>PLEASE BE ADVISED: These terms contain provisions that govern how claims that you and LitCharts have against each other can be brought.
These provisions will, with limited exception, require that you submit claims you have against LitCharts to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or proceeding.</strong>
</p>
Users Under Age 16
<p>We do not permit anyone under age 16 to register for a free user account or a "LitCharts A+" paid membership subscription account.
We do not collect any data or other personally identifiable information from anyone under age 16.
Parents and legal guardians using the website and/or purchasing a subscription on behalf of a child are enitrely responsible for their child’s use of the website, including all fees and legal liability that they incur.</p>
Free Registered User Accounts
<p>LitCharts users can create free registered user accounts to access certain features available to logged in free registered users.
LitCharts free registered user accounts are distinct from paid "LitCharts A+" membership subscription accounts, which give users access to paid premium subscribers-only content.</p>
A+ Membership Subscription and Other Paid Features
<p>Access to much of LitCharts is free, but if you would like to upgrade to a paid LitCharts A+ membership subscription or any other paid features (the "Service"), the following terms apply.</p>
Billing and Payment
<p>LitCharts bills you through an online account for use of the Service.
You agree to pay LitCharts all charges associated with your paid subscription using this online account.
You agree to maintain current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account at any time you have a subscription.
In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for you credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer.
LitCharts may change the membership subscription price from time to time, such as by offering coupons for promotional purposes, at its sole discretion, but will notify you by email in the event of a price increase before your subscription renews.</p>
Automatic Renewal
<p>(1) Your subscription for the Service will continue indefinitely until you cancel it via your Account Settings page.
After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period.
You agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature.
In the event of a price increase, we will notify you before your subscription automatically renews.
If you do not wish for your account to renew automatically you can cancel your account at any time.
For step-by-step guidelines on how to cancel, please see our Help Center.</p>
<p>(2) By subscribing, you authorize LitCharts to charge your credit card, debit card or other payment method when your subscription begins.
Your payment method will be charged automatically again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period, including any sales or similar taxes imposed on your subscription payments.
Upon the renewal of your subscription, if LitCharts does not receive payment, you agree that LitCharts may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your payment method provider until payment is received or you cancel your subscription.
Upon receipt of payment, your account will be reactivated and will continue to be charged automatically for each renewal period until you cancel.</p>
Cancellation Policy
<p>
<em>Cancellation by You.</em> You can cancel your LitCharts A+ subscription at any time at least 24 hours before the next subscription renewal date by going to the “Subscription” tab in your Account Settings, as outlined in our Help Center.
If you cancel your subscription, we will not bill you again at the end of your current subscription period.
You will have continued access to LitCharts A+ until the end of your then-current subscription term and your subscription will not renew thereafter.</p>
<p>As stated in the Refund Policy below, LitCharts A+ subscription fees are generally not refundable.
This means LitCharts will not issue a refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for your then-current subscription period.</p>
<p>
<em>Termination by LitCharts.</em> LitCharts is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your LitCharts A+ subscription or your account, for any reason, in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms of Service.
LitCharts has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of these Terms.
If you violate our Terms of Service and we terminate your account, you will no longer have access to your account and you will not be eligible for a refund under any circumstances.</p>
Refund Policy
<p>LitCharts A+ subscription fees are generally not refundable.
We may choose to offer a refund, on a case-by-case basis, and at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>LitCharts explicitly does not offer refunds in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a user discovers that LitCharts does not cover the material they need or expected to find on our service.
Since much of our content is available to preview for free, users must make this judgement for themselves before subscribing.
If you are unsure whether or not our subscribers-only content will meet your needs, please download a free sample prior to subscribing.</li>
<li>If a user has logged in, even if only once, after subscribing to LitCharts A+.
As a subscriber, you have access to all of our premium subscribers-only content immediately.
Much like a Netflix or Spotify subscription, a LitCharts A+ subscription covers access to our content, regardless of how often or whether you use it.</li>
<li>If a user forgets to cancel prior to renewal.
Subscribers have complete control over initiating, cancelling, and reactivating subscriptions.
This means that as a subscriber, you can easily:</li>
<ul>
<li>Cancel your subscription at any time at least 24 hours before the next subscription renewal date.
Here’s how to cancel your subscription.</li>
<li>Resubscribe at any time in the future.
Here’s how to reactivate your subscription.</li>
</ul>
<li>If a user subscribes under any false or fraudulent pretenses.
LitCharts user accounts are licensed to one user per account.
Failure to comply with this, or any other clause in our Terms of Service, precludes the user from the possibility of a refund.</li>
<li>If a user has deleted his or her account.
We are unable to offer refunds, under any circumstances, for any accounts which have been deleted.
Subscribers acknowledge that they are ineligible for refunds for any unused portion of their subscription upon deleting their account.</li>
</ul>
Fraud
<p>If you believe your financial information has been used fraudulently, please contact support@litcharts.com for assistance.</p>
Disputes and Chargebacks
<p>If you file a dispute for a LitCharts transaction with your financial institution, your account will be immediately closed and you will be banned from subscribing again.
If you have a concern about billing, you are encouraged to reach out to support@litcharts.com prior to filing a dispute.
Once a dispute has been filed with your financial institution, we are unable to assist with any billing questions or offer you a courtesy refund.
Your account will immediately be terminated and banned and this action is irreversible.
No refunds will be provided for accounts that have filed a chargeback or dispute.</p>
Privacy
<p>All information submitted on the website might potentially be publicly accessible.
We are not responsible for protecting, nor are we liable for failing to protect, the privacy of electronic mail or other information transferred through the Internet or any other network that you may utilize.
Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information regarding privacy.
The privacy policy is incorporated into and is a part of these Terms of Service.</p>

However, LitCharts cannot and does not guarantee that any personally identifiable information provided to us will not become public under any circumstances.</p>

Violation of this restriction may result in infringement of intellectual property and contractual rights of LitCharts or third parties, which is prohibited by law and could result in substantial civil and criminal penalties.</p>
Sharing Digital Copies Privately by Teachers and Educators is Temporarily Permitted (March 31, 2020 - December 31, 2021)
<p>Exclusively for the purpose of distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, sharing digital versions of the Content protected by copyright (such as our printable literature and poetry guides, Shakespeare translations, and Teacher Editions), or other proprietary right, is permitted.
Permission to share digital copies is limited to school teachers sharing directly with students only (as they would otherwise do in person in class), such as by sharing a folder or file on Google Drive or Google Classroom.
However, distributing digital copies more widely, such as posting any of our content publicly on the web, including it as part of another online or offline educational service or resource, or posting it on a private schoolwide LMS where any student at the school can access it, is not permitted.
This limited permission granted to teachers and educators will expire December 31, 2021.</p>
Sharing Printed Copies is Permitted
<p>You may distribute print copies of our downloadable content, such as our literature guide PDFs and the files contained in our Teacher Edition zip files, for any educational non-commercial use.

Any copies made by you must retain without modification any and all copyright notices and other proprietary marks.</p>

We reserve the right at our sole discretion to refuse service, cancel subscriptions, terminate accounts, and ban users who violate this clause.
No refunds will be issued in the event of a ban, termination, or account closure for this reason.</p>

<p>Account login information may not be shared or transferred to anyone other than the original subscriber or account holder.
You may only create one account with us.
If your account has been suspended or terminated, you may not create another account.
You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.
Any activity that purposefully or negligently jeopardizes the security of your LitCharts account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log on as you on the Services) is subject to immediate termination without refund.</p>

<p>In certain instances, LitCharts may agree to provide you with access to secure, password protected pages of the website.
Such access is restricted to authorized users only.

Arbitration and Governing Law

The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against LitCharts in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against LitCharts any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</p>

Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.
You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>
<p>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service, and any dispute between you and LitCharts, shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
