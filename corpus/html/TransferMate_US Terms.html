</ul>
<strong>6.
Concluding a Payment Transaction</strong>
<ul>
<li>6.1.
Your Order constitutes an invitation from You for Us to negotiate a Payment Transaction with You.
Our response to Your Order (by the means set out at Clause 6.2) represents a legal offer from Us for You to enter a Payment Transaction subject to certain conditions set out in the offer.
This offer must be accepted by You, following which the Contract is formed subject to these Terms and Conditions.
Confirmation of the Contract shall be emailed to You (the "<strong>Booking Confirmation</strong>") by Us after the Contract has been formed.</li>
<li>6.2.
This Contract can be concluded by following the means of placing an Order set out at Clause 5.2, though We reserve Our right to engage with You by whatever means We deem most appropriate in concluding the Contract.
In each instance, Your acceptance, by whatever means, serves as Your acceptance these Terms and Conditions as governing the offer made by Transfermate to enter the Contract for a Payment Transaction.</li>
<li>6.3.
Non-negotiation of Orders: <ul>
<li>6.3.1.
We reserve the right to request further documents and information before entering negotiations with You in respect of an Order;</li>
<li>6.3.2.
Payment Transactions are subject to a minimum and maximum transaction value determined by Us, and We may decline to negotiate an Order which falls outside of these value points, notwithstanding that prior Orders of equivalent value were not declined.
and</li>
<li>6.3.3.
We may notify You of Our refusal to negotiate an Order without giving any reason.
We will have no liability to You as a result of doing so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6.4.
Cancellation of Payment Transactions: <ul>
<li>6.4.1.
In the event of Your having formed a Contract with Us in error, You are advised to contact Us immediately on receipt of the Booking Confirmation requesting the Contract to be cancelled.
Any loss arising on such cancellation will be charged to You and payable by You, and there may be additional cancellation fees attaching to Your request as set out in the Standard Fee Schedule or otherwise negotiated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6.5.
Non-execution or Delays in Payment Transactions: <ul>
<li>6.5.1.
Notwithstanding the formation of a Contract, We hereby reserve a contractual right to delay or not to complete the execution of the Payment Transaction in instances where: <ul>
<li>6.5.1.1.
abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances beyond Our control or prohibit or limit Us executing the Payment Transaction;</li>
<li>6.5.1.2.
legal obligations covered by applicable laws and regulations make the execution of the Payment Transaction a potentially illegal or non-compliant action;</li>
<li>6.5.1.3.
Our Anti-Money Laundering Policy requires so, or where any requirement under our Anti-Money Laundering Policy cannot be met to Our satisfaction;</li>
<li>6.5.1.4.
due to the automation of the Transaction Service, errors in quoted rates may have occurred leading to the provision to You of erroneous rates at the time of placing the Order.
or</li>
<li>6.5.1.5.
errors, inaccuracies or omissions in Your Order may mean that a Payment Transaction cannot be completed (meaning Our making the Final Transfer) as scheduled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6.5.2.
We shall endeavor to inform You as soon as possible in the event of non-execution of the Payment Transaction as set out in Clause 6.5.1 and in any event no later than the next Business Day, together with the reason for the failure unless We are prevented (in our sole discretion) from disclosing same to You.
We shall endeavor to complete the Payment Transaction if the impediment preventing execution can be removed, or where applicable, when the errors, inaccuracies or omissions are corrected.</li>
<li>6.5.3.
Where the provisions of Clause 6.5.1 lead to the non-completion of or a delay in execution of a Payment Transaction, any commitments provided by Us as to the timing of making the Final Transfer may be adversely impacted, and therefore We accept no liability for the non-completion of, or a delay to completing, a Payment Transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6.6.
Effecting the Lodgment: <ul>
<li>6.6.1.
Under these Terms and Conditions which govern the Contract, You are legally obliged to complete the Lodgment of the agreed amount with the Booking Reference within 2 Business Days of the date on which the Contract is entered (the "<strong>Settlement Date</strong>").
Accordingly, this Contract is suitable only if You are able to deliver, on or before the Settlement Date, the Lodgment in the currency/funds You have agreed to buy from Us.</li>
<li>6.6.2.
Delivery of the Lodgment shall be by use of <u>one of the two methods set out at Clause 7</u>.
Under no circumstances shall We accept a Lodgment by any other means, even if We have previously permitted such alternative means of making a Lodgment.</li>
<li>6.6.3.
A failure by You to make the Lodgment in full and by the Settlement Date is a breach of the Contract, in which event We will close out the Contact at its then prevailing market rates and any loss or costs incurred by Us as a result of Your contractual breach shall be recoverable in full from You on demand by Us, including additional cancellation fees attaching to Your request as set out in the Standard Fee Schedule or otherwise negotiated.
Late or incomplete settlement shall incur default interest on the total amount due, at a compound rate of 5% per annum, calculated daily and payable to Us on the date payment is made.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6.7.
Processing the Final Transfer: <ul>
<li>6.7.1.
The time at which We receive the Lodgment in cleared funds in the Nominated Account determines the time at which We can process the Payment Transaction.

<li>6.7.2.
The amount credited by way of Final Transfer to the Beneficiary will be net of fees, charges, commissions and any interest due.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6.8.
A confirmation of the Final Transfer (the "<strong>Payment Confirmation</strong>") will be issued to Your nominated email address.
If You do not receive a Payment Confirmation within 24 hours of the date on which the Lodgment is made or within 4 Business Days from the date of the Contract was entered, You are obliged to contact Us.
The Payment Confirmation will detail (where applicable): <ul>
<li>6.8.1.
the Booking Reference, which enables You to identify the Payment Transaction, which shall also be provided to the Beneficiary unless You expressly request Us not to make such disclosure.
By hereby permitting such disclosure, You agree to hold Us harmless for any damage or loss suffered by You resulting from enquiries from the Beneficiary or any holder of the Booking Reference.
We represent and warrant that We will exercise ordinary care in releasing this information.</li>
<li>6.8.2.
the date on which the Payment Transaction was effected;</li>
<li>6.8.3.

<li>6.8.4.

<li>6.10.
You irrevocably agree that We may retain any Lodgments transmitted to Us pursuant to these Terms and Conditions if We learn that there is a suspicion that You may have breached any laws or regulations, or if We are required to do so by any legal or regulatory authorities.
Such retained Lodgments shall not bear interest against Us.</li>
<li>6.11.If you are located within the State of Washington, You are entitled to a refund of all moneys received for transmittal within ten (10) days of receipt of a written request for a refund unless:</li>
<ul>
<li>6.11.1.
instructions have been given committing an equivalent amount of money to the person designated by you prior to receipt of a written request for a refund;</li>
<li>6.11.2.
We have reasons to believe that a crime has occurred, is occurring, or may potentially occur as a result of transmitting the money as requested by the customer or refunding the money as requested by the customer.
or</li>
<li>6.11.3.
We are otherwise barred by law from making a refund.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<strong>7.
Funding the Transfermate Nominated Account </strong>
<ul>
<li>7.1.
By Wire Transfer or Electronic Funds Transfer: <ul>
<li>7.1.1.
The default mechanism by which You are expected to make the Lodgment is by payment of a wire transfer or electronic funds transfer in the currency agreed.</li>
<li>7.1.2.
We will provide You with the requisite details of the Transfermate Nominated Account at the time at which the Contract is agreed, and it is Your obligation to ensure You use the correct Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7.2.
By Direct Debit ("DD") or Automated Clearing House ("ACH") payments:</li>
<ul>
<li>7.2.1.
This option is not available to You if You are a Sole Trader or personal customer.</li>
<li>7.2.2.
In certain regions (as may be notified to You at the time of placing the Order) it is an option for You to make the Lodgment by way of DD/ACH payment, however We are under no obligation to provide You with this option and require that You make at least one transfer by the means set out at Clause 7.1.
</li>
<li>7.2.3.
It is imperative that You ensure that all details supplied by You on the direct debit mandate agreements or ACH equivalent (the "Mandate") are correct and valid, and that only authorized signatories on the Your Funding Account have signed this Mandate, and confirm You shall indemnify Us for any losses incurred by Us as a result of errors made by You on the mandate.</li>
<li>7.2.4.
You are obliged to ensure that (1) there are sufficient funds in Your Funding Account to meet the direct debit payment and (2) sufficient funds remain in Your Funding Account until the direct debit has cleared and settled in to the TransferMate Nominated Account.
If a Lodgment by way of DD/ACH does not reach Transfermate Nominated Account due to insufficient funds or for any other reason, You must then complete the Lodgment by way of wire transfer to Us so that the Lodgment is not delayed.
Transfermate shall never facilitate a shortfall from You, nor do we offer any credit facility where You are delayed in completing a Lodgment.</li>
<li>7.2.5.
We reserve the right to revoke the option of making Lodgments by DD/ACH payments where any DD/ACH payment made by You is reversed from the Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>
<li>7.2.6.
We reserve the right to limit the amount of funds to be taken by Mandate.</li>
<li>7.2.7.
If a DD Mandate is inactive for a period of 9 months or more, We reserve the right to deactivate the option to pay by DD/ACH without prior notice to You or to request You to update the Mandate.</li>
<li>7.2.8.
In order to cancel a Mandate, You must contact Your bank to cancel.
Transfermate cannot do this on Your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<li>7.3.
Other than by availing of the means set out at Clauses 7.1 and 7.2, no other means is available for funding the Transfermate Nominated Account.
Specifically We do not accept cash, cheques or any equivalent.
Any attempts by You to make the Lodgment by any such prohibited means shall be invalid under the Contract, causing a delay and potentially a breach of the Contract.</li>
<li>7.4.
Unless otherwise agreed with You, We do not have nor do We request, any access to the Funding Account and shall not unilaterally debit funds from Your Funding Account.
You must initiate the Lodgment to the Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>
<li>7.5.
We reserve the right to reject funding from sources that We may reasonably believe or suspect may breach the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction, or that would meet the standards in Our Anti-Money Laundering Policy.</li>
<li>7.6.
You agree and acknowledge that We may refuse to accept or return any payment of money from a third party or from any account of a third party, and that Transfermate does not accept liability or responsibility for any loss, cost or expense incurred or suffered by You in connection with such non-acceptance or return, including because You are subsequently in default of your obligations to Us.</li>
<li>7.7.
In the event that We have completed the Final Transfer before receiving cleared and settled funds from You, including for example where a DD/ACH payment is reversed, a DD request is cancelled or a payment is disputed , You will be liable to pay Us the amount of the Final Transfer plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum.</li>
<li>7.8.
Transfermate is not responsible for any fees or charges that may be imposed by the financial institutions associated with the payment facilities You nominate.
</li>
</ul>
<strong>8.
Reactive Payments</strong>
<ul>
<li>8.1.
In certain circumstances We may contact You by email, or such other means as are open to Us (the <strong>"Collection Email"</strong>), on behalf of a third party (the <strong>"Biller"</strong>) who has requested that We provide You with an option to discharge an invoice (meaning for this purpose an invoice, bill or other contractual debt due to the Biller) by way of the Transaction Service.
Alternatively, the Collection Email may be issued to You directly by the Biller.
This Collection Email typically includes a link to a secure section of the Website (the <strong>"Portal"</strong>) and a request for You from, or on behalf of, the Biller to make a Reactive Payment in order to settle the invoice from the Biller;</li>
<li>8.2.
You are under no obligation to Us to make the Reactive Payment – this is a matter between You and the Biller.
However should You wish to make the Reactive Payment, it is incumbent on You to ensure that You make it in the currency quoted on the Portal and a failure to do this shall result in the Payment Transaction being rejected, a potential breach of Your obligation to the Biller to discharge the invoice, and Your incurring additional fees and charges if We are required to perform an additional currency exchange.</li>
<li>8.3.
If You are satisfied to make the Reactive Payment, You are required to go to the Portal or take such other steps as specified in the Collection Email and complete the Payment Transaction by strictly adhering to the requirements detailed by Us on the Portal or within the Collection Email.</li>
<li>8.4.
You may be required to open an Account with Us in accordance with Clause 4 before making the Reactive Payment.
We shall make it clear at the time of opening the Account whether the steps You are asked to undertake enable You to make a single Reactive Payment only, in some case without a foreign exchange element, or whether in undertaking the steps, You have effectively opened an Account with Us, enabling You to make full use of the Transaction Service.</li>
<li>8.5.
The options available to You as to how You make the Reactive Payment shall vary according to the instructions of the Biller, the applicable currency and Your location.
We make no warranty or commitment as to the specific steps required to make a Reactive Payment.
These shall be explained on the Portal and/or the Collection Email.</li>
</ul>
<strong>9.
Charges, Interest and Exchange rates</strong>
<ul>
<li>9.1.
The current charges, interest and other fees, applicable to the Transaction Service are set out the Standard Fee Schedule.</li>
<li>9.2.
We reserve the right to make changes to the Standard Fee Schedule from time to time and You will be asked to confirm Your agreement with the fees applicable prior to the entry of the Contract.</li>
<li>9.3.
The then in force Standard Fee Schedule shall apply to each Contract You enter with Us, however a Contract already entered will not be impacted if changes to the Standard Fee Schedule take effect after the date the Contract is entered.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>10.1.

Telephone calls (which for this purpose includes calls on fixed landlines, Skype calls or mobile lines) with You are typically recorded to protect both Your and Our own interests in the event of a dispute and You consent to such recordings being made.
For technical reasons it is not always possible for Us to record all telephone calls.
The telephone recordings will, where available and once a transcript is furnished to You following prior request, be accepted as evidence of the instructions or communications recorded, and may be used as evidence in any dispute, action, proceedings involving the use by You of the Transaction Service.
The absence of a telephone call recording shall not be deemed as detrimental in any such dispute, and in such circumstances, We are entitled to rely on an undisputed Booking Confirmation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10.2.
User Set Up and Monitoring: <ul>
<li>10.2.1.
Before getting access to the Transaction Service, You shall notify Us of the Users that You require to be set up on the Transaction Service, unless You are a Sole Trader or personal customer, in which case it is understood that the only User of the Transaction Service shall be You, unless You place a request to the contrary.</li>
<li>10.2.2.
All Users must be approved and registered by Us before using the Transaction Service.
Access to the Transaction Service shall be restricted to approved Users and We reserve the right at any time to refuse the appointment or continuation of a User without reason.</li>

<li>10.2.5.

<p>
<strong>Schedule 2: </strong>
<strong>Anti-Money Laundering Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>Words not defined here shall have the meaning set out in the Transfermate Standard Terms and Conditions (<u>here</u>)</p>
<p>Money laundering is the process by which criminally obtained money or other assets are exchanged for "clean" money with no obvious link to its criminal origin.
By preventing money laundering, the movement of funds derived from criminal activities will be inhibited.
This will in turn, restrict the availability of funds used for terrorist activities.
Transfermate views Money Laundering as a serious criminal offence, and as such, complies with regulatory requirements intended to forestall and prevent money laundering.
These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirming the identity of Our clients.</li>
<li>Retaining transaction and identification records for a minimum period of five years.</li>
<li>Training staff in terms of anti-money laundering regulations.</li>
<li>Appointing a nominated officer responsible for monitoring and reporting any and all suspicious activities to the relevant authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that Transfermate reserves the right to refuse a transaction at any time should suspicion arise that it may be connected to money laundering or any other criminal activity.
In addition, Transfermate will be obliged to report this suspicious activity and in line with regulations, is prohibited from disclosing this to the client.</p>
<p>By providing Us with false identification or contact details, We will deem this a misuse of the Transaction Service.
We are legally bound to report such misdemeanors to the relevant authorities, and as such, You may be the subject of a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Transfermate will NOT do business with anyone suspected of, or directly involved in Money Laundering, or where funds have been sourced by any illegal activity.</p>
<p>To assist the world wide fight against the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, worldwide laws require Transfermate to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person or corporate who opens an account with Us.
This can be done in many ways, some of which may require You to provide documentation.
Below are examples of documentation that may be required.
Your customer service representative will guide You through this process.</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples of Information required - natural persons</strong>
<br>When You open an Account, You <u>will</u> be asked for information such as Your name, date of birth, residential address, nationality, identification numbers, employment details and source of funds.
To verify this information, Transfermate uses the latest available technology, but You <u>may be</u> asked for identification documents such as, certified copies of documents showing nationality, residence, Your residential address and a photograph of You.
Typical verification documents are Your passport/drivers license plus a utility bill/bank/ credit card statement.</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples of Information required - Corporates</strong>
<br>When You open an Account, a corporation, partnership, trust or other legal entity may need to provide other information, such as its principal place of business, local office company registration and employer registration number.
To verify this information, Transfermate uses the latest available technology but You may be asked for certified articles of incorporation, government-issued business license, a partnership agreement or a trust agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>Certification</strong>
<br>If You are required to provide certified copy documents, they must be current, clear and legible, of good quality, signed and dated with the words "True copy of the original" (or similar) and can be certified by the following people: accountant, lawyer, police officer or Your bank manager.
If You cannot get one of these people, Your customer relationship representative will work with You to find an appropriate substitute.
Any foreign document(s) provided must be translated in English Language by a suitably qualified translator.
The person certifying or translating the document(s) should be contactable so please write their name and contact details on the copy of the document.

<p>
<u>Your Customer Service Representative will contact You to assist You with this process</u>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What happens if I don’t provide the information requested or my identity can’t be verified?&nbsp;</strong>
<br> We may not be able to open an Account or carry out transactions for You.

This offer must be accepted by You, by approving the Receivables Transaction, following which a legal contract is formed between the You and Transfermate, subject to these Receivables Terms (the "<strong>Receivables Contract</strong>").</li>
<li>3.3.
Our commitment under the Receivables Contract is to issue the Collection Email (as defined in the General Terms and Conditions) and to engage with a Payer on Your behalf is conditional on Your understanding that We: <ul>
<li>3.3.1.
have liberty to use whatever means We deem appropriate to carry out Your instruction;</li>
<li>3.3.2.
may require a copy of the Invoice for prior to completion of the Receivables Transaction, notwithstanding that We do not require this at from You when uploading the documents and information set out at Clause 3.1.</li>
<li>3.3.3.
do not pursue Payers beyond providing them with means of making a payment to You;</li>
<li>3.3.4.
cannot compel a Payer to participate in the Receivables Transaction;</li>
<li>3.3.5.
may conclude following a review of the Receivables Transaction, that We cannot accept funds from the Payer, whether for regulatory reasons or as a result of our risk appetite;</li>
<li>3.3.6.
act on Your behalf as a collection agent or similar mandated under the Power of Attorney, and only have a right to engage with the Payer while You authorize Us to do so, and as long as You do not revoke that authorization;</li>
<li>3.3.7.
shall ensure that funds received from the Payer are lodged to the Virtual Account or to the Receivables Account (if applicable) in accordance with Clause 7.
and</li>
<li>3.3.8.
shall issue receipt confirmation on Your behalf to the Payer on receipt of the Lodgment, stating that the Payer's financial obligation to You is satisfied, provided that the Payer does not issue a recall as explained in Clause 6.3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>4.
Engagement with the Payer</strong>
<ul>
<li>4.1.
Failure by You to notify the Payer of (i) Your reliance on the Receivables Transaction to discharge an Invoice and (ii) the impact to You of the Payer not making the Lodgment to Us, is likely to impact on the effectiveness of the Receivables Transaction.
We do not prescribe the means by which such notification should be made by You.</li>
<li>4.2.
You may request that We send Payers the Collection Email on Your behalf and provide them with the Invoice Reference in order that they can discharge invoices to You.
In such a scenario, We shall always need You to upload the Invoice.</li>
<li>4.3.
You have the option of requesting that Your Portal’s URL is attached to the Collection Email, by inter-alia adding it to the invoice(s) template from Your accounting software.
In addition, You have the option of using Your logo on the Collection Email.
These options shall be available to You to select on the Portal, however the options may not be possible on every Collection Email.</li>
<li>4.4.
As part of issuing the Collection Email, We will set out the means by which the Payer can comply with the Receivables Transaction, and any documentation required from the Payer in order to allow the Payer participate in the Receivables Transaction.</li>
<li>4.5.
If the Payer notifies Us that they do not wish to engage in the Receivables Transaction, You shall be updated within 2 Business Days of Our being made aware, and You may be asked to make good any loss caused to Us as a result (as set out in Clause 6).</li>
</ul>
<strong>5.
Limitations on the Receipt of Funds</strong>
<ul>
<li>5.1.
The Portal is intended to contain a list of the countries into which We are able to send Invoices on Your behalf and also available the currencies.
While We make reasonable efforts to manage this listing, We do not warrant that this listing is current or accurate.</li>
<li>5.2.
In some circumstances, We may not be able to collect from a country or in a currency notwithstanding what has been set out on the Portal, or We may be prohibited from dealing with a particular Payer as set out in Clause 3.3.5.
We hereby reserve <u>Our right to bring this limitation or restriction to Your attention after the Receivables Contract has been entered without incurring any liability on Our part, and as such Our ability to fulfil the Receivables Contract is conditional on Us being able to receive funds from a proposed Payer or from a Payer’s country or denominated in a specific currency</u> from the time the Receivables Contract is entered until the funds from the Payer have been received by Us.</li>
<li>5.3.
In some countries there are regulatory or export restrictions on the frequency and value of funds that can be remitted from that country at one time in a single transaction.
Transfermate continually monitors these restrictions and makes reasonable efforts to notify You prior to entering the Receivables Transaction where the limit may impact on our ability to perform the Contract.
However where We are prevented by such restriction from performing the Contract, We shall have no liability to You for any loss or damage You may incur as a result.
We shall notify You of the restriction and offer You the option to cancel the Receivables Transaction or amend the amount being sought.
It is always Your obligation to be aware of the applicable laws and restrictions attaching to the remittance of funds from the Payer and the Payer’s country of residence.</li>
</ul>
<strong>6.
Your Legal Liability as a result of entering a Receivables Contract</strong>
<ul>
<li>6.1.
If You, as part of entering the Receivables Contract, require Us to book an FX rate (for example to enable the Payer pay Us in the Payer’s local currency), then We shall be required to acquire currency in the event that the Payer commits to discharging the Invoice.
<u>This creates a legal obligation on You to ensure that the Payer makes the Lodgment to conclude the Receivables Transaction</u>, and in the event that there is a failure by the Payer to make the Lodgment in full and by the Settlement Date, this shall be a breach of Your obligations under the Receivables Contract.
In such event, We will close out the Order at its then prevailing market rates and <u>any FX loss, costs or other damages incurred by Us (collectively a "Loss") as a result shall be recoverable in full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>
<li>6.2.
In certain scenarios, as will be notified to You prior to entering the Contract, We acquire the currency immediately following the entry of the Contract, and in that event, even where the Payer does not make a commitment to Us to discharge the Invoice on the Portal, We may incur a Loss.
This Loss shall be recoverable in <u>full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>
<li>6.3.
The default means for Payer making a Lodgment are set out on the Portal and may be fixed by You prior to entering the Contract.
Where the Payer is limited to making the Lodgment by wire only, then subject to Clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 herein, You assume no additional liability.
However in the event that You determine that the Payer may make the Lodgment by way of Direct Debit / ACH or by credit / debit card, then there is a risk that the Payer may recall the funds from Us after we have made the Final Transfer to You, causing a Loss to Us.
In such an event You agree to transfer the amount of the Final Transfer on demand from Us.</li>
<li>6.4.
You confirm that You have obtained whatever Payer consent is required in accordance with the applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws to permit Us to contact the Payers, and in the event that We incur a Loss as a result of Your failure to comply with these applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws, that You shall indemnity Us in full for that Loss.</li>
<li>6.5.
Late or incomplete settlement of any of the Losses set out herein, shall incur default interest on the total amount due, at a compound rate of 5% per annum above the prime lending rate for the time being in force, calculated daily and payable to Us on the date payment is made.
</li>
</ul>
<strong>7.
Mass Uploads:</strong>
<ul>
<li>7.1.
In addition to uploading single Payment Transactions as set out in Clause 2.1, You have the option to upload a batch of transactions (this capability is known as a "<strong>Mass Upload</strong>").</li>
<li>7.2.
On request from You, We shall provide You with a template setting out the information required by Us to process a Mass Upload.</li>
<li>7.3.
You are required to follow this template and produce a statement listing the transaction requests for Mass Upload together with attaching invoice(s) in the following format.
PDF, DOCX, XLS, subject to file size limitation as detailed on the Portal.
Our requirements and supported formats may be modified by Us from time to time, and We reserve the right to notify You of any modified requirements during the Mass Upload process.</li>
<li>7.4.
We shall validate that the uploaded file contains the necessary information for Mass Uploads, engage with You where there are errors on the uploaded file, and confirm details of the successful Mass Upload when applicable.</li>
<li>7.5.
The payment request can be authorised and the Payer contacted once You authorise same by way of tick box confirmation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>8.
Receiving the Funds from the Payer</strong>
<ul>
<li>8.1.
On Our receipt of funds from Payer We shall provide You with email confirmation within 1 Business Day that a specific Invoice Reference has been discharged pursuant to a Receivables Transaction.</li>
<li>8.2.
Unless You provide Us with any instruction to the contrary with regard to these funds, they will be retained by Us in the Virtual Account, in the currency set on that Virtual Account.
The decision to use a Virtual Account instead of nominating a Receivables Account is a matter for You and We cannot advise You on the wisest course of action for Your needs.
There are risks associated with the use of a Virtual Account and You are advised to seek independent legal and financial advice should You wish to retain funds in a Virtual Account, in particular if You do not have a specific purpose in mind for the onward use of those funds.</li>
<li>8.3.
Following a specific request from You We shall transfer the funds into Your Receivables Account.
You may make this request while the funds are in the Virtual Account or prior to the Payer making the Lodgment.
We shall make this transfer within 1 to 2 Business Days of receiving the cleared and settled funds from the Payer.
The transfer into the Receivables Account shall specify the name of the Payer and the Invoice Reference to enable You identify the Payment Transaction.</li>
</ul>
