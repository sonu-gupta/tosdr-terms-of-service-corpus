(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim.
and (iii) all necessary cooperation of BrowserStack at Customer’s expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, BrowserStack may participate in the defense of any claim by counsel of its own choosing, at its cost and expense and Customer will not settle any claim without BrowserStack’s prior written consent, unless the settlement fully and unconditionally releases BrowserStack and does not require BrowserStack to pay any amount, take any action, or admit any liability.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>DATA PROTECTION.</strong>
<p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), the data protection terms relating to processing of Account-Related Information and Customer Content are contained in Exhibit A (Data Protection Addendum).

<p>Browserstack is currently in compliance with and shall at all times remain in compliance with the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the Department of the Treasury and any statute, executive order, or other governmental action relating thereto.
In accordance with the regulations, BrowserStack does not offer services to users in specific sanctioned regions and hence does not allow users in such regions to access all of certain parts of the website, including certain products.

<li>
<strong>Fees and Payment.</strong> All fees are as set forth in the applicable Order Form and are due within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice .

Customers are required to pay any use, withholding, or similar taxes (including reverse charge with respect to GST and VAT) or levies, whether domestic or foreign as may be applicable, other than taxes based on the income of BrowserStack.
Any late payments will be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.<br>BrowserStack may change the fees in effect or add new fees and charges from time to time.

BrowserStack may, in its sole discretion, offer Customer a grace-period in which their fees will not increase for a certain period of time.
If Customer does not accept the increase or addition to the existing fees, Customer may elect to terminate its account during the then current billing period and Customer shall not be liable for such fee increase after the applicable billing period.
however, any later renewal of service will be subject to the increased fee structure.</li>
<li>
<strong>Suspension of Service.</strong>&nbsp;In addition to any of BrowserStack’s other rights or remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), BrowserStack reserves the right to suspend Customer’s access to the Services if: (i) Customer’s account is thirty (30) days or more overdue.
(ii) BrowserStack determines that Customer has breached Section 2.3 (General Restrictions) or Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations).
or (iii) BrowserStack determines that suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other customers or third parties, or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Services.
BrowserStack will have no liability for taking action as permitted above in this section.
However, unless this Agreement has been terminated, BrowserStack will cooperate with Customer to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Customer has resolved the condition requiring suspension.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</strong>
<p>Each party (as “<strong>Receiving Party</strong>”) agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (“<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>”) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“<strong>Confidential Information</strong>”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.
Any BrowserStack Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of BrowserStack without any marking or further designation.
Customer Content will be deemed Confidential Information of Customer without the need for any marking or further designation.
Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.
The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for BrowserStack, its subcontractors), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 11 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 11.
The Receiving Party’s confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.
(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.
(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.
or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.
The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by administrative or judicial process, applicable law, or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.
The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>
