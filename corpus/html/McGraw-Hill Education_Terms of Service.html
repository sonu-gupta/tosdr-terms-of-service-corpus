<b>INDEMNIFICATION.</b>
</p>
<p>McGraw Hill shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Subscriber from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, related to or arising out of any claim by a third party that the technology platform underlying the Solution infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of such third party.
To the extent permitted by law, Subscriber shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless McGraw Hill and its parent, affiliates, successors and assigns and their respective officers, employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, related to or arising out of use of the Solution by Subscriber, except to the extent that such claim is subject to indemnification by McGraw Hill hereunder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>MISCELLANEOUS.</b>
</p>
<p>The Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and commitments with respect thereto.
provided, however, that if Subscriber has entered into a separate written agreement with McGraw Hill regarding the subject matter hereof, that agreement will supersede this Agreement to the extent of any conflict.
There are no other oral or written understandings, terms or conditions with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement, and neither party has relied upon any representation, express or implied, not contained in the Agreement.
The rights and remedies of the parties are cumulative and not alternative.
No waiver of any rights is to be charged against any party unless such waiver is in writing signed by an authorized representative of the party so charged.
Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under the Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.
No modification of or amendment to the Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties.
If any provision of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and, if legally permitted, such offending provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision that as nearly as possible effects the parties' intent.
Subscriber may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under the Agreement without the prior written consent of McGraw Hill, which consent McGraw Hill may grant or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.
Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.
Any purported or attempted assignment or other transfer or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void.</p>
