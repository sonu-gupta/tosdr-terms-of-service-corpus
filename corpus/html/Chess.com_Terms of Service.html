(2) A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST US.
(3) AND A RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE.</p> Arbitration, Controlling Law, and Jurisdiction <p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>
<p>If you have any dispute with Chess.com that relates in any way to these Terms of Service or from access to or use of our Service, then both of us agree to pursue a resolution in the following manner:</p> 1.
Informal Resolution <p>You will first contact us at https://support.chess.com/ to give us Notice of your dispute and attempt to resolve it with us informally.
Your Notice must include your name, any relevant account name you use, your address, how to contact you, your problem, and what you want us to do.
We will attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute for at least thirty (30) days from the date you first contact our support group.
If we are unable to resolve the dispute informally, then we will pursue a resolution in the following manner:</p> 2.
Arbitration <p>The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal arbitration law shall apply to these Terms of Service.</p> Arbitration Procedure <p>You must deliver a Notice of Intent to Arbitrate by certified mail using the U.S.
Postal Service to: Chess.com, Legal, 877 E 1200 S #970397, Orem, UT 84907.
Your Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of your claim.
and (b) set forth the specific relief you seek.</p>
<p>You then will submit any claim to final and binding arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), using its applicable Commercial Arbitration Rules and Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement.
The AAA Rules are found at http://www.adr.org.</p>
<p>The Arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement.
AAA and the Arbitrator will conduct all phases of the proceeding in English.
The Arbitrator will conduct the hearing virtually but, if the parties agree that an in-person hearing is necessary, then the Arbitrator will conduct the hearing either in Utah County, Utah or the county where you reside.
You may choose between the two locations.</p>
<p>Any decision or award will include a written statement which sets forth the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the Arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.</p>
<p>The Arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by you or Chess.com to satisfy one of our individual claims (and which the Arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).
The Arbitrator may not award relief against Chess.com respecting any person other than you.</p>
<p>If necessary, either party may submit any arbitration decision or award to any court of competent jurisdiction to be enforced as a final judgment.</p> Arbitration Fees, Costs, and Attorney’s Fees <p>If you seek a remedy in the amount of $10,000 or less, then Chess.com will promptly reimburse your filing fee and your share, if any, of AAA’s arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation (unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous or were filed for harassment).
If you seek a remedy of more than $10,000 – or if the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules do not apply – then AAA will split the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, between you and Chess.com, according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.</p>
<p>The Arbitrator shall issue no arbitration award that requires one party to pay the attorney’s fees of the other, unless the Arbitrator finds that the party’s claims were frivolous or brought to harass the other.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking relief either in small claims court (for eligible claims) or injunctive or other equitable relief from the civil courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Service.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND CHESS.COM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION CLAIM.</p>
<p>ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.</p>
<p>If for any reason a dispute between you and Chess.com proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, then the laws of the State of Utah and the FAA will govern, without regard to or application of any conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, any such dispute will be brought solely in the U.S.
District Court located in Salt Lake County, Utah or the Utah State District Court in Utah County, Utah, United States.
You consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection that it is an inconvenient forum.</p> 3.
Alternative Dispute Resolution <p>If your dispute pertains to a Chess.com finding that you violated its Fair Play Policy then, if you do not wish to submit it for arbitration with AAA, you may choose to submit it, instead, for final and binding arbitration with a Fair Play Panel of Experts.
This panel will conduct its hearing using AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by the Arbitration provisions in Section 2 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Chess.com will pay all of the fees and costs associated with this Fair Play Panel proceeding (except for your attorney’s fees).
Both you and Chess.com will remain responsible for their own attorney’s fees under all circumstances, no matter who prevails in this proceeding.</p>
<p>The Fair Play Panel will consist of three persons chosen by you and Chess.com from a panel of candidates, each of whom is either a recognized expert in the field of chess cheat detection or has obtained (and currently holds) at least the title of Chess International Master.
