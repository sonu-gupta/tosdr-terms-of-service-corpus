By participating in the prize draw, the participant agrees with these Conditions of Participation.
The decisions of the organiser in all matters pertaining to this prize draw are final and binding.<br>

The more reviews you submit, the greater our chance of winning will be.
<br>
<br>
Participation shall be electronically logged by the organiser.<br>
<br>
In the case of a dispute concerning participation, the legitimate owner of the email address that was used to register shall be regarded as the participant.
The “legitimate owner” is the natural person to whom an email address is assigned by an internet service provider, online service provider or other organisation responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address.
The potential winners may be requested to provide the organiser with verification that they are the legitimate owner, or otherwise lose their claim on the prize.<br>
<br>
Participants are personally responsible for the accuracy of their data, in particular their email and postal addresses.
Participation with invalid/incomplete data, for example non-functioning or inactive email addresses shall lead to disqualification.<br>

<br>
The prizes presented as part of the prize draw may differ with regard to colour, model, technical equipment or the like, but will be of comparable value and involve equivalent equipment.
The prizes may not be exchanged, are not transferable, cannot be paid in cash and no other prize can be chosen as a replacement.

<br>
The chance of winning a prize depends on the number of draw participants.<br>
<br>
<strong>Description of prizes</strong>
<br> One (1) arbitrarily drawn winner will win one (1) voucher valued at €1,000 or €100 from Thomann GmbH<br>
<br>
<strong>General conditions</strong>
<br>
The organiser reserves the right to end the prize draw at their own discretion at any time without advance notice.
This option is of particular use to the organiser in cases where the normal execution of the prize draw cannot be guaranteed due to technical or legal reasons.
In this case, the organiser reserves the right to draw the winner of the prize from amongst the eligible participants who had participated prior to the time of termination.<br>
<br>
The organiser also reserves the right, at their own discretion, to exclude persons from participation:<br>
<br> (a) for manipulation associated with access to or execution of the prize draw;<br> (b) for violations of these Conditions of Participation;<br> (c) for unfair conduct;<br> (d) for incorrect or misleading statements associated with participation in this prize draw.<br>
<br>
Should a person attempt to compromise the legitimate operation of the prize draw, e.g.
using technical aids, this may present a violation of criminal or civil law.
Should a person attempt such a thing, the organiser reserves the right to seek damages through legal means and withdraw or demand the return of prizes.
The failure to enforce any provision in these official Conditions of Participation shall not constitute the organiser’s waiver of that provision.<br>
<br>
<strong>Data protection</strong>
<br>
The participant agrees that the organiser shall store all data required for the execution of the prize draw for the duration of the prize draw.
In the case of a win, the organiser reserves the right to publish the given names and surnames (shortened to initials) of the winner along with their place of residence on the www.thomann.de website, in the newsletter and/or on social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Google).
The participant may object to their data being published after being notified of the win at any time by email to marketing@thomann.de, or by post to the organiser’s address provided in this section.<br>
<br>
The organiser has assigned services necessary for the execution and settlement of the prize draw in part to third parties (cooperation partners).
Participants’ data shall be stored by the cooperation partner/s for the purposes of executing and settling the prize draw for the duration of the prize draw.
All data shall be deleted after the end and settlement of the prize draw.<br>
<br>
<strong>By participating in this prize draw, the participant agrees to the use of their data by third parties for the stated purposes and, in particular, transmission of their data to third parties by the organiser.</strong>
<br>
<br>
The participants may revoke their permission for their data to be used at any time.
By revoking this permission, the participant withdraws their participation in the prize draw.
Furthermore, through the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG), the participant has the guaranteed rights to information and – provided that the legal requirements for such action have been met (cf.
§ 35 BDSG) – correction, blocking or deletion of collected data.<br>
<br>
The stated rights can be exercised by sending a notification via post to: <br>
<br> Thomann GmbH<br> c/o Data Privacy Officer<br> Hans-Thomann-Straße 1<br> 96138 Burgebrach<br> Germany<br>
<br>
The organiser undertakes to protect the privacy of the participants and ensures that the data shall be used pursuant to the German Federal Data Protection Act, the German Telemedia Act, European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and EU directive 02/58/EC.
In this context, particular reference is made to the organiser’s general data protection provisions.<br>
<br>
<strong>Liability</strong>
<br>
With the fulfilment or handover of the prize to the participant, the organiser shall be released from all obligations, insofar as the organiser, depending on the nature of the prize draw, has any legal obligation towards the participant.<br>
<br>
Warranty claims on winnings that are provided by cooperation partners for the prize draw shall be asserted exclusively against the cooperation partners.<br>
<br>
According to legal provisions, the organiser shall assume liability in the case of fraudulent intent, wilful intent or gross negligence.
Damages caused by the organiser as a result of ordinary negligence shall only be compensated if there is breach of a material obligation, the breach of which jeopardises the achievement of the purpose of the contract and/or the fulfilment of which is necessary for the execution and settlement of the prize draw and on the fulfilment of which the participants may regularly depend (cardinal obligation).<br>
<br>
The organiser assumes no liability for the insolvency of a cooperation partner or the consequences this may have on the execution and settlement of the prize draw.
The decisions of the organiser in all matters pertaining to the relevant prize draw are final and binding.
The organiser reserves the right to correct printing errors or mechanical errors.<br>
<br>
The organiser accepts no responsibility for lost, damaged, illegible, incomplete or late registrations, regardless of whether this is due to delay in delivery or incompleteness due to system errors.
Furthermore, the organiser accepts no responsibility for registration that is not received or not fully received due to circumstances of force majeure, such as traffic congestion, unauthorised intervention by third parties, malfunctions of computer and telecommunications systems or inaccurate or failed recording of incoming data transfers.
Proof of transfer is not deemed to be proof of receipt by the organiser.
The winner is personally responsible for all applicable taxes, duties and fees not specified in these Conditions of Participation.<br>
<br>
<strong>Other</strong>
<br>
All decisions are final.
The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany are exclusively applicable to the exclusion of referral provisions under German international private law.
Should the participant also be the consumer, this only applies to the extent that they do not lose the protection of binding legal provisions of their state of usual residence.
Should individual provisions of these Conditions of Participation be or become invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected by this.

<strong>Personal data / types of use</strong>

<p>As a principle, the protection of your personal data is of highest priority for Musikhaus Thomann.
You decide whether or not you wish to make such data known to us, for example in the course of any registration, survey or the like.
Such information on your part is relevant for your enquiry, but you provide it on a voluntary basis.
An exception to this rule is when prior consent cannot be obtained for practical reasons and the processing of data is permitted by law.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</strong>
</p>
<p>If we obtain the consent of the data subject to process their personal data, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.</p>
<p>When processing personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.
This also applies to any processing required to perform pre-contractual measures.</p>
<p>If processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Musikhaus Thomann is subject, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.</p>
<p>In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person necessitate the processing of personal data, Article 6 (1)(d) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.</p>
<p>If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or of a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis for processing.</p>
<p>The legal basis for and more information about data processing using cookies on our website can be found in the section on cookies.</p>

<strong>Data deletion and storage duration</strong>
</p>
<p>The data subject’s personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply.
Data may be stored beyond this if provisions have been made for this by the European or national legislator in Union regulations, laws or other rules to which the controller is subject.
Data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the standards mentioned above expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Exchange of data / contractual relationships with partners / third parties</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to the types of use described above, Musikhaus Thomann will transfer your data to third parties that are involved in the processing of your order or that participate in contracts.
For example, if you place an order via our website, we will transmit your order information to Musikhaus Thomann’s partner companies and contractors who process and deliver your order to you.
Data will only be transmitted to the extent required in order to fulfil or deliver your order or to process an enquiry.
The legal basis for this is the fulfilment of the contract concluded with you (e.g.
for orders) or the initiation of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).</p>
<p>We will also transmit personal data to third parties where we are required to do so by law.
The legal basis in this instance is Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Data automatically collected on our website / usage data</strong>
</p>
<p>We welcome anybody to visit and use our website free of charge and to look at the products on offer.
When you visit our website, we record the following general usage data in order to assess which parts of our website you visit and how long you stay there:</p>
<ol>
<li> Information about the browser type and version used</li>
<li> The user’s operating system</li>
<li> The user’s IP address</li>
<li> Date and time of access</li>
<li> Websites from which the user’ system reaches our website</li>
<li> The services and functions used on our website</li>
</ol>
<p>Such data will be combined with the usage data of all visitors to our website in order to measure the number of visitors, the average time of the visits, pages visited, etc.
The data we collect is combined and used for internal purposes only.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
<p>We use this combined data for evaluating our products, services and the news we make available via our website, as well as for monitoring use of our website and generally improving its content.</p>
<p>The temporary storage of IP addresses by the system is required in order to enable the delivery of the website to the user’s computer.
To do this, the user’s IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.</p>
<p>Data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website.
In addition, we use the data to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
These purposes are also the basis for our legitimate interests in data processing pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.
If data is stored in log files, this is the case after no more than seven days.
Further storage is possible.
In this case, the users’ IP addresses are deleted or distorted, so that it is no longer possible to associate them with the calling client.</p>
<p>The collection of data in order to provide the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website.
Therefore the user cannot opt out.</p>
<p>Third party advertisements or links to other websites displayed on our website may collect user data if you click on them or otherwise follow their instructions.
We have no control over the data collected either voluntarily or involuntarily via advertisements or websites of third parties.
We recommend that you read the privacy policies of the promoted websites if you have any concerns regarding the collection and use of your data.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>Like many other commercial websites, Musikhaus Thomann sometimes uses the technology known as “cookies” to collect information on how you use the website, and to ensure your visit runs smoothly.</p>
<p>Cookies are text files that are stored in the Internet browser or come from the Internet browser on the user’s computer system.
When a user visits a website, a cookie may be stored on the user’s operating system.
This cookie contains a distinctive string that allows the browser to be uniquely identified when the website is visited again.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies cannot read any information from your computer or interact with other cookies on your hard disk.
However, cookies enable us to recognize you when you revisit our website.</strong>
<br>
<strong>You can find the data that has been stored in cookies in the cookie settings.</strong>
<br> Our website makes use of transient cookies, persistent cookies, tracking/web bugs and local storage.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Transient and persistent cookies</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transient cookies </strong>are automatically erased when you close your browser.
These include in particular the session cookie.
These store a so-called session ID, with which various requests from your browser can be assigned to the joined session.
This enables our website to recognise your computer when you return.
Sessions cookies are erased when you close your browser.</p>
<p>We use transient cookies to make our websites more user-friendly.
Some elements on our website require the browser to be identified even after you have moved to a different page.</p>
<p>Our website also uses <strong>persistent cookies</strong> that enable analysis of the browsing behaviour of our users.
Persistent cookies are automatically erased after a prescribed period, which may vary depending on the cookie.
They enable transmission of, for example, IP addresses and search terms entered, as well as the use of certain website functions.</p>
<p>Most cookies do not save a user’s personal data.
However, the user’s email address and customer ID could be stored on the server in addition to the cookie ID.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>
<em>Tracking/web bugs</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Some of our services also use “tracking bugs”, “web bugs” or “tracking pixels”.
This involves code snippets that are usually only 1x1 pixel in size and can identify and detect your browser via the browser ID – your browser’s individual “fingerprint”.
These enable the service provider to see how many users have accessed the pixel and if and when an email has been opened or a website has been visited.</p>
<p>You can use tools such as webwasher, bugnosys and AdBlock to prevent web bugs on our website.
We will not use web bugs to secretly collect your personal data or share such data with third parties and marketing platforms without your express consent.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Purposes of and legal basis for the use of cookies and other identifiers</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>The legal basis for processing personal data using technically necessary cookies is Article 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
<p>The purpose of using technically essential cookies is to facilitate the use of websites for users.
Some features of our website cannot be provided without the use of cookies.
For these features, it is necessary to recognise the browser, even after moving to a different page.</p>
<p>The right to object is excluded for technically essential cookies as these are required to display the website and its contents and to make the functionalities of the website available to you.</p>
<p>The user data collected through technically necessary cookies is not used to create user profiles.</p>
<p>Analysis and marketing cookies are used to improve the quality of our website and its contents.
Analysis cookies allow us to ascertain how the website is used and thus constantly optimise our service.
To perform processing functions on your end device that are based on cookies or other identifiers (e.g.
browser fingerprints, pixels) and are not technically necessary for our website to function, we first require your consent, which you can give using the cookie pop-up that appears when you access our website.
The legal basis for this cookie-based processing is Article 6(1)(a) GDPR in conjunction with §12(1) TMG (German Telemedia Act), Article 5(3) ePrivacy Directive.
These types of cookies are not necessary for our website to function and will not be placed until you give your consent.</p>
<p>
</p>

The following data is collected during the registration process:</p>
<ol>
<li> First name and surname</li>
<li> Address</li>
<li> Email address</li>
<li> Company/institution/band (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>As part of the registration process, consent is obtained from the user to process this data.<br> The legal basis for processing data if the user’s consent is given is Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.<br> If the registration serves to fulfil a contract to which the user is party or to perform pre-contractual measures, the additional legal basis for the processing of data is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.<br> User registration is necessary in order to provide certain content and services on our website.<br> User registration is necessary in order to fulfil a contract with the user or to perform pre-contractual measures.<br> The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.<br> This is the case for data collected during the registration process if the registration for our website is cancelled or modified.<br> This is the case for data collected during the registration process for the purpose of fulfilling a contract or performing pre-contractual measures if the data is no longer necessary for the performance of the contract.
Even after the conclusion of the contract, there may be a need to store the contracting party’s personal data in order to comply with contractual or legal obligations.<br> As a user, you have the option to cancel your registration at any time.
The data stored about you can be modified at any time via customer support or the customer centre.<br> If the data is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract or for performing pre-contractual measures, premature deletion of the data is only possible if contractual or legal obligations do not preclude deletion.</p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Contact form and email contact</strong>
</p>
<p>Our website offers options to give feedback, to use live support and to leave notes/comments for orders.
If a user takes advantage of one of these options, the data entered on the input screen will be transmitted to us and stored.
This data includes:</p>
<p>1.
“Give feedback”: your message (if it contains voluntary information from you containing personal data), and email address (optional)<br> 2.
Live support and notes/comments on orders: only data that is required for your individual support request or that you voluntarily provide in your note/comment</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can contact us via the email addresses provided on our website.
In this case, the user’s personal data transmitted by email will be stored.</p>
<p>No data is passed on to third parties in this context.
The data is used exclusively for processing the conversation.</p>
<p>The legal basis for processing the data transmitted in the course of sending an email is Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR.
If the purpose of the email is to conclude a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing shall be Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.</p>
<p>The personal data from the input screen is only processed in order for us to process the contact.
In the event of contact via email, this is also the basis for the required legitimate interest in the processing of data.</p>
<p>Any other personal data processed during the sending process serves to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.</p>
<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.
For the personal data from the contact form input screen and the data sent by email, this is the case if the respective conversation with the user has ended.
The conversation is deemed to be ended if it can be inferred from the circumstances that the relevant facts have been conclusively clarified.</p>
<p>

<strong>Use of services for marketing and analysis purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Google Analytics</strong>
</p>
<p>Our website utilises Google Analytics, a web analytics tool by Google Inc.
(“Google”).
Google Analytics uses “cookies”, text files stored on your computer that enable analysis of how you use the website.
The cookie-generated information about your use of this website is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States.
However, if you are in a country that is a member state of the European Union or a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and if IP address anonymization has been activated on this website, Google will first truncate your IP address.
Only by way of exception will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there.
Google will use this information on our behalf for the purposes of analysing how you use the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing further services related to website and internet use to the website operator.
Google will not combine the IP address transmitted by your browser via Google Analytics with other Google data.
You can disable cookies by setting your browser accordingly.
however, if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
Furthermore, you can prevent collection and transfer of the data generated by cookies on www.thomann.de and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google, as well as the processing of such data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/eula.html?hl=en.</p>

</p>
<p>We would also like to point out that our website uses Google Analytics with the anonymizeIP extension so that IP addresses are only processed further in an abbreviated form to prevent them being directly linked to a particular individual.</p>
<p>More detailed information about the function of Google Analytics and the terms of use and privacy policy relevant to this service can be found under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html and http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Google Tag Manager</strong>
</p>
<p>We use Google Tag Manager to manage “website tags”.
Tags are small code elements on our website that run upon certain interactions with the website and send measured data to the third party programs used (e.g.
Google Analytics).
The Tag Manager itself does not use cookies and does not collect any personal data.
The Tag Manager triggers other tags that collect data and place cookies under certain circumstances (e.g.
the third party programs used).
The Tag Manager does not access this data.</p>
<p>

<strong>Embedding and use of links to social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)</strong>
</p>
<p>Links to external social network services such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are embedded on our website, in particular in the areas displaying our products.
The responsibility for the internet services of these social network services lies solely with their operators.
Below you will find further information, categorised according to the corresponding social network service.</p>

Data is only transmitted if you are logged into your user account of the corresponding social media service.
You can then link to or share content from our websites directly using the social media service, or you can watch the videos that are on our YouTube channel.
Under certain circumstances, the social media service may thus ascertain which content you have viewed on our website.</p>
<p>The responsibility for the social media services linked to by Musikhaus Thomann lies exclusively with:</p>

<strong>Facebook remarketing</strong>
</p>
<p>On our websites, we use the “Vanilla Custom Audiences Pixel”, a service provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”).
With the help of this service we can reach our customers directly through the Facebook network by showing “Facebook ads” to visitors of our website when they visit the social network Facebook.</p>
<p>To this end we have implemented the Facebook “remarketing pixel”.
This involves code snippets that are able to identify your browser via the browser ID – your browser’s individual fingerprint – and detect that you visited our website and what exactly you viewed there.
A direct connection to the Facebook servers is made when you visit our website.
Facebook is able to identify you using your browser-ID, as this is linked to other data saved to your Facebook user account.
Facebook then shows customised advertisements that are matched to your needs on your Facebook timeline or in another place on Facebook.</p>
<p>We at Thomann are not able to personally identify you via the Facebook pixel, because we do not save any personal data other than your browser ID using the Facebook remarketing pixel.<br> More information about Facebook Custom Audiences, the particulars of data processing using this service and Facebook’s data policy can be found at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.</p>

<strong>Google Ads Conversion Tracking</strong>
</p>
<p>Our website utilises the Google Ads Conversion Tracking function.
The provider of this service is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”).
If you click on an Ads advertisement placed by Google, a “conversion tracking cookie” will be stored on your computer.
This cookie is valid for 30 days and does not contain data that would allow us to identify you personally.</p>
<p>Conversion tracking allows us and Google to identify the Ads advertisements you have clicked on and whether you were forwarded to our website via an advertisement, if you visit our website and the cookie is still valid.
Google provides us with our own cookie, which is different from the cookies of other customers of this Google service, so that we can only implement a reach assessment with regard to our own cookies, and not across all websites of customers of the Google Ads service.
The cookie enables us to compile our own conversion statistics on customers that visit our website through Ads advertisements.</p>

<strong>DoubleClick and Google Ads Remarketing or “Similar Audiences”</strong>
</p>
<p>Our website utilises the DoubleClick Remarketing Pixel and Google Ads Remarketing or “Similar Audiences”.
The provider of both services is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”).
Using these services, we can show you advertisements associated with our online shop (e.g.
interesting product offers) on the websites of other service providers that also use these Google services (“partners” in the Google Display network).
Furthermore, we can use Google Ads Remarketing to place a message on the websites of other providers in the Google Display Network reminding you to complete your order if you have recently abandoned an order on our online shop.
This requires the use of cookie technology.</p>
<p>To this end, Google stores a small file containing a sequence of numbers (“cookie ID”) in your browser to identify you as a visitor to our website and collect other anonymous data about the use of our website.
The cookie ID is stored by us and used only to explicitly identify your browser and not to identify you as a person.
These services are not used to collect or store your personal data.</p>
<p>We use Google Remarketing across multiple devices.
This means, for example, that if you begin making a purchase from our online shop using your smartphone and complete it on your laptop, we can reach you with the abovementioned personalised advertisements on the other device you use.
However, this will only happen if you have given Google your consent for Google to link your web and app browsing history with your Google account, and for information from your Google account to be used to personalise the advertisements you see online.
In this instance, Google uses the data of this logged-in user together with Google analytics data to define and create audience lists for Remarketing across multiple devices.
Google Analytics collects this user’s Google-authenticated IDs to support this function.
This data from Google is temporarily linked with our Google Analytics data to create our audiences.</p>
<p>Please check the privacy settings in your Google account to prevent Google linking your web and app browsing history with your Google account.</p>
<p>No personal data will be transmitted to Google for the purpose of displaying a message reminding you of an abandoned order on our online shop.
Only the fact that you wanted to place an order on our online shop under the collected cookie ID and abandoned this order, as well as the total price of the intended order, will be transmitted to Google for this purpose (“shopping cart transfer”).</p>

<strong>Bing Ads</strong>
</p>
<p>Our website utilises “Bing Ads” remarketing technology.
The provider of this service is the Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA (“Microsoft”).
If you access our website via a Microsoft Bing advertisement, Microsoft places a cookie on your computer (“conversion cookie”).
This enables Microsoft and Bing Ads customers to identify that the advertisement has been clicked and a user has been forwarded to our website.
In this way, it is possible to address you once again with targeted product recommendations and interest-based advertising on Microsoft’s websites and the websites of other “Bing Ads” customers.<br> The information collected using the conversion cookie serves to create conversion statistics.
We learn the total number of users who have clicked on a Microsoft Bing advertisement and thus been forwarded to our website.
Other anonymous data (e.g.
the number of page views and the length of time spent on the website) is also collected.
We do not receive information that would allow us to identify users personally.</p>

<strong>Adform</strong>
</p>
<p>Our website utilises services for the purposes of retargeting and conversion tracking.
The provider of these services is Adform A/S, Wildersgade 10B, 1.
sal.
1408 Copenhagen, Denmark (“Adform”).
Using the Ad Serving service, we can show you advertisements associated with our online shop (e.g.
interesting product offers) on the websites of other service providers that also use Adform.
Ad Serving and the integrated conversion tracking function also enable us and Adform to identify the advertisements you have clicked on and whether you were forwarded to our website via an advertisement, if you visit our website.</p>
<p>To this end we have implemented the Adform pixel as an identifier.
This involves code snippets that are able to identify your browser via the browser ID – your browser’s individual fingerprint – and detect that you visited our website and what exactly you viewed there.
A direct connection to the Adform servers is made via the pixel when you visit our website.
Adform processes the data collected by the pixel in order to provide the abovementioned services.</p>
<p>We at Thomann are not able to personally identify you via the Adform pixel, because we do not save personal data other than your browser ID using the Adform pixel.</p>
<p>
<strong>Statutory right of withdrawal</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>You can find out how to withdraw your consent given using our cookie pop-up in the section <em>Withdrawal of consent to the use of cookies and other identifiers/tags.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Further information about Adform’s services, the details of data processing through these services and Adform’s privacy policy can be found at https://site.adform.com/privacy-center/platform-privacy/product-and-services-privacy-policy/.</p>

<strong>Embedded YouTube videos</strong>
</p>
<p>When you visit a website into which YouTube videos are embedded, Google receives information that you have accessed this website.
The data mentioned in the above section (“usage data”) is also transmitted.
This happens regardless of whether Google provides a user account that you can log into or whether no user account exists.
If you are logged into your Google account, your data will be directly associated with your account.
If you do not wish data to be associated with your Google profile, you must log out prior to visiting websites into which YouTube videos are embedded.</p>
<p>Google stores this data as a user profile and uses it for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-led configuration of its website.
Such evaluation takes place (even for users who are not logged in) for the purposes of demand-oriented advertising.
You can find more information in the Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the use of YouTube videos on our website is our legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR) in the demand-oriented, visually optimised presentation of our website, above all through the use of videos.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to object</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact Google in order to exercise this right.
You can use the privacy settings in your Google account to determine how Google can use your data for advertising or other purposes.
This includes settings determining the display of advertisements (“ads”).</strong>

<p>
<strong>Classified ads</strong>
</p>
<p>You can place classified ads on our website free of charge.
To this end, we collect your name, address and email address in a registration form.
These details will then be saved in our system and used for creating the classified ad.
Either your name or a pseudonym, as well as your country, city, postal code and email address will be published in the classified ad.
In addition, information regarding the description of the equipment, pictures uploaded by you and your telephone number (optional) will be part of the published classified ad.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
<p>This is to enable interested parties to contact you, and to prevent fraud.
Additionally, we compare the data provided by you for the placement of the classified ad with our customer database.
This is to correct any false customer data, and to assign the classified ad to a customer account (if you are already a customer of Musikhaus Thomann).
This enables you to comfortably administrate your classified ad via the regular Customer Centre log-in.</p>
<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.
This is the case for data collected during the registration process if the registration for our website is cancelled or modified.</p>
<p>As a user, you have the option to cancel your registration at any time.
The data stored about you can be modified at any time via customer support.
You must make a request to us for your customer account to be deleted.
To do this, contact our customer support (for example, using the contact details of your personal contacts shown on the left in your customer account).
Your personal data will only be blocked before deletion in individual cases if deletion prevents legal retention requirements or official orders.</p>
