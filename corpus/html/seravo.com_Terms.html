service is used normally, and that the Customer has tools available which

with the required rights in the typical use of the Supplier’s service.
An
example of typical use is the inspection or removal of user data stored in the
database of a WordPress website.</p> 4.
The rights of the data subjects <p>The Supplier does not handle any third-party GDPR or data protection related
requests on behalf of the Customer.

security breach.

management have legal access to the Customer’s information.
Subcontractors
are not granted access on a level that would enable them to gain entry to
possible personal data stored by the Customer in the service.</p> 8.
Storing of data <p>During the order process, the Customer has the option to choose the desired
location for their web service and the data it contains from the Supplier’s
provided list of locations available.

indefinitely.
All data that the Customer removes themselves or the Supplier
removes after a contract ends is removed permanently.</p> 9.
Auditing <p>The Supplier will provide the Customer the necessary information for
conducting an audit when requested, and will assist in the audit to prove that
the Supplier is adhering to the decrees of this data protection appendix.</p>
<p>The Supplier does not have to provide the Customer with information that
have minor influence regarding data protection, or information that would
potentially harm the Supplier’s trade secrets or cause harm to another customer
or a third-party if it was disclosed.</p>
<p>If an audit reveals a Supplier related deficiency, the Supplier is required
to fix the deficiency without delay at their own expense.</p> 10.
Costs related to data- and information protection <p>If the data processor is required to assist the data controller in
fulfilling the GDPR legislation requirements related to security breaches,
the rights of data subjects and/or the evaluation of the effect of data
protection, the data processor is allowed to invoice a reasonable number of
working hours that were carried out at a hourly rate agreed to by both the
data controller and the data processor.
The invoicing of said hours does
require that the data controller has approved the spending of billable hours
to these purposes.</p>
