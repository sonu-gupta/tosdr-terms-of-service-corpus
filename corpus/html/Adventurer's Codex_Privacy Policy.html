These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device.
For example:</p> Advertisers and Ad Networks <p>Our ad partners and network may use cookies and use related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Adventurer’s Codex does not link to or provide your actual Adventurer’s Codex account details to these advertising partners.

Adventurer’s Codex cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers will not see Adventurer’s Codex cookies.</p> Analytics Partners <p>We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services.
As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.</p>
<p>For more information about how you may control the collection and/or use of information for advertising and analytics purposes, please see “Your Choices.”</p> Security <p>We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<p>

We may also retain certain information about you as required by law.
Deleting your account will begin the process of removing your data from the Adventurer’s Codex system.
Due to the nature of our system, fully removing all your personal data from our system can take up to 10 days, though your account will be inactive and unusable immediately after cancellation.</p>

If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies.
Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p> Third-Party Advertising and Analytics <p>Some analytics providers may provide specific opt-out mechanisms (e.g.
Google Analytics Opt-out), and we will provide, as needed, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out.
You have the ability to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes.</p> Promotional Communications <p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications.
If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of our Services.</p>
