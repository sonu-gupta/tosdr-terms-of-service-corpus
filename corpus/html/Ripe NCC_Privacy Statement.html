Introduction
<p>The RIPE NCC respects the privacy of your personal information and is committed to protecting the personal information that you provide.
This RIPE NCC Privacy Statement applies to all personal information the RIPE NCC processes, including the collecting, publication, sharing and usage of personal information.
The RIPE NCC Privacy Statement describes how the RIPE NCC processes your personal data and how you can access and make changes to your personal data.</p>
2.
Processing your personal data
<p>The main purpose for which the RIPE NCC processes personal information is to support its role as a Regional Internet Registry (RIR).
The main activity to fulfil this role is the registration and administration of Internet number resources, including the maintenance of the public RIPE Database (see 2.1).</p>
<p>Additionally, the RIPE NCC processes personal information for the purpose of performing activities for the benefit of the RIPE NCC members or for the benefit of the RIPE community (see 2.2).</p>
2.1.
Personal data in the RIPE Database
<p>The public RIPE Database shows registration details of Internet number resources.
The records may contain contact details (name, email address, phone and fax numbers and postal address) of persons responsible for the operation of networks or routers and/or for maintaining the information in the RIPE Database.</p>
<p>In some cases, the RIPE NCC provides the initial registration.
Subsequently, the personal information pertaining to a specific registration is provided and maintained by a person authorised by, or acting on behalf of, the person or entity to which the Internet number resources have been registered.
Updating is subject to an authentication and authorisation procedure (see 5).
Please note that the RIPE NCC is not responsible for data entered into the RIPE Database by third parties.
The person who enters personal data is responsible for keeping all data they maintain accurate and up-to-date, including maintaining correct contact details (see 6).</p>
<p>The RIPE NCC publishes the contact details as part of the registration details of Internet number resources to make it possible for the RIPE NCC and the Internet network community to contact the appropriate persons when it is necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>To secure the proper functioning of the Internet;</li>
<li>To prevent or redress possible misuse of the Internet;</li>
<li>To improve the quality of the data;</li>
<li>To protect the information stored in the RIPE Database;</li>
<li>To prevent any unauthorised modification of information stored in the RIPE Database;</li>
<li>To ensure accountability for information entered into the RIPE Database.</li>
</ul>
<p>The RIPE Database may also be mirrored to databases operated by other RIRs, excluding database objects that are meant to include personal information.
The databases of other RIRs may also be mirrored to databases operated by the RIPE NCC.
This system allows users to retrieve data on all Internet resource registrations worldwide from the RIR in their region<br>
<br> The RIPE NCC also, for the purposes specified above, allows proxy access to the RIPE Database via third parties.
In addition, third parties may use a Near Real Time Mirror (NRTM) of the RIPE Database or access its contents in bulk via nightly dump and split files that are published by the RIPE NCC.
In both cases, database objects that are meant to include personal information are excluded.</p>
<p>Where necessary for the above purposes, and to comply with statutory obligations, the RIPE NCC may also keep historical data (data that was published in the RIPE Database before the record was updated) and RIPE Database update requests.</p>
2.2.
Processing your personal data for other purposes
<p>In addition to the collection and use of personal data in relation to the RIPE Database, the RIPE NCC provides other services and activities that may require the processing of your personal information.
These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>RIPE&nbsp;NCC member services: the RIPE NCC may request contact details for services such as relationship management, accounting and billing;</li>
<li>LIR&nbsp;Portal and the RIPE NCC website (www.ripe.net): processing of messages, service requests and information requests;</li>
<li>RIPE community and RIPE NCC membership mailing lists: messages including name, email address, date and message content are published in the mailing lists and mailing list archives to support the open and transparent RIPE Policy Development Process and discussions of membership-related issues;</li>
<li>Event registration administration for meetings, training courses and other organised events: the RIPE NCC may publish lists of attendees on a website as part of its commitment to open and transparent policy development.
These lists contain the name of the attendee and their organisation, but no contact details or other personal details.</li>
<li>Publicly-available services as defined in the RIPE NCC Website and Publicly Available Services Terms of Service: the RIPE NCC may request contact details for purposes related to the provision and proper function of these services such as information requests, installation, support, maintenance, billing, relationship management and administration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The RIPE NCC may use contact details provided in relation to all of the above activities to send you relevant information on its activities and services, such as announcements on network upgrades, outages, RIPE NCC services, RIPE Meetings, training courses and other organised events.
The RIPE NCC may also forward public messages to a particular mailing list on occasion if it is relevant and appropriate for that list.
If you do not wish to receive such messages, you can unsubscribe yourself at any time (see 5).</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the RIPE NCC may register, process or transfer your personal data where such is required pursuant to a statutory duty.</p>
2.3.
Sharing your personal data with third parties
<p>The RIPE NCC may engage third parties for the provision of RIPE NCC services.
In such cases, personal data collected for that particular purpose may be shared with these parties.</p>
<p>The RIPE NCC undertakes to engage parties that offer equivalent levels of security and protection and to make any appropriate contractual and organisational arrangements so that the data shared is limited to that required for the respective purpose and is not processed for longer than necessary.</p>
<p>If for the provision of the third-party services, &nbsp;personal data is transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area, this will happen in accordance with the Dutch and EU data protection laws.</p>
3.
Protection and secrecy of your information
<p>The RIPE NCC maintains strict procedures to authenticate people's identity and verify their right to authorise changes to their personal information.</p>
<p>Personal data held in the RIPE Database is available to the public.
Use of the RIPE Database is subject to the RIPE Database Terms and Conditions.&nbsp;The RIPE NCC operates a technical query-limiting process as well as an Acceptable Use Policy&nbsp;to prevent data mining of large amounts of personal data through the RIPE Database query service.
People attempting to abuse this service will have their access to the RIPE Database blocked.</p>
<p>The RIPE NCC maintains a high level of physical security and protection for all of its computer and network facilities, especially those in which personal information may be stored.</p>
