</ul>Master Services Agreement<p>Effective as of:&nbsp.
February 1, 2021</p>
<p>This Master Services Agreement (“<b>MSA</b>”) is incorporated into the Order Form executed between the subscribing entity (“<b>Subscriber</b>”) and the A Cloud Guru entity executing the Order Form (Serverless Heroes, Inc., A Cloud Guru, Ltd., or Linux Academy, Inc.) (each and collectively, “<b>ACG</b>”).&nbsp.
The MSA sets forth the terms and conditions that govern the provision, access, and use of all services, products, and platforms offered by ACG (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”) and, along with Subscriber’s Order Form, forms this Agreement (the “<b>Agreement</b>”) between Subscriber and ACG.</p>
<p>THIS MSA APPLIES TO BUSINESS SUBSCRIBERS ONLY.&nbsp.
For any individual subscribing to the Services for personal use, ACG’s Terms of Use apply instead.</p>
<p>
<b>1.&nbsp.
ORDER DETAILS</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>1.1.&nbsp.
Order Forms.</b>&nbsp.
Subscriber orders a subscription to the Services by entering into an Order Form (as may be amended or modified from time to time) between Subscriber and ACG (an “<b>Order Form</b>”).&nbsp.
&nbsp;An Order Form will be one of the following: (a) a written order form or other agreement (including any exhibits thereto) entered into by Subscriber and ACG.
(b) if eligible, ACG’s acceptance of Subscriber’s completion of the online ordering process made available on the ACG platform, website, or app (the “<strong>ACG Site</strong>“) – for these purchases, Serverless Heroes, Inc.
is the ACG party to the Agreement.
or (c) if subscribing through an authorized reseller of the Services the agreement(s) for the Services entered into by Subscriber and the reseller and approved by ACG, together with any additional agreements ACG may require.</p>
<p>
<b>1.2.&nbsp.
Order Form Terms.</b>&nbsp.
Certain terms of this Agreement will be detailed in Subscriber’s Order Form.&nbsp.
The Order Form will also designate the length of the subscription term (“<b>Subscription Term</b>”).&nbsp.
If the Order Form contains terms that conflict with or are in addition to the terms of this MSA the terms of the Order Form will control.&nbsp.
Capitalized terms used in this MSA and/or the Order Form will have the same meaning within each.</p>
<p>
<b>1.3.&nbsp.
Fees.</b>&nbsp.
Subscriber’s Order Form or a corresponding invoice issued by ACG will set forth the payment terms and fees due to ACG in connection with the Services for the applicable Subscription Term (“<b>Fees</b>”).&nbsp.
If any Fees are not received when due, ACG may apply a monthly late fee of the lower of 1.5% of the outstanding balance or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, unless and until all Fees and other sums due are paid in full.</p>
<p>
<b>1.4.&nbsp.
Authorized Users.&nbsp.
</b>
</p>
<p>a.&nbsp.
Subscriber Group.&nbsp.
Subscriber’s Order Form will designate the number of Subscriber’s authorized users of the Services (“<b>Users</b>”).&nbsp.
Subscriber may designate only the following individuals as Users: employees or independent contractors of Subscriber or its affiliates who will access and use the Services by or through Subscriber and solely for the benefit of Subscriber or its affiliates.&nbsp.
Only Users permitted under this Agreement may use the Services.&nbsp.
Subscriber and its Users are collectively referred to as the “<b>Subscriber Group</b>.”</p>
<p>b.&nbsp.
User Licenses.&nbsp.
Each User corresponds to a single User license.&nbsp.
Subscriber will ensure that only one person accesses the Services per each User license.&nbsp.
If Subscriber exceeds the usage authorized by the Order Form (for example, by exceeding the number of authorized Users or exceeding the Subscription Term), then ACG reserves the right to charge and invoice Subscriber the pro-rata Fees corresponding to such overage.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp.
Adding Users.&nbsp.
Subscriber may add additional users to Subscriber’s subscription during any Subscription Term (“<b>Additional Users”</b>).&nbsp.
ACG will notify Subscriber in advance of any pro-rata additional Fees associated with the Additional Users.&nbsp.
Subscriber may be required to modify its existing Order Form or enter into a new Order Form to add Additional Users.&nbsp.
If there is a delay in executing an Order Form for Additional Users, then ACG reserves the right to, rather than extend the Subscription Term, reduce the Fees for those Additional Users on a pro-rata basis commensurate with the reduction in length of the Additional Users’ Subscription Term — this is to ensure that the expiration dates of Subscriber’s original Order Form and its Additional User Order Form are coterminous.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp.
One-Time Transfer.&nbsp.
If Subscriber purchases 10 or more licenses, Subscriber may effectuate a one-time transfer of up to 10% of its purchased licenses from their original User to a new User (for example, if Subscriber purchases 100 licenses, Subscriber may transfer up to 10 of those licenses to a new user one time each).&nbsp.
None of the licenses eligible for transfer may be transferred more than once.&nbsp.
Once a license is transferred, the User from whom the license was transferred may no longer use the Services during the Subscription Term.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp.
Account Admin.&nbsp.
Subscriber’s ACG account will be administered by an employee of Subscriber (or an affiliate) designated by Subscriber (“<b>Admin.</b>”).&nbsp.
The Admin.
will have the right to manage Subscriber’s account and its Users in accordance with this Agreement and will act as an authorized representative of Subscriber in dealings with ACG related to Subscriber’s account and use of the Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.&nbsp.
</strong>
<b>THE SERVICES</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>2.1.&nbsp.
Access and Use.</b>&nbsp.
Subject to the Subscriber Group’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, during the Subscription Term, ACG will provide and maintain the Services ordered by Subscriber, together with all content, works, and materials incorporated into the Services (the “<b>Subscription Content</b>”), for access and use by the Subscriber Group in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp.
Certain portions or features of the Services may be provided or maintained by an affiliate of ACG with ACG remaining responsible for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<b>2.2.&nbsp.
Plans.</b>&nbsp.
ACG may offer different plan options (currently a “Basic” and a “Plus” Plan), each with different prices and features, for Subscriber to choose from when ordering the Services (each a “<b>Plan</b>”).&nbsp.
The features included in each Plan are described on a designated page of ACG’s website (currently at https://acloudguru.com/pricing) or at or in connection with the point of purchase of the Services.&nbsp.
Subscriber may “upgrade” to a higher-tiered Plan (e.g.
from Basic to Plus) at any time during the Subscription Term by executing an Order Form for the upgrade.&nbsp.
Upgrades will become effective, and any additional Fees associated with an upgrade will be due, as provided for in the upgrade Order Form.&nbsp.
Subscriber may not “downgrade” to a lower-tiered Plan during its then-current Subscription Term.&nbsp.
If Subscriber downgrades at the end of its Subscription Term, Subscriber will no longer have access to any features or Subscription Content that is only available through the higher-tiered Plan.</p>
<p>
<b>2.3.&nbsp.
Feature Terms.&nbsp.
</b>Certain features of the Services may be governed by terms applicable to that specific feature (“<b>Feature Terms</b>”), which Feature Terms will supplement the terms of this MSA.&nbsp.
You agree to ACG’s Hands-on Features Terms in connection with your use of any interactive Hands-on Features such as Cloud Playground and Hands-on Labs.&nbsp.
The Hand-on Feature Terms are available at https://acloudguru.com/policies/tou-cloud-playground and are incorporated into this MSA by reference.</p>
<p>
<b>2.4.&nbsp.
Trials and Pilots.</b>&nbsp.
ACG may, at its sole discretion, offer Subscriber free or discounted trials or pilots (a “<b>Trial</b>”).&nbsp.
All Trials and Order Forms applicable thereto will be subject to this MSA and/or any other terms as ACG determines.&nbsp.
ACG may cancel or modify the terms of a free Trial at any time, without prior notice and without liability.&nbsp.
At the end of the designated Trial period Subscriber will be required to subscribe to the Services at ACG’s then-current prices in order to continue using the Services.&nbsp.
NOTWITHSTANDING THAT REDUCED OR NO FEES MAY BE PAYABLE DURING A TRIAL, THE FULL PRICE OF THE FEES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE DUE FOR THE APPLICABLE NUMBER OF TRIAL LICENSES WILL BE DEEMED “FEES PAYABLE” FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>
<b>2.5.&nbsp.
Modifying the Services.</b>&nbsp.
ACG reserves the right to modify (including changing, adding to, removing, or replacing) the Services or components thereof and/or the ACG Site, as well as their features and functionality, at any time with or without notice, provided that no such modification will materially diminish the features or functionality of the Services provided to Subscriber as of the effective date of Subscriber’s then-current Order Form.&nbsp.
Nothing in this Agreement will prevent ACG from updating or removing from time-to-time Subscription Content that ACG, at its sole discretion, deems out-dated.</p>
<p>
<b>2.6.&nbsp.
Third-Party Services.</b>&nbsp.
The Services may contain products, services, platforms, and/or Subscription Content owned by third parties and integrated into the Services (“<b>Third-Party Services</b>”).&nbsp.
Use of any Third-Party Services is subject to any terms or conditions provided to Subscriber that govern the respective Third-Party Services.</p>
<p>
<b>2.7.&nbsp.
Hosting and Technical Support.</b>&nbsp.
ACG will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available on a consistent basis, excluding any planned downtime (including for updates and maintenance).&nbsp.
While ACG expects planned downtime to be minimal, during any planned downtime, the ACG Site or Services may not be accessible.&nbsp.
ACG or its contractors will provide the Subscriber Group with reasonable technical support services as may be necessary to assist the Subscriber Group in accessing and using the Services.</p>

<b>5.5.&nbsp.
Injunctive Remedies.
</b>&nbsp;Subscriber and ACG acknowledge that a party’s breach or threatened breach of its confidentiality obligations under the Agreement may cause irreparable harm and/or injury to the non-breaching party for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy.&nbsp.
Therefore, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach of the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement, in addition to all other available remedies, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief, without the requirement of posting a bond or any other security (to the extent permitted by applicable law).</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>9.1.&nbsp.

provided however, that ACG’S indemnity obligations will not apply if and to the extent a Claim is subject to Subscriber’s indemnification obligations hereunder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>9.2.&nbsp.
Indemnification by Subscriber.</b>&nbsp.
Subscriber will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ACG and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and agents (collectively, the “<b>ACG Group</b>”), from and against any third-party Claims arising from or related to Subscriber’s: (a) breach of any of the Usage Restrictions or Feature Terms.

<p>
<b>9.3.&nbsp.
Indemnification Procedures.</b>&nbsp.
The party seeking indemnity or defense&nbsp.
(“<b>Indemnified Party</b>”) will provide written notice to the party from which indemnity is sought (“<b>Indemnifying</b>
<b>Party</b>”) of the existence of any Claim as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the Claim.
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party’s failure to give timely notice of such Claim will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations unless such failure actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.&nbsp.
At the Indemnifying Party’s sole expense, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to assume and control the defense of the Claim and the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of the Claim.&nbsp.
The Indemnifying Party will have the right to settle such Claim at its sole discretion, provided that, without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the settlement is purely monetary, does not require the Indemnified Party to make a monetary payment, and provides an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim.</p>
<p>
<b>9.4.&nbsp.
Avoiding Infringement.</b>&nbsp.
If, due to a Claim of infringement, the Services (or any portion thereof) are held by a court or adjudicator of competent jurisdiction to be, or are believed by ACG to be, infringing on the Intellectual Property Rights of a third party, ACG may, at its option and expense: (a) replace or modify the Services to be non-infringing, provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality.
(b) obtain for Subscriber a license to continue using the Services.
or (c) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate or suspend all or the affected portion of the Services and issue Subscriber a pro-rata refund of any Fees commensurate with the unused Services.</p>
