<li>You retain full ownership of your Customer Data.
&nbsp;You hereby allow AppsFlyer to collect, store, use and process Customer Data as set forth in the Agreement (including, specifically as described in the AF Service Privacy Policy).</li>
<li>AppsFlyer strictly prohibits you from using the Services to collect or otherwise enable the collection of any Restricted Data.&nbsp;You hereby warrant that you shall not configure the Codes or Services to collect any Restricted Data through the Services.
Additionally, you agree that when it is known to you or when you should reasonably be aware that End User Data may be collected from Children, you shall configure the Codes and Services appropriately to ensure compliance with applicable children data protection and privacy laws (including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) – for example, by implementing an opt out from data collection when parental consent required by law is not obtained by you.</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for the correct implementation and configuration of the Codes and Services under applicable privacy or data protection laws.
You will ensure that you have a lawful basis and/or right to collect and share such Customer Data as described in this Agreement.
Without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, you shall: (A) provide appropriate notice to End Users which at a minimum: (i) complies with any applicable law or regulation.

You acknowledge that AppsFlyer has no direct relationship or interface with End Users and that its ability to comply with certain data protection and privacy laws related to its use of Collection Technologies or End User Data is dependent on your compliance with the terms of this Section 5, including your notice and consent obligations specified in this subsection (c).
Without limiting any remedies available to AppsFlyer under this Agreement or applicable law, AppsFlyer reserves the right to suspend performance of the Services if it reasonably deems that Customer has not provided appropriate notice or obtained appropriate consent as required under this section.
You shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend AppsFlyer, at your expense, from any and all third-party claims, actions, proceedings, and suits brought against AppsFlyer or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or Affiliates, and all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by AppsFlyer or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or Affiliates, arising out of your breach of this Section 5, including your failure to provide appropriate notice or obtain appropriate consent in connection with your and/or AppsFlyer’s use and processing of data as provided under this Agreement.</li>

<li>You shall be required to pay AppsFlyer all Subscription Package fees set forth in an Order Form.&nbsp;Unless different payment terms are specified in an Order Form, any amounts due shall be payable within 10 (ten) days of AppsFlyer’s issuance of the applicable invoice.
Any Subscription Package fees unpaid by you by the due date shall thereafter bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum (or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less), during the period between the date the payment first becomes due and the date such amount is actually paid.
Without derogating from any other remedies available to AppsFlyer under this Agreement or by law, if you have any outstanding debts in connection with any Services provided by AppsFlyer under any current or past Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form) and without limiting any other rights that may be available to AppsFlyer under the Agreement, AppsFlyer shall have the right to suspend or cease performance of the Services until such debt is paid.
All amounts owed to AppsFlyer are non-cancellable and fees paid are non-refundable, except as explicitly otherwise stated in the Agreement.</li>
<li>AppsFlyer may use various billing service providers.
When using such provider’s services, you agree to be subject to, and to comply with, the terms and policies of such provider.
AppsFlyer shall not be liable and/or responsible for any acts or omissions of such billing providers.</li>
<li>All fees payable hereunder, do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT or other similar taxes or duties, including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, shall be borne and paid by you.

<li>The obligations of either party to provide indemnification under this Agreement will be contingent upon the indemnified party: (i) providing the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that the indemnified party’s failure to notify the indemnifying party will not diminish the indemnifying party’s obligations under this Section, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure).
(ii) cooperating fully with the indemnifying party (at the indemnifying party’s expense).
and (iii) allowing the indemnifying party to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that no settlement may be entered into without the consent of the indemnified party if such settlement would require any action on the part of the indemnified party other than to cease using any allegedly infringing or illegal content or services.
Subject to the foregoing, an indemnified party will at all times have the option to participate in any matter or litigation through counsel of its own selection at its own expense.</li>
