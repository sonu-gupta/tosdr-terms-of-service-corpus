        Privacy Policy<p>
<strong>Effective: September 8, 2020</strong>
</p>
<strong>Welcome</strong>
<p>Aura is a leading provider of identity, privacy and security products for consumers.
This Privacy Policy describes how we process and handle data provided to Aura
in connection with your use of our products, services, apps, and websites that
link to this policy (we refer to these collectively as our “<strong>services</strong>”).</p>
<p>Information security and privacy are at the heart of what Aura values and promotes as a
company.
As such, we think it’s important to be transparent about how we handle
your information.
That level of transparency also makes for a lengthy document,
but we’ve tried to make it more readable by organizing it into a logical
structure and by using plain language.</p>
<p>Aura offers a variety of services, and certain services may process data
differently, or in additional ways, to other services and what’s described in
this policy.
We note these differences in Product Privacy Notices&nbsp.
that are specific to such services, in product documentation, or inside products themselves at places where such information is relevant.
Please refer to these Products
Privacy Notices to better understand our privacy practices for each of the
products.</p>
<p>This policy uses the term “personal data” to refer to information that is related to
an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data
under applicable data protection law.</p>

<p>In this policy, “Aura”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the companies that comprise
Aura that are responsible for your data, which may be any of the following

<strong>Business Customers</strong>
<p>Some of Aura’s services are offered to businesses.
For those services, our customer
is a business or other organization who may authorize individual end users to
use the services that it has purchased from us.
Where an organization is our
customer, it may maintain accounts with Aura through which it and its users may
submit information (“<strong>Customer Data</strong>”).
That organization typically controls those accounts and any associated Customer Data.
In this case, Aura is generally a processor of Customer Data and the organization is the controller.</p>
<strong>1.
What information do we collect about you?</strong>
<p>This section describes the various types of information we collect from and about

This information is not collected in all situations, but only in specific
situations.
For example, our VPN products only collect a limited amount of
information.
To understand the context in which collection occurs, see Section 2
(How do we use your information?) and our Product Privacy Notices.
More information about some of the mechanisms we use to collect this information, such as cookies, is available in Section 4 (Tracking Technologies &amp.
Cookies).</p>
<strong>1.1.

password and certain other information from you.
</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Location information.</strong> Unless otherwise expressly stated, we do
not collect your location information based on your device’s GPS or other
device sensor data.
However, we may collect your approximate location by
calculating an imprecise latitude and longitude based on your IP address to
provide you with better service (e.g.
to connect you to the nearest and fastest
VPN server).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.3.
Information provided to us by third parties</strong>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Accounts.

<li>
<p>
<strong>Threat Information.

Some of this
information may contain personal data on an incidental basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Business Customers.</strong> Organizations that use our business and
enterprise products may submit personal data to facilitate account management
and invite individuals to use those products.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You generally do not have a duty to disclose personal data to us unless
you have a contractual obligation to us to do so.
However, we need to collect
and process certain information that is necessary or legally required in order
to provide the services to you or otherwise perform our contractual
relationships with you.</p>

<p>
<strong>To communicate with users and prospective
users.
</strong>We use your information to communicate with you, including by responding to your requests, and sending you information and updates about our services.

this in order to fulfill our contract with you, because you consented to the
communication, or because we have a legitimate interest in providing you with
information about our services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>To improve our services.
</strong>We want to offer you the best services and
user experiences we can, so we have a legitimate interest in continually
improving and optimizing our services.
To do so, we use your information to
understand how users interact with our services.
Examples: we analyze certain
usage, device, and diagnostic information to understand aggregated usage trends
and user engagement with our services (and, for example, invest in technical
infrastructure to better serve regions with increasing user demand).
we may use
device and threat information to conduct spam, threat, and other scientific

</strong>We may use information for security
purposes (such as to investigate security issues or to monitor and prevent
fraud) and to prevent abuse.
We may do this to comply with our legal
obligations, to protect an individual’s vital interests, or because we have a
legitimate interest in preventing harm or liability to Aura and our users.
For
example, we may use account, usage, and device information to determine if an
entity is engaging in abusive or unauthorized activity in connection with our
services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>For legal compliance.

practices regarding <i>sharing</i> your

We also use your information to enforce our legal rights and resolve
disputes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>3.
Who do we share your information with and why?</strong>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<strong>3.1.
In General</strong>
<p>
We may disclose your information in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>In accordance with your instructions or consent.</strong>
For example, some services may allow you to register an account using a third
party account (such as a Google or Microsoft account).
If you choose to do so,
we will share information with the third party account provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>To your business organization (for our
business services).</strong> If a business customer is providing you with access to our services
through a business account, others in that organization may be able to see and
manage your account and the information associated with it (such as an
administrator).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>For collaborating with others.
</strong>Some services may provide ways for
different users to interact or collaborate with each other.
Your information
will be shared in connection with those activities if you choose to engage in
them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Affiliates and third party service providers.
</strong>To
help us provide some aspects of our services, we work with trusted third
parties and partners (including affiliated companies in the Aura group).
To
protect your data, we enter into appropriate confidentiality and data
processing terms with these third parties, review their security practices, and
limit information sharing to the scope of what they are helping us with.
Examples of activities that third parties help us with include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>processing customer payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing analytics about our services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing sales and customer support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintaining the infrastructure required to provide our services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delivering our marketing and advertising content</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>For security research purposes.</strong> A sanitized subset of our threat
intelligence data may be shared with selected reputable members of the
cybersecurity industry for the purpose of security threat research and
facilitating community efforts to improve online security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>To a new owner.</strong> If ownership or control of all or part of
our services, assets, or business changes, we may transfer your information to
the new owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Aggregated or de-identified data.</strong> We may use and share aggregated data and
data that is de-identified such that it no longer reveals the identity of an
individual user for regulatory compliance, research and analysis, our own
marketing and advertising activities and other legitimate business purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>To comply with legal process and the law.</strong> We are fiercely protective of the privacy
of our users.
If you use our VPN products, we protect your privacy by ensuring
that we do not log or record online activities that you conduct over a VPN
connection in any way that can be tied back to you, meaning that we do not have
any data to share with law enforcement and government agencies who make
requests for information about what you were doing through a VPN connection.
Subject to the foregoing, we may share your information if we are required to
do so by applicable law.
to comply with our legal obligations.
to comply with
legal process.
and to respond to valid law enforcement requests relating to a
criminal investigation, or alleged or suspected illegal activity that may
expose Aura, you, or any of our other users to legal liability.
If we share
your information for these purposes, we limit the information shared to what is
legally necessary, and challenge information requests that we believe are
unlawful, overbroad, or otherwise invalid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>To enforce our rights and prevent fraud and abuse.</strong>
We may share limited amounts of your information to enforce and administer our
agreements with customers and users, and to respond to claims asserted against
Aura.
We may also share your information in order to protect against fraud and
abuse against Aura, our affiliates, users and others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>3.2.
Free Products Only</strong>
<p>
<strong>Displaying Ads.</strong> We do not display third party ads in our paid products.
With respect to our free mobile apps and other free products, we may serve ads to users in certain regions.
Although the money we make from displaying these ads offsets only part of the costs of making these apps and services available for free, we provide free apps because we believe it’s important that everyone has the opportunity, regardless of their situation, to
have secure and private access to the internet.</p>
<p>The ads we display in our services are supplied either by advertisers
or affiliate networks we have relationships with, or by Google, a third party
advertising network (“<strong>Google Ads</strong>”).
To display these ads in our apps, we may integrate into them a software development kit (SDK), which consists of software code provided by a third party, such as an ad network.</p>
<p>We do not provide Google Ads with any personal data about you, except
for an approximate city-level latitude and longitude which lets them show ads
which are more relevant for your approximate geographic location.
However,
Google Ads may collect information through their SDKs, such as your mobile
advertising identifier, IP address, and device information, for the purpose of
serving you with “personalized” ads (ads that they think are more relevant to
you) and measuring your response to those ads.
If you are using a VPN
connection, your IP address is hidden from ad networks and replaced with the IP
address of our VPN servers.
Because we do not provide ad networks with personal
data about you (apart from city-level location), Google Ads personalizes ads
based on information that they collect from you and that they already have
about you - not based on information we share with them.</p>
<p>Google collects this information according to the Google advertising privacy notice.
Where an AdChoices logo appears on an ad,
you can click it to learn more about the ad network that provided the ad, its
privacy policy, and your choices regarding opting out from any personalized
advertising.
If you opt out from personalized advertising, you may still see
non-personalized ads.</p>
<p>While we request you not to use ad blockers to prevent the display of
ads because that is how we support our free services, our services are able to
continue functioning if you do use ad blockers.</p>

Tracking Technologies &amp.
Cookies</strong>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<strong>4.1.
About Tracking Technologies</strong>
<p>Aura uses various technologies in our services to help us collect
information, primarily on our websites and in our marketing emails.
For
convenience, we refer to these as “tracking technologies,” although they are
not always used to track individuals and the information collected is in a
non-identifiable form that does not reference any personal data.
Tracking
technologies include:</p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
<p>Cookies are small portions of text that are stored on the device you
use to access our services.
Cookies enable us (or third parties that we allow
to set cookies on your device) to recognize repeat users.
Cookies may expire
after a period of time, depending on what they are used for.</p>
<strong>Pixel Tags / Page Tags / Web Beacons / Tracking Links</strong>
<p>These are small, hidden images and blocks of code placed in web pages,
ads, and our emails that allow us to determine if you perform a specific
action.
When you access a page, ad, or email, or click a link, these items let us
know that you have accessed that page, opened an email, or clicked a link.</p>
<p>
<strong>SDKs</strong>
</p>
<p>SDKs or software development kits are software code provided by our
business partners that let our software interact with the services those
partners provide.
For example, in our free mobile apps, we may use an SDK to
enable our app to serve ads from an advertising network.
Sometimes these
interactions will involve that business partner collecting some information
from the device on which the software is run.</p>
<strong>4.2.
Why we use Tracking Technologies</strong>
<p>We use tracking technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>To provide our services.</strong> Some cookies are essential for the proper

<strong>To store your preferences.</strong> Cookies can store your preferences, such
as language preferences or whether to pre-fill your username on sign in forms.
We may also use them to optimize the content that we show to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>For analytics.</strong> Cookies are used to inform us how users
interact with our services so we can, as a legitimate interest, improve how
they work (such as what screens or webpages you access, and whether our
advertising is effective).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>For security.</strong> Cookies can enable us and our payment
processors to detect certain kinds of fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>For advertising-related purposes.
</strong>We advertise our services online with the
help of third parties who show ads and marketing about us on sites around the
internet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>4.3.

services.
These partners use these technologies for the following purposes:</p>

<strong>For Analytics.</strong> To help us understand how you use our
services.</p>
</li>
<li>

retargeting (serving ads based on your past interactions with our services),
and target ads at similar audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>To Serve Ads.</strong> This is relevant to users of our free
products only.
Ad networks and affiliate networks may use these technologies to
display ads which they think will be more relevant to you.

Security</strong>
<p>Securing personal data is an important aspect of protecting privacy.
Aura employs a
range of administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards
designed to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or
modification.
We endeavor to use reasonably available state-of-the-art network
and information security standards, protocols and technologies, including
encryption, intrusion detection and data loss prevention, and we monitor our
systems to ensure that they comply with our security policies.</p>
<p>We implement rigorous physical, technical and organizational safeguards to protect
your personal data in our custody, both at rest and in transit, and should
these measures fail to prevent a data breach, we will promptly take the
necessary remedial measures, and we will notify you as well as applicable
regulators of any such breach, as required by applicable law.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security of your personal data or the security
of our products, or wish to report a potential security issue, please contact
security@aura.com.
When reporting a potential security issue, please describe

International Data Transfers</strong>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<strong>6.1.
Transfers to Other Countries</strong>
<p>Aura may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one in which you
reside.
We do this to facilitate our operations, and transferees include other
Aura group companies, service providers, and partners.
Laws in other countries
may be different to those that apply where you reside.
For example, personal
data collected within Switzerland or the European Economic Area (EEA) may be
transferred and processed outside Switzerland or the EEA for purposes described
in this policy.
However, we put in place appropriate safeguards that help to
ensure that such data receives an adequate level of protection.
These include
implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for
transfers of personal information between us and our business affiliates and
associates to which we choose to transfer the information that requires these
companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in
accordance with European Union data protection law.&nbsp.
You may contact us if you would like more information about such safeguards.
We implement similar appropriate safeguards
with our third-party service providers and further details can be provided upon
request.</p>
<p>If you change your country of residence, the Aura group company responsible for
your data may change accordingly, and your data may be transferred to that
other company.</p>
<strong>6.2.
Privacy Shield</strong>
<p>One of our subsidiaries, Pango Inc.
has certified its compliance to the U.S.
Department of Commerce with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework

third parties process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the
Privacy Shield Principles, except where we can establish that Aura was not
responsible for the violation.</p>
