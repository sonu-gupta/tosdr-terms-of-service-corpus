<li>If you elect to purchase a subscription to use a paid version of our Service, we may receive information about your purchase from our third-party payment processor.</li>

</ul>Information Sharing<ul>
<li>Workona may share your personal information with third parties in the following limited circumstances:<ul>
<li>When we have your consent.</li>
<li>With third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are working on our behalf, who are hosting our data, and need access to your information to carry out their work for us.

<li>With your employer if the domain of the primary email address associated with your Workona account is owned by your employer and that email address was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and an authorized representative of that organization wishes to establish a Workona company account and add you to it, then certain information concerning your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator including your name and email address, and your account may be added to the corporate account.</li>

</ul>Browser Do Not Track<ul>
<li>Some browsers offer a “do not track” (“DNT”) option.
Because no common industry or legal standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators, we do not respond to DNT signals.
