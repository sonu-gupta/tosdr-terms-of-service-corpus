They produce vibrant prints with accurate colour densities and dark blacks—and their page yields are as good as the genuines, if not better</p>
<p>Any items damaged in transit should be reported to us within three working days.</p>
Printer Protection Guarantee
<p>In the unlikely event that Cartridge Save own brand cartridges cause damage to your printer—regardless of how old your printer is—we will repair or replace your printer for free.</p>

One year returns on unopened printer cartridges
<p>Provided that the products are unopened, and in brand-new condition, you can send anything back to us for a refund for up to one year after making the purchase.</p>
