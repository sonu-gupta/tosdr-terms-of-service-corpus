Full ResearchGate contact information is available here.ResearchGate’s mission is to connect the world of science and make research open to all.
Connections can only be established when potential connections and commonalities are known and connecting lines can be drawn.
Openness can only be achieved with comprehensive accessibility.

We also gather information from external sources, in order to disseminate as much relevant scientific content as possible to drive science forward.
Any natural or legal person who, as a recipient of the Service, accesses or uses the Service for any purpose is a User ("<strong>User</strong>", "<strong>you</strong>").
Our registered Users ("<strong>Members</strong>") can, by way of example, and not as a limitation, share their professional identities, credentials, awarded grants, display their academic publications, engage and collaborate with their networks, exchange knowledge and professional insights, contact or be contacted by other Users (including recruiters), post and view relevant content, and discover business and career opportunities.
Some content is also visible to unregistered and logged-out Users ("<strong>Visitors</strong>").2.

In some jurisdictions, you may be bound to these Terms if you access the Service.
Furthermore, a Visitor may also be asked to assent to these Terms in order to use a certain limited number of features on the Service.
The Terms become binding on Members once we accept your offer to enter into a binding agreement with us, e.g., once you have submitted the registration process and we have sent confirmation that you have successfully registered for the Service.The Service is only available to individuals who are at least 18 years old.
If you are under 18, you may not use or attempt to register for the Service.

If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern.
