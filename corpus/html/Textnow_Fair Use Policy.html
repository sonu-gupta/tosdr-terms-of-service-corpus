         Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy About the Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy <p>The Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy has been put in place to ensure we can always offer all of our customers unlimited 2G data at affordable prices.</p>
<p>The Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy is designed such that with normal usage, it will be impossible to come close to violating it.</p>
<p>The Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy is designed to prevent the very small percentage of customers who use an abnormally high amount of data while using unlimited 2G data from affecting the continuity of our affordable unlimited 2G data plans for all customers.</p> Our Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy <p>TextNow Wireless reserves the right to suspend unlimited 2G data service for customers who use an abnormally high amount of unlimited 2G data.</p>
<p>Abnormally high amount of data is defined as:</p>
<p>Using over 170MB of data per day while using unlimited 2G data (after exceeding plan’s 3G/4G data allowance), for 3 or more consecutive days OR using more than 1GB of data in a 5 day period while using unlimited 2G data OR using unlimited 2G data as a substitute for home Internet</p>
<p>If you have been suspended under this policy, an email will be sent from a TextNow representative with suggestions to take corrective action such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecting the phone to home WiFi</li>
<li>Minimizing the streaming of video and audio without WiFi</li>
<li>Restricting background data usage of various apps in your phone’s Settings menu</li>
</ul>
<p>Once corrective action is taken, unlimited 2G data service may be unsuspended.</p>
<p>TextNow Wireless reserves the right to update this policy in the future as required.</p>
