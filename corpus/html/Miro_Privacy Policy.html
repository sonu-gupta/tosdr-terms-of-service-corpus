dba Miro (“<strong>Miro</strong>” and also referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;“<strong>our</strong>”,&nbsp;“<strong>us</strong>” and “<strong>we</strong>”) understands the importance of user privacy and takes privacy matters very seriously.
By visiting Miro’s existing and future website(s), application(s) and/or domain name(s) at https://miro.com, including its sub-domains and mobile optimized version (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”), or otherwise accessing any linked pages, features, content, products, services, mobile properties and mobile device applications for iPhone, iPad, Android or other smartphone or tablet device (each, a "<strong>Service</strong>") owned or operated by Miro, you acknowledge and accept the terms in this Privacy Policy (“<strong>Policy</strong>”).
This Policy is a legally binding agreement between Miro and, you, a user of our Services and/or visitor of our Site.
and your acceptance of this Policy arises upon your simple use of the Services, your use of the Site, or when you otherwise click on the “I accept” checkbox on our registration page (or similar box or means).
If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please close this web tab and immediately stop browsing our Site and/or using the Services.
A separate agreement and/or terms and conditions governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the “<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>”), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts.
This Policy shall be incorporated by reference into the Customer Agreement.
The organization (e.g., your employer or other entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (“<strong>Customer</strong>”) controls the terms governing the Services and any associated Customer Data.
If you have any questions about specific settings and privacy practices, please contact the administrator for your Miro account.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”), or any other third party products, services or businesses.
This Privacy Policy describes the following information about collected by Miro:</p>Information We Collect<p>We collect a variety of personally identifiable information ("PII") about users of our Services in order to ensure a quality user experience.
"PII" means information that we can use to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address or other contact information.
You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all PII that you submit to us.
Inaccurate information may affect your experience when using the Services and/or our ability to contact you as described in this Policy.
PII collected by us is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law.
PII does not include "Aggregated Information" which is information or data we collect where individual user identities have been removed, including metadata on your use of the Services, IP address logs, device and location information.
Aggregated Information helps us understand trends, user needs and other information to provide improved Services and may be used by us for any purpose.
We may also collect other non-personally identifiable information about your use and interaction with our Services.
"Non-personally identifiable information" means information where we cannot determine the identity of a natural person.
Non-personally identifiable information is not treated as PII unless we combine it with or link it to PII that you give to us.
If you do not wish to disclose any required information, then your sole remedies shall be to close this web tab, delete your Miro account and/or exit the Site.</p>How We Collect Information
<strong>Information You Give Us</strong>
<p>We collect information that you give to us when you register or use our Services.
When you register for a Miro user account ("<strong>Account</strong>") on the website or mobile application, you will be assigned a unique account identifier which will be associated with any information you give to us under your Account.
You may also give us information to allow us to contact you or use certain features available through our Services without signing up for an Account, such as when you fill out a request form, provide feedback, email us, or engage in communications with our team.
While you may use some functionality of the Services and/or Site without registering for an Account, most functionality and services will require that you register for an Account.</p>Customer Support Information<p>Your emails, calls and other correspondence to and from us may be recorded for various purposes including: monitoring customer service quality or compliance, checking accuracy of the information you provide us, preventing fraud or providing training for our staff or customer service representatives.
Any information obtained from you through Customer support will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.</p>
<strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong>
<p>Even if you do not provide information to us, we automatically collect certain information about your use and interaction with our Site and/or Services.
For example, when you visit our website, our systems automatically maintain web logs to record data about all visitors who use our website and stores this information in our database.
These web logs may contain information about you including the following: IP address, type(s) of operating system you use, type of device you use, date and time you visited the website, your activity and/or referring websites.
We use your log information to troubleshoot problems, gather demographic information, customize your experience when accessing our Site, Services and other business purposes.</p>Information Collected From Other Sources<p>We may receive information about you from outside sources, such as commercially available demographic or marketing information, and add or combine it with your information to provide better service to you and inform you of Services or other information that may be of interest to you.
Our Site offers you the functionality of using your social media credentials (e.g.
Facebook, Google, Miro, etc.) to use single-sign-on to enter our Site, and in that manner, we may also collect certain information from you as you log on.
We will not collect more information from you when using your social media credentials beyond the information such third parties disclose to us.</p>How We Use Information<p>In&nbsp;order for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;provide and maintain our Site and Services, and to&nbsp;improve your user experience, we&nbsp;will use your information in accordance with your instructions, including any applicable terms in your Customer Agreement and applicable law.

</li>
<li>
<p>As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.</p>
</li>
</ul>With Whom We Share Information<strong>Disclosure With Your Consent</strong>
<p>Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of information, and Miro does not control how a Customer or any other third parties choose to share or disclose information.

<ul>
<li>
<p>In writing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbally;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online, by clicking on a link or button;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other mechanism.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Services permit you to submit information which may be displayed to other authorized users in the same or different Customer Account.
The sharing and other controls applied to such information may be determined by you, other users and/or an administrator of your Account.</p>
<p>We may share your information with third parties as necessary to provide Services to you or to support the technical operation and/or maintenance of our Services, including third party application that you may engage within the Services.
We may also share information with our affiliates, agents, outside vendors or service providers to perform functions on our behalf.
When a third party acts solely on our behalf and otherwise as applicable, we use reasonable commercial efforts to require that party to follow the privacy practices stated in this Policy or have complementary privacy protections to protect your information.
We do not share your information with unaffiliated third parties except as permitted to do so in this Policy.</p>
<strong>Disclosure Without Your Consent</strong>
<p>In general, we may disclose your information without your consent to disclosure when we reasonably believe disclosure is appropriate in order to:</p>

<p>Comply with the law (e.g., lawful subpoena or court order);</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In connection with a merger, acquisition, public offering, sale of company assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, subject to standard confidentiality requirements.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Use or disclose aggregated or de-identified data in our sole discretion.</p>
</li>
</ul>How We Protect Information<p>We use industry standard protocols and technology to protect your registered user information and personal data in order to guard and encrypt data for transmission in a format that prevents data theft by unauthorized third parties, including internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, security measures, and physical security measures.

We also urge you to take additional steps on your own to safeguard and maintain the integrity of your information.
For example, you should never share your Account or login information with other people and be sure to sign off when finished using a shared or public computer.
We urge you to be aware that if you use or access our Services through a third party computer network (e.g., internet café, library) or other potentially non-secure internet connection, such use is not recommended and is solely at your own risk.
It is your responsibility to check beforehand on the privacy and/or security policy of your network prior to accessing the Services.
We are not responsible for your handling, sharing, re-sharing and/or distribution of your information except as set forth in the Policy.</p>What Choices Do You Have<strong>Control of&nbsp;your information</strong>
