        What are cookies? <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
The term “<b>cookie</b>” is used in this Cookie Statement in the broad sense to include cookies and all similar techniques and technologies, including web beacons.&nbsp.
Web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Online Properties or taken an action in relation to our Online Properties.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Eventbrite) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).
The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

&nbsp.
Why do we use cookies? <p>Eventbrite uses first- and third-party cookies for several reasons.
Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Online Properties to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
Other cookies enable us to better understand your use of our Online Properties, to track and target the interests of our Users, and to enhance the experience of Users on our Online Properties.
Third parties serve cookies through our Online Properties for advertising, analytics and other purposes.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizers can also use cookies on our Online Property to learn more about your interests in their event(s).
These practices are described in more detail below.</p>
&nbsp.

<b>Third-party cookies</b>
</p>
&nbsp.
<p>In addition to the first-party cookies we use, some third-party companies may place cookies on your computer through our Online Properties, access those cookies, and associate web beacons with them.
