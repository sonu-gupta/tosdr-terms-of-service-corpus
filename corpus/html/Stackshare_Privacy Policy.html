Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.</p>
<li>Contractual Necessity: We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services.
When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.</li>
<li>Consent: In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data.
When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.</li>
<li>Other Processing Grounds: From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.</li>
How and With Whom Do We Share Your Data?
<p>We share Personal Data with vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.
These parties include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics service providers</li>
<li>Staff augmentation and contract personnel</li>
<li>Hosting service providers</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of the providers we utilize to operate our service, and thus have the potential to process customer data, please see section “List of Subprocessors” below.</p>

<p>We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you Services.
In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation.
Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.
For example, if you verified your company’s stack profile, but delete your personal user account and user profile, the company stack profile you created will not automatically be deleted, unless you manually delete it.</p>
What Security Measures Do We Use?
<p>We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity.
For example, we use two-factor authentication for many services we use internally and have begun to use a central password management solution.</p>
Personal Data of Children
<p>
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16.
If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us.
If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at
privacy@stackshare.io.
