We respect and abide by U.S.

<br>
<p>PrivateInternetAccess.com implements an automated virtual private network (“VPN”) service.
Our service is fully automated and we do not log our user’s activities.
We do not in any way select the recipients our users transmit to or the material our users access while using our service.

<br>
<p>As a result, PrivateInternetAccess.com’s VPN service qualifies as a provider of transitory digital network communications under 17 U.S.C.
§ 512(a) of the Copyright Act.
As we do not store any content accessed by our users, we are unable to delete any such content that may be infringing.
Because we do not log our users’ activities in order to protect and respect their privacy, we are unable to identify particular users that may be infringing the lawful copyrights of others.</p>
