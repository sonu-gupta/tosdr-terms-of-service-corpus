If any provision of the TOS (or part of such provision) is found to be invalid or unenforceable by any court having competent jurisdiction, then that provision (or part of that provision) shall be deemed severable from the TOS and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions — that invalid or unenforceable (part of the) clause will be replaced by a valid and/or enforceable, as the case may be, (part of the) clause which is as close to the original intention of the parties as possible.
The failure of Taboola to insist upon or enforce any of the provisions of these TOS, or to exercise any rights or remedies under these TOS, will not be construed as a waiver of Taboola’s right to assert or rely upon any such provisions, rights, or remedies in that or any other instance.
rather, the same will be and remain in full force and effect.
No waiver of any term of these TOS shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.
