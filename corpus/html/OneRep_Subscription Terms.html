Your annual subscription will be automatically renewed at the beginning of each subsequent anniversary year unless you give prior written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the current year subscription.</p> Trial Period <p>We provide free access to the Services during the 5-days trial period starting from the moment that you activate such trial period by submitting your payment details (the “Free Trial Period”).
If you decide that you do not want to become a paying user of the Services upon the lapse of the Free Trial Period, you have to terminate your Services by the end of the Free Trial Period, otherwise you will become a paying user of the Services according to the subscription plan you have chosen.</p>
