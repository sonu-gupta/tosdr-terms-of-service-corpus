Seller agrees to permit and hereby authorize Alibaba.com, which in turn instructs Alibaba.com to deduct, withhold and dispose any deposits provided in accordance with the terms under the relevant buyer protection plan.
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the protection afforded to you under a buyer protection plan applies to those Online Transactions where the Seller subscribed to such plan and the purchase falls within the buyer protection plan’s scope.&nbsp.
Services described under clause 3.3 of this Agreement will not be applicable to you if Seller subscribed to the buyer protection plan and such plan already covers your purchase.</p>

Due to currency fluctuations, such amount refunded may be less than the amount paid by the Buyer in the Online Transaction, and Alibaba.com shall not be liable to any party for any difference in the amount refunded attributable to currency conversion costs or exchange rate movements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.7&nbsp;&nbsp.
Unclaimed funds will be held by Alibaba.com for a period of five years as instructed by Alibaba.com, at which time, the Seller will be deemed to have waived any claim in respect of such funds or, if required by applicable escheat laws, we will remit the funds (less any fees, if any and to the extent permitted under applicable laws) to the relevant competent authority.&nbsp.
You hereby agree that upon expiry of such period or upon remittance of such funds to the relevant competent authority in accordance to the applicable escheat laws, Alibaba.com will be relieved of any further obligation to pay those unclaimed funds to you.</p>
