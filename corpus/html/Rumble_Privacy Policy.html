<p>Rumble.com is operated by Rumble Inc.
In this Policy, we will refer to Rumble Inc.
or Rumble.com as "Rumble", "our", "us" or "we".</p>
<p>We take your privacy seriously.
We are providing this Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information on our Service.
We also want to inform you about your choices regarding information.
If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know (see "How to contact us" section below).</p>
<p>Note that this Policy may be modified from time to time in our sole discretion, so check back frequently.</p> 1.
How we collect information <p>We collect information in three basic ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We collect information that you voluntarily provide to become a registered User of our Service, and when you use certain aspects of our Service (e.g., entering an email address on a form to send an email from your Rumble account).
</li>
<li>We collect information when you register to join Rumble by logging into an account that you already have with certain third-party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Service.
For example, our Service allows you to create an account and login to the Service using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect.
If you are not currently registered as a User on the Service and you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join Rumble.
</li>
<li>When you browse or use our Service, technological tools including "Log Data" and "Cookies" collect certain information, as explained in the following section.
</li>
</ol> 2.
What information we collect and how we use it <ol>
<li>
<strong>Personal Information.</strong> When you register with us through the Service to become a registered User of Rumble, we will ask you for certain information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information").
Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, gender, profile photo, free-form biography, location/hometown, website and email address.
If you decide to create your User account by logging into a SNS via the Service, you are using the Personal Information you have already provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your User account on our Service.
the information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the SNS's privacy and data practices.
For example, by using Facebook Connect, you are allowing Rumble to access the Personal Information in your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the Service via Facebook.
We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your "Non-Identifying Information," see below) to provide the Service to you.
For example: <ol>
<li>
<strong>Account registration.</strong> We create your User account for your use of the Service based upon the Personal Information you provide.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Communications.</strong> We use your Personal Information to contact you with Rumble newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "preferences" information in your account settings.
(See "Your choices regarding information," below.) </li>
<li>
<strong>Customer service.</strong> We use your Personal Information to respond to your questions and/or inquiries.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Finding friends.</strong> You also have the option to import your personal contacts (including email addresses of friend lists via SNS) to the Service so that you can find your friends on the Service, and your friends can find you on the Service.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Emailing via a Rumble Account.</strong> As part of the Service, Rumble Users may communicate with other registered and non-registered Users through use of their Rumble accounts.
Where Users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Rumble to those email addresses on their behalf.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Non-Identifying Information.</strong> We also collect other information that you provide as part of registration, the operation, and personalization of your boards on Rumble that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you (e.g., without limitation, age and individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information").
Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be personally identified or contacted.
But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (for example, your viewing preferences) We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Rumble Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Service is used.
We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile Software.</strong> Our Mobile Software allows Users to access and use the Service from their mobile devices.
From the Mobile Software, in the event that our Mobile Software crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model, software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Mobile Software.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Log Data.</strong> When you visit the Service, whether as a registered User or a non-registered User just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data").
This Log Data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Service, pages of our Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Service, access times and dates, and other statistics.
We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and the Service's technical administration, to increase our Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Service to our visitors' needs.
For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Service again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.
We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many online services, Rumble uses "cookies" on our Service to collect information.

Second, we utilize "session ID" cookies to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Rumble Users and web traffic routing on the Service.
Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Service and then close your browser.a You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the Service.
