<li>Creators will be entitled to set reference prices for the Sale Proceeds for Request Rewards (“Reference Prices”).
Creators shall be entitled to determine Reference Prices as they see fit, within a price range designated by the Company.</li>
<li>Fans (excluding Co-requesting Fans) shall be entitled to set Sale Prices as they see fit within the price range designated by the Company, and the price set by a Fan (“Set Price”) shall be the Sale Proceeds of the relevant Request Agreement formed in accordance with Article 5.</li>
<li>The Set Price as stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be the Sale Proceeds for any Users Co-requesting on a given Request Agreement.</li>
</ol>Article 5: Formation of Request Agreements<ol>
<li>Fans will be entitled to transmit Requests to Creators by Company-prescribed method.
When transmitting Requests, Fans will be obligated to pay Creators an advance for compensation payment arising when the relevant Request Agreements have been formed pursuant to such Requests subject to the condition that the advance will be refunded if the Request Agreements have not been formed, and the Company will confirm that such Fans have capacity to make payments equivalent to the Sale Proceeds by collecting a credit using a prescribed payment settlement method.
When a Creator has Accepted a Request from a Fan by Company-prescribed method as specified in the preceding paragraph, a Request Agreement shall be formed as a two-party agreement between the Creator and the Fan stipulating that the Creator will provide the relevant Request Reward within the extent of the Plan set by such Creator, and that the Fan will pay the Sale Proceeds as consideration for such provision.
The Company shall, on behalf of the Creator, receive the Sale Proceeds paid by the Fan.
Creators will be entitled to determine the content of Request Rewards at their discretion, as long as such determinations are within the extent of the Plans set by such Creators in applicable Request Agreements.</li>
<li>Fans other than the Fans that are parties of completed Request Agreements can also make Requests in respect of the Plans of such completed Request Agreements, by Co-requesting.

<li>The total Sale Proceeds for the completed Request Agreement are no more than one million yen.

<li>If a Request Agreement has been formed, the relevant Fan will not be entitled to demand refunds of any Sale Proceeds already paid, except where explicitly specified otherwise.
Sale Proceeds are not eligible for cooling off and cannot be refunded pursuant thereto.<ul>
<li>*Cooling off is a system enabling unconditional withdrawal of agreement applications or termination of agreements, for a certain period after application for or execution of an agreement.
However, online sales are outside the scope of such systems, and cooling off systems thus cannot be used for Request Agreements as in Paragraph 1 of this article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Fan will not be entitled to Cancel or refund any already-paid Sale Proceeds for reason of the particulars of the Request Reward provided by a Creator.
provided, however, that if the Creator has not provided the Request Reward in accordance with the relevant Plan, or if there is noncompliance with the agreement in formal terms (e.g., if there is an error in the file format provided by the Creator, if the Fan cannot download the Reward), the Fan shall be entitled to contact the Company about such matter using the “Inquiry Form” on the Site.
If the Company has considered such communication from the Fan and determined that the Fan’s claims are reasonable, the Company will be entitled, but not obligated, to instruct the Creator to make corrections, refund the Sale Proceeds, or take other such action.
In such case, the Fan and the Creator shall act in accordance with the Company’s instructions, and except where explicitly specified otherwise, the Company will bear no liability for any damage etc.
arising due to any decision or action by the Company.</li>
<li>Creators shall comply with the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations, the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions, and other related laws and regulations.
In addition, where required under the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions, subject Creators shall make appropriate notations on the Site as required under the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions.<ul>
<li>To determine whether a notation under the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions is required, please refer to the “Guidelines related to ‘Sellers’ in Internet Auctions” on the website of the Consumer Affairs Agency, and other such resources.https://www.no-trouble.caa.go.jp/what/mailorder/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creators shall have fully performed their obligations to provide Request Rewards when they provide such Request Rewards to Fans in accordance with Request Agreements.
The acceptance of new Co-requesting shall also terminate at such time.
Payment to Creators of Sale Proceeds that the Company has received from Fans on behalf of Creators shall be as specified in Article 8.</li>
</ol>Article 7: Deletion or Termination of Requests<ol>
<li>A Fan will be entitled to rescind the transmission of Requests by Company-prescribed procedures if the relevant Creator has not yet Accepted such Request.</li>
<li>A Request will be retracted automatically if seven days have passed from the date of transmission of such Request without the relevant Creator Accepting such Request.
All Sale Proceeds advances received by the Company will be refunded to the relevant Fan.</li>
<li>If, after the formation of a Request Agreement, 60 days have passed from the date of transmission of a Request without the relevant Creator providing the Request Reward to the Fan, such Request Agreement will be deemed terminated, and all Sale Proceeds received by the Company will be refunded to such Fan.</li>
<li>The following items shall apply in the case where a Creator account has been deleted.<ol>
<li>If account deletion occurred before the formation of a Request Agreement (before Request Acceptance), the Plan set by the relevant Creator will be deemed to have been retracted, and will be deleted.</li>
<li>If account deletion occurred after the formation of a Request Agreement (after Request Acceptance) but before full provision of the Request Reward, all Sale Proceeds paid shall be refunded to the relevant Fan.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The following items shall apply in the case where a Fan account has been deleted.<ol>
<li>If account deletion occurred before the formation of a Request Agreement (before Request Acceptance), the Fan will be deemed to have retracted the relevant Request.</li>
<li>If account deletion occurred after the formation of a Request Agreement (after Request Acceptance) but before full provision of the Request Reward, the Fan is deemed to have waived the right to receive the Request Reward under such Request Agreement.
No Sale Proceeds will be refunded to the Fan in such case.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Company will be entitled to terminate Request Agreements before full provision of the relevant Request Rewards if it determines that a prohibited act as set forth in Article 13 has been committed.
All Sale Proceeds received by the Company in connection with such Request Agreements will be refunded to the Fans of such Request Agreements.</li>

<li>Creators shall entrust in advance to the Company the proxy receipt of Sale Proceeds paid by Fans to Creators.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>The amount remitted for a single Remittance Request shall not exceed 1,000,000 yen.</li>
<li>If, in the case where a Sale Proceeds balance is less than 5,000 yen, the relevant Creator has not made a Remittance Request by the last day of the month preceding the month marking the passage of 180 days from the Request transmission date (if there is Co-requesting, then the date of transmission of the original Request), the Company shall pay such balance to a bank account designated in advance by such Creator.
Cases of flawed account information etc.
shall be handled in accordance with the terms of Article 9.</li>
<li>No interest shall accrue for the period from receipt of Sale Proceeds by the Company or a third party designated by the Company until payment by the Company to the relevant Creator.</li>
<li>When the setting for the Automatic Payment is valid, or when a Creator has made a Remittance Request, the Company shall remit the Received Amount as of the last day of the preceding month within five business days of the 20th of the month immediately following the month in which the balance of the Received Amount subject to the Automatic Payment existed or in which the Remittance Request was made (“Remittance Period”);</li>
<li>Received Amounts shall include consumption tax equivalents for the prices of any Request Rewards sold.</li>
<li>When a payment date falls on a non-work day of the Company or a relevant financial institution, the Company shall make remittance within five business days of the business day immediately following such payment date.</li>
<li>When due to a Company system failure or other such cause there has been overpayment to a Creator of an amount for remittance, the Creator will be obligated to immediately return the amount of such overpayment to the Company regardless of reason.</li>
<li>In the case where doubts have arisen as to Creator’s rights etc.
related to a Request Reward, or where it is determined that a problem arising between a Creator and a Fan as a result of an inquiry from a User or the like has not been resolved after a certain period, the Company shall be entitled, at its discretion, to halt any remittance of Received Amounts over which such Creator holds rights.
Creators shall consent to the foregoing.</li>
<li>When a Creator has resigned membership and there are Received Amounts still unpaid to such Creator, the Company shall subtract the Remittance Fee from the total of such Received Amounts, and thereupon shall remit the Received Amounts to an account designated by the Creator within five business days of the 20th of the month immediately following the month containing the date of membership resignation, or the 20th of the month immediately following such immediately following month.
provided, however, that if the unpaid Received Amount is less than the Remittance Fee, the Company shall make no payment to the Creator.</li>
</ol>Article 9: Flaws or Errors in Remittance Account Information<ol>
<li>In the case where a Creator has made a Remittance Request but the Company has been unable to complete the remittance due to a flaw or error in the remittance account information designated by such Creator, the Company shall be entitled to demand the amount of the reverse transaction fee of such remittance from the Creator.
In such case, the Company shall contact the Creator indicating the flaw or error in remittance account information and urging another request for payment.</li>
<li>When the Company has made remittance to a remittance account designated by a Creator pursuant to a Remittance Request by such Creator, the Company will be entitled to deem such payment a payment to the Creator.
In such case, the Company will bear no liability in regard to the accuracy of the relevant remittance account information.</li>
<li>When remittance cannot be made by the remittance date specified in Article 8, Paragraph 7 due to a flaw etc.
in remittance destination information, the Company shall attempt to remit the Sale Proceeds of the relevant Remittance Request within five business days of the 20th of each month, starting from the month immediately following the month in which the remittance date falls.
provided, however, that in the case where the 19th of the month immediately following the month in which a remittance procedure implementation date falls is more than 180 days from the transmission date of the relevant Request, the Company shall not carry out remittance on or after such remittance implementation date, and shall instead act in accordance with the following paragraph.</li>
<li>In the case where remittance cannot be made due to a flaw etc.
in remittance destination information and the 19th of the month immediately following the month containing the date such remittance failed to be implemented is more than 180 days from the transmission date of the relevant Request, the relevant Creator will be deemed to have waived the right to receive the amount of such remittance as of the date such remittance failed to be implemented.</li>
