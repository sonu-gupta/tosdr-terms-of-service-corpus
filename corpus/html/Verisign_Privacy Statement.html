We may also verify the identity of the Authorized Agent.</p> D.
HOW WE VERIFY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS’ REQUESTS TO KNOW AND REQUESTS FOR DELETION <p>We will not respond to requests to know or requests for deletion unless we can verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty.
To verify your identity, when feasible, we will use information about you that we already have.
however, on occasion we may need to request additional information, which we will use only for the purposes of verification.
We may also use a third-party identify verification service.</p>
<p>The information we need to verify your request will depend on the type of request, the sensitivity of the personal information requested, and/or the risk of harm to you.
Upon receipt of your request, we will notify you if we need additional information from you to verify your request.</p> E.
