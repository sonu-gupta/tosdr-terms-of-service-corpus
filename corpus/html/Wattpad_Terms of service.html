</ul>Terms of ServiceLast Revised: May 25, 2018 <br>(Click here to see previous version)<p>Welcome to the Wattpad platform, which is owned and operated by Wattpad Corp.
(<strong>“Wattpad”</strong>
<strong>“we”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>).
These terms of service (which includes our Code of Conduct and our Privacy Policy) (<strong>“Terms of Service”</strong>) are a contract between you and Wattpad.
By using wattpad.com (the <strong>“Site”</strong>), creating your Wattpad account and using the Site or our mobile applications to post various content to the Wattpad community, including stories you create, comments and messages, or to access and view Wattpad content or other user content (together with the Site, the <strong>“Services”</strong>), you’re agreeing to these Terms of Service.
If you don’t agree to any of these terms, you can’t use the Wattpad Services.</p>Back to topBack to topYou Need to be 13<p>Wattpad Services are only for people 13 years old and over.
If we learn someone under 13 is using Wattpad Services, we’ll terminate their account.</p>Back to topBack to topYou Need an Account<p>You can’t browse very much on the Site or use the Services without registering for an account.
To get the most out of the Wattpad platform, you’ll need to register, choose an account name, and set a password.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential.
If you share your account information with anyone, that other person may be able to take control of the account, and we may not be able to determine who is the proper account holder.
We will not have any liability to you (or anyone you share your account information with) as a result of your or their actions under those circumstances.
If you find out that someone’s used your account without your permission, you should report it at support.wattpad.com.</p>Back to topBack to topYour Content is Yours<p>Before posting any content to Wattpad, it is important that you read our Content Guidelines.
If your content does not comply with these guidelines it may be removed at any time.</p>
<p>You own all the rights to the content you create and post on the Wattpad Services.
Of course, if the content wasn’t yours to begin with, putting it on Wattpad doesn’t make it yours.
Don’t submit content you don’t hold the copyright for (unless you have permission, including to grant Wattpad all the rights outlined in these terms).</p>
<p>When you post content to Wattpad, we need the legal permission under applicable copyright laws to display that content to users of the Wattpad Services.
Legally this means you give us a nonexclusive license to publish your content on the Wattpad Services, including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing it).
You’ll need to decide how you want to license your story content to the Wattpad community.
Please read our guide on Copyrights for assistance in making this decision</p>
<p>You’re responsible for the content you post.
This means you assume all risks related to its publication and display, including someone else’s reliance on its accuracy and any claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights.</p>
<p>Wattpad is a free service and to continue to make it free you understand that we enable advertising on the Services, including in connection with the display of your content or other information.
We may also use your Content to promote the Services.
We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.</p>
<p>In your use of the Services you may enter into additional terms and conditions and other agreements that alter or override these Terms of Service, such as when you enter a contest or join a special program like our Wattpad Stars.
In case of any conflict or inconsistency, the terms and conditions of those additional terms and agreements would override these Terms of Service.</p>Back to topBack to topOur Rights in the Services<p>We reserve all rights in the Sites’ and the Services look and feel, and in our content.
You may not copy or adapt any portion of our code or visual design elements (including logos) without express written permission from Wattpad or as set out in this clause.
Please do not use our logo or trademarks in any way that might suggest Wattpad endorses a particular product or service, or you have a business relationship with Wattpad.</p>
<p>Please do not alter, stretch, condense, embellish, add sparkles to, or otherwise change our logo in any way.
We’re pretty proud of our logo, and we’d like to keep it as it is.
Still not sure what to do with our logo? Check out our full Brand Guidelines.</p>
<p>Wattpad may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the Services, at any time, without notice.
We can remove any content you post or submit for any reason.
Wattpad may access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of the Services, its users and the public.</p>Back to topBack to topHow We Deal with Copyright Issues<p>Wattpad has adopted a policy toward copyright infringement on the Services in accordance with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”).
While our policy is based on the US law we apply this same policy globally to all jurisdictions in which our Services are available.
If you’d like to submit a claim of copyright infringement, please visit our page on Reporting Copyright Infringement.
Wattpad reserves the right to remove content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you or anyone else.
In appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate a user’s account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>
<p>We sometimes come across websites that have illegally scraped content from Wattpad.
When we find these sites we do our best to have them shutdown.
In order to act on behalf of our users we need to have your legal permission to do that so we ask for it here when you sign up.
You authorize us to act as your agent to issue take down notices under the DMCA and/or any other similar legislation that allows for the submission of requests to Internet service providers and any other person involved in the illegal posting for the removal of infringing or allegedly infringing copyright materials that are contained in or displayed on such service providers platforms and/or services.</p>Back to topBack to topThings You Should and Shouldn’t Do<p>Millions of people use the Wattpad platform.
We expect all of them to behave responsibly and help keep this a nice place.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you.

<p>
