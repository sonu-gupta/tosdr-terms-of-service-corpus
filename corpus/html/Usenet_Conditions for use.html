Consequently, Usenet.nl is not subject to a general obligation to supervise information put on line by user nor to a general obligation to investigate the facts or circumstances from illegal activities.</p>
<p>Therefore, Usenet.nl does not influence the contents posted by users on the various discussion groups under any circumstances.
The contents of the discussion groups are exclusively dependent upon the users-authors.
they cannot be attributed to usenet.nl.</p>
<p>Taking into account the data diffused on Usenet, the contents of the discussion groups cannot be controlled by Usenet.nl (in the same way the suppliers to Internet such as Orange and Free cannot control the contents present on Internet).</p> 1.
General conditions <p>When you register, you declare that you are at least 18 years old.
</p>
<p>On the discussion groups, you must respect the rules of behaviour (Netiquette), international agreements and the laws in force.
Concerning the legal framework and in order to act like a responsible person, the user must necessarily be over 18 years of age.</p>

2004-575 dated 21 June 2004 for trust in numerical economy, usenet.nl is in agreement with the battle of crimes against humanity, incitement toward racial hatred, child pornography, incitement toward violence, attacks to human dignity, oppression, as well as illegal activities regarding money games.</p>

Netiquette is a charter which defines the rules of behaviour and politeness adopted on the first media of communications made available on the Internet.
The official document defining the rules of Netiquette is RFC 1855, issued in October 1995.
Netiquette's golden rule is: Don't use the Internet as a shield to do something you wouldn't do during a real face-to-face conversation with your correspondent.
In Usenet, each user can, must and has the right to express his opinion as long as he/she does not offend anyone.

<p>The Usenet user is asked not to participate in a group as soon as he/she joins it.
At first, the user is advised to take some time to assimilate recent discussions, pick out the regular participants (who will undoubtedly be those with whom you will be in touch with most), and identify the subjects and topics that are upsetting, in order to avoid any misunderstanding that could end in you having the reputation of not being a very serious participant.</p>
