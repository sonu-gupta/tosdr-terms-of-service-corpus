<strong>20.
Dispute Resolution: Arbitration.</strong>
</p>
<p>We and you both agree to make a reasonable, good faith effort to resolve any disputes between us informally.
If we can't, this is what happens next:</p>
<p>
<strong>20.1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration</strong>.
You agree to resolve all disputes, claims, demands, or controversies between us in individual binding arbitration.
This includes without limitation any claims arising from these Terms, any part of the relationship between you and us, or your use of the Websites, Games, Organized Play, or Services.
This section applies whether the dispute or claim is based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, misrepresentation or any other legal doctrine.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Initiating Arbitration.</strong> You and Wizards agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.
If a party who intends to seek arbitration must, they must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days after the notice is received, the party seeking redress may commence an arbitration.&nbsp;You may initiate an arbitration proceeding by sending Wizards a written notice explaining the claim and what remedy you want from Wizards.
If you initiate arbitration against Wizards, you must send a copy to Wizards at the following address: Wizards of the Coast LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, 1600 Lind Avenue, Ste.
400, Renton, Washington.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration administration.</strong>&nbsp;Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.
(“<strong>JAMS</strong>”) subject to the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (You agree that the arbitration shall be administered by&nbsp;JAMS&nbsp;in the Seattle, Washington area residents of North and South America.
Japan, for residents of Asia.
and in London for residents of Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Process</strong>.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators and mutually agreed upon by the parties.
The determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court.
JAMS will administer the arbitration and it will be conducted in the English language.
It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person at a mutually agreed location.
The arbitration hearing must commence within thirty (30) days from the appointment of the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed to by you and Wizards.
JAMS will only have power to arbitrate the dispute between you and us and not in relation to other people under this particular arbitration.
Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Confidentiality.</strong>&nbsp;You and Wizards agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential.
However, the prevailing party in any arbitration may file the arbitration award with any court of competent jurisdiction to have that award confirmed in a court order or judgment.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Costs.</strong>&nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules and pursuant to applicable law.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10, 000.00 USD), Wizards will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with this User Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.7.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Additional Terms</strong>.
You also agree that: (i) no finding or stipulation of fact in any other arbitration, judicial or similar proceeding may be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between the parties).
and (ii) and no conclusion of law in any other arbitration may be given any weight in any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between the parties).</p>
<p>YOU AND WIZARDS BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS ARVITRATION PROVISION, WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
We further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation.
However, the arbitrator shall have the authority to shift such fees and costs to ensure that you do not pay significant forum fees.
In addition, you shall not be required to pay any type of fee or cost in arbitration that you would not have had to pay had you been free to file your claim in court.
Discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in a court, but each side will be permitted discovery sufficient to present or defend their claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.8.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Waiver of Collective Action (aka Class Action) Remedies.</strong>
</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you and Wizards agree not under any circumstances to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration.
You and we agree that to the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) no arbitration shall be joined with any other, including without limitation any arbitration involving any other current or former customer, end user or licensee of Wizards, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
(ii) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.
and (iii) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<p>If the agreement in this Section 20.7 not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration is found unenforceable, you and Wizards agree that it will not be severable: this entire section will be deemed unenforceable and any claim or dispute will therefore be resolved in Arbitration as outlined above.
The arbitrator may also award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).</p>
