Cookies and Related Tracking Technologies
<strong>What are cookies?</strong>
<p>We may collect information using tracking technologies such as “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites.</p>
<p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, issued directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Services.
and (2) third party cookies, which are issued by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>
<strong>Cookies we use</strong>
<strong>Type of cookie</strong>
<strong>Purpose&nbsp;</strong>
<em>Essential Cookies &nbsp.
&nbsp;</em>
These cookies are essential to provide you with Services available through our Sites and to enable you to use their features fully.
For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these cookies, the Services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those Services.
<em>Functionality &nbsp;Cookies</em>
These cookies allow us to remember choices you make when you visit our Sites, such as remembering your language preferences, and remembering your login details.
The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use our Services.
<em>Analytics and Performance Cookies</em>
These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites and how users use Services.
The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor, though it includes IP addresses that can be used to do so.
It includes the number of visitors to each Site, the websites that referred them to that Site, the pages visited and for how long, the time of day of that session, whether this is a new or repeat visit, and other similar information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use this information to help operate our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of utilization of all our Services.
<em>Social Media Cookies</em>
These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button related to our Services, or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn or Twitter.
The social media site will record that you have done this.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Disabling cookies</strong>
<p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings.
In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help,” “tools,” or “edit” facilities).
Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.
NOTE: Many of our Sites will not function unless cookies are enabled, and you may be prevented from accessing a Site until cookies are enabled.</p>
<p>Further information about cookies, including which cookies we use, how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, see our Cookie FAQ and Cookie Listing in the CITI Program Support Center.</p>
4.
Pixel Tags and Related Tracking Technologies
<p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Sites to track the actions of users of our Services.
Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages.
Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively.
The information we collect using pixel tags may be linked to your personal data.</p>
5.
Advertising
<p>We currently do not use other companies to serve third-party advertisements when you visit and use the Services.</p>
<p>We may use Remarketing with Google Analytics, Facebook, or other social media remarketing tools to advertise online.
This enables third-party vendors, including Google and Facebook, to show our ads on sites across the Internet.
Such third-party vendors, may use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Site.
These remarketing tools do not identify you to use personally unless you respond to an advertisement that you received directly from the service.
For information on how you can opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies for interest-based ads please visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page or control the use of your device identifiers by using your device’s settings options.</p>
