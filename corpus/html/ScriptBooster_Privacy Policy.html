         Before Reading the privacy policy I would like to tell Abdul Rehman (owner) is a privacy-focused user on the internet and I mean it you guys can see at Alpha Tricks Channel how i am leaving the platform of big 3 which does not respect privacy.
I never try to spam the mailboxes we just do campaigns only 2 – 5 times a year which are just to tell about sales or updates.<p>
