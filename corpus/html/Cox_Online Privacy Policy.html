Our Subscription Services are separate and not part of the Online Service.
This Online Privacy Policy will provide you with information as to how Cox collects, uses, and shares information about you, including the choices Cox offers with respect to that information, and applies to your use of any Online Service, regardless of how you access or use it.
It does not apply to Cox’s data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of the Online Service (unless otherwise stated below or at the time of collection).

<u>Online Terms of Use</u>
</b> and consent to Cox’s data collection, use, and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Online Privacy Policy, and any additional privacy statements that may be posted on an applicable part of the Online Service.

</b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>A.<b>
<b>&nbsp.
</b>
</b>Information about You that You Provide.<br>
</b>Cox, and/or its Service Providers (defined below), may collect information you provide directly to Cox and/or its Service Providers via the Online Service.
For example, Cox collects information when you use or register for the Online Service, subscribe to notifications, post on the Online Service, participate in promotional activities, or communicate, use or transact through the Online Service.
In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those third parties.
For more information on Third-Party Services’ data collection and practices see <b>
<u>Section 6</u>
</b>.
For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices see <b>
<u>Section 3</u>
</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information Cox, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party Services may collect may include: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, address, telephone number, social security number, Cox account number, user id and password, PIN, and full payment account number (<b>"Personally Identifiable Information" </b>or <b>"PII"</b>).
and (2) demographic information, such as your gender, age, zip code, interests, and recent and upcoming purchases ("<b>Demographic Information</b>").
Except to the extent required by applicable law, Demographic Information is <b>"non</b>-<b>Personally Identifiable Information"</b> or <b>"non-PII"</b> (i.e., data that is not Personally Identifiable Information under this Online Privacy Policy).
In addition, PII, including, without limitation, Cox-Collected Online PII (defined below), once <b>"De</b>-<b>identified" </b>(i.e., the removal or modification of the personally identifiable elements, or the rendering of personally identifiable elements into non-personally identifiable elements through anonymization, pseudonymization, and/or hashing) is also non-PII and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law.
However, we do not make assurances that De-identified data is not capable of re-identification.
To the extent any non-PII, or PII collected outside of the Online Service, is combined by or on behalf of Cox with PII Cox itself collects directly from you on the Online Service <b>("Cox-Collected Online PII"</b>), Cox will treat the combined data as Cox-Collected Online PII under this Online Privacy Policy.
The definition of "personal information" under certain California laws differs from the definition of PII used in this Online Privacy Policy.

</b>INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES.</b>
</p>
<p>Cox may share non-Personally Identifiable Information, and Personally Identifiable Information that is not deemed Cox-Collected Online PII hereunder (provided that Cox is aware of no restrictions of Cox’s use, if any), with third parties or Cox and their affiliates <b>("Cox Affiliates") </b>for any purpose.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we and third parties may convert your PII, including Cox-Collected Online PII, to non-PII, including without limitation through hashing it or substituting a unique identifier for the PII and we and third parties may use and share that data as permitted by applicable law, including to match data attributes to and from other sources.
Any such third-party activities are subject to their privacy policies and practices.
Cox’s sharing of Cox-Collected Online PII is, however, subject to the following:<br> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<u>Marketing</u>: Subject to your communications choices explained in <b>
<u>Section 11.D</u>
</b>, and the rights of California residents explained in <b>
<u>Section 12</u>
</b> we may use your PII to send you marketing communications.
Absent your consent (which may be by means of opt-in, your election not to opt-out, or a third party interaction described in the next bullet point), however, Cox will not share your Cox-Collected Online PII with third parties, other than Cox Affiliates, for their own direct marketing purposes, except in connection with Corporate Transactions (defined below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Your Disclosure or Consent</u>: As more fully described in <b>
<u>Section 5</u>
</b> (Information You Disclose Publicly or to Others) and <b>
<u>Section 6</u>
</b> (Third-Party Content, Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics), your activities on the Online Service may, by their nature, result in the sharing of your Cox-Collected PII (as well as your other PII and your non-PII) with third parties and by engaging in these activities you consent to that and further sharing and disclosure to third parties.
Such third-party data receipt and collection is subject to the privacy and business practices of that third party, not Cox.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cox may also share any information about you (including, without limitation, Cox-Collected Online PII) for any purposes not inconsistent with this Online Privacy Policy, or our written statements at the point of collection, and otherwise not prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation:<br> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cox’s agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers (collectively <b>"Service Providers"</b>) may receive, or be given access to, your information, including, without limitation, PII, Demographic Information, and Usage Information, in connection with their work on Cox’s behalf, provided however, Cox does not authorize its Service Providers to use Cox-Collected Online PII provided by Cox to the Service Providers to send you direct marketing messages other than related to Cox and Cox Affiliates absent your consent.
For more information on choices Service Providers may offer you see <b>
<u>Section 11</u>
</b>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal process, and, where permitted, in response to a government request.
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Cox believes your actions are inconsistent with Cox’s Online Terms of Use, user agreements, applicable terms or policies, or to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Cox and its employees, the Online Service or its users, including you, or any third party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Cox may share your Cox-Collected PII (as well as your other PII and your non-PII), in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual financing of our business, or merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of Cox assets, or transfer of all or a portion of Cox’s business to another company, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding (<b>"Corporate Transactions"</b>).</p>

</b>SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, AND PROMOTIONS.</b>
</p>
<p>Cox may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a <b>"Promotion"</b>), including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties, which may require submitting PII.
If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including PII, may be disclosed to Cox, co-sponsors, Service Providers, and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as required by law (<i>e.g.</i>, on a winners list).
By entering, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data practices from those contained in this Online Privacy Policy.
Please review those rules carefully.</p>

</b>
</b>INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS.</b>
</p>
<p>The Online Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including PII.
If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Online Service, your UGC will be considered "public" and will be accessible by anyone, including Cox.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, unless otherwise explicitly agreed by us, PII included in UGC is not subject to Cox’s usage or sharing limitations, or other obligations, regarding Cox-Collected Online PII or other PII under this Online Privacy Policy or otherwise, and may be used and shared by Cox and third parties to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law.
Cox encourages you to exercise caution when making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas.= For more information on how UGC is treated under the Online Service, see our <b>
<u>Online Terms of Use</u>
</b> California minors should see <b>
<u>Section 9</u>
</b> regarding potential removal of certain UGC they have posted on the Online Service.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Online Service may offer you the option to send a communication or refer Cox to a friend or other contact.
If so, Cox relies on you to only send to people that have given you permission to do so.&nbsp.
The recipient’s PII you provide (<i>e.g.</i>, name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication, but not used by Cox for any other marketing purpose unless Cox obtains consent from that person.&nbsp.
Your contact information and message may be included in the communication.</p>

These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit PII from you.<br> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain functionalities on the Online Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Online Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third party social networks (<b>"Social Features"</b>).
Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Online Service and a Third-Party Service.

and to otherwise connect the Online Service to a Third-Party Service (<i>e.g.,</i> to pull or push information to or from the Online Service).
If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Online Service (see <b>
<u>Section 5</u>
</b>) or by the Third-Party Service that you use.
Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Online Service (<i>e.g.</i>, by using a hashtag associated with Cox or other Cox Affiliates in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Online Service or otherwise by Cox and Cox Affiliates.
Also, both Cox and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Online Service and any Third-Party Service.<br> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cox may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Online Service and/or on third-party services.
Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Online Service and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of precise location and/or Cross-device Data, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising" (<b>"Online Interest</b>-<b>based Advertising"</b>), which may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left the Online Service (i.e., "retargeting").&nbsp.
Online Interest-based Advertising does not include targeted advertising based on your viewership preferences combined with other related information that may be part of our Subscription Services <b>("Addressable Advertising"</b>).
For more information on that and your choices regarding it see our <b>
<u>Residential Privacy Notice</u>

Information generated by these services (<i>e.g.</i>, your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S.
(or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Online Service, compiling statistic reports on the Online Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Online Service activity and other Internet usage.<br> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cox is not responsible for, and makes no representations regarding, the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services associated with the Online Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

<p>Cox takes reasonable measures to protect Cox-Collected Online PII (excluding public UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Nevertheless, transmission via the Internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and Cox does not guarantee the security of your information collected through the Online Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help protect you and others, Cox and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use of the Online Service, and may collect and use related information including Cox-Collected Online PII including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions.

If you are accessing the Online Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Online Service may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S.
Data protection laws in the U.S.
may be different from those of your country of residence.

Cox does not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("<b>COPPA</b>") (<b>"Children’s Personal Information"</b>) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA.

CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>A.<b>
<b>&nbsp.
</b>
</b>Tracking Technologies Generally.</b>
<br> Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.
Browsers offer different functionalities and options, so you may need to set them separately.
Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies.
For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website <b>
<u>http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html</u>
</b>.
Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Online Service may not work and that when you revisit the Online Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app.
To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.
Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit.
