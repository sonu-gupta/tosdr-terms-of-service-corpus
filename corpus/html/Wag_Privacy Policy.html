         Legal Privacy Policy Effective date: June 9, 2022 <p> We know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and Wag! takes your privacy seriously.
So that you may better understand how we use your data, we’ve provided our privacy guidelines and procedures in the policy below (the “Privacy Policy”).
Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
<b>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</b>
</p>
<p> Remember that your use of the Services is at all times subject to Wag!’s Terms of Service (the “Terms”), which incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference.
Any capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy without definitions have the definitions given to them in the Terms.
</p> What does this Privacy Policy cover? <p> Except as provided herein, this Privacy Policy covers only our data practices for information that we gather from your access or your use of the Services.
With the exception of the specific practices noted in the Supplemental Privacy Notice to California Residents (found at the end of this Privacy Policy), it does not apply to the practices of other companies or people that we don't own or control.
</p> Will Wag ever change this Privacy Policy? <p> We're constantly improving our Services and must also comply with constantly changing federal and state laws, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
We will alert you if there are any material changes by placing a notice on the wagwalking.com site, by sending you an email, via the Services and/or by some other means.
Please note that if you've opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven't provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.
By using, or otherwise accessing, the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, you are effectively agreeing to all of the changes.
</p> What Information does Wag Collect? <p> We obtain information from you through the means discussed below when we provide the Services to you and when you use the Services.
Please note that we need certain types of information to provide the Services to you.
If you do not provide us with the required information, or if you ask us to delete that information, you may no longer be able to access or use certain Services.
</p>
<p>

<p> The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and may include, but is not limited to, the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Identifiers and Contact Information</em>.
We may collect identifiers and other contact information from you, such as your name, email address, phone number, and address.
With your consent, you may also grant us access to your mobile device’s address book, through which we would collect and store on our servers all of your contacts and their contact information.
We use your contact information to help you find friends and other contacts who are Wag! users, and to facilitate you inviting friends and other contacts to use Wag!.</li>
<li>
<em>Information Regarding Pets</em>.
For example, we may collect information regarding your pet, such as vaccinations and health history, age, and videos and photographs of your pet.</li>
<li>

In your use of the Services, you may provide us or our service providers with financial information such as financial account or credit card account information.</li>
<li>
<em>Location Information.</em> We may collect general location information (e.g., inferred from your IP address) or specific location information (i.e., geolocation with your consent).
For example, we may request geolocation information of Pet Care Providers when they are providing services for Pet Owners.
If you use a Wag! Tag, we may also collect location information related to your pet.</li>
<li>
<em>Communications</em>.
We may collect communications you make through the Services, such as when you communicate with us or other users.
For example, Pet Owners may communicate with Pet Care Providers through tools offered on the Services or you may communicate with our customer success team or other members of the Wag! team through email, text message or telephone.
If you send text messages with a Pet Owner or Pet Care Provider using the telephone number for that user available on the Services, we may use a third-party service provider to track these text messages.
We track these text messages for fraud prevention, to enforce our Terms, and for quality and training purposes.
As part of this process, Wag! and its service provider will receive in real time and store data about your text message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the content of the text message.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Information From Affiliates, Business Partners, and Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties</i>

Examples of this include information to verify your identity for fraud prevention, for safety protection purposes, or information that enhances our ability to market products or services that may be of interest to you.

We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.

Whenever you interact with our Services, we and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies such as Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services.

When you use our Services through one of these integrations, we may share your information with that affiliate or business partner.

</p> California Do-Not-Track Disclosure <p> Wag! is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services.
However, Wag! does not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.

<p>&nbsp;</p> Notice of Financial Incentives&nbsp.
<p> We may offer certain programs in which eligible consumers receive rewards or incentives if they opt into sharing certain information with select business partners.
You can opt into the rewards or incentives by expressly directing us to share your information when presented with the option.
Your participation is completely voluntary, and you have a right to withdraw your consent.&nbsp.
If you decide you do not want to participate, you can refrain from opting into this type of data sharing.
</p>
<p> The specific reward or incentive offered, if any, is made available to you when you are given an option to share your information.
The monetary value of the reward or incentive is a reasonable approximation of the monetary value of the sharing of your information.
We have arrived at this estimate based on consideration of multiple factors, including the following:&nbsp.
(1) our reasonable assessment of revenue we may generate as a result of Wag! providing your information to the identified business partner or partners.
and (2) expenses incurred by Wag! in operating its services and partnerships.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Unless you have otherwise provided your affirmative consent, Wag! does not “sell” your personal information as we understand that term to be defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations.
California law may require us to compile metrics for the previous calendar year regarding consumer requests and responses.
