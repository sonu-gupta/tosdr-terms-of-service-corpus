<strong>6.0 Who Do We Share Your Personal Information With?</strong>
<p>
<strong>We do not sell your Personal Information or the content you provide</strong>.
There are certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your Personal Information with third parties, such as under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Your Education Organization</em>
</strong>: The information we collect and store about you is accessible to authorized employees of your Education Organization.
For example, a school principal may use Edsby to quickly find a Parent’s telephone number to call in the case of an emergency.
Your Education Organization controls who has access to information.
We also make usage information available to your Education Organization.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Third parties at the request of the Education Organization</em>
</strong>: Education Organizations may request that we share your Personal Information with additional parties that also provide processing services to the Education Organization.
We only do this when specifically requested and approved in writing by an authorized senior member of the Education Organization.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Microsoft and Google</em>
</strong>: Our Services can be integrated with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace for Education if directed to do so by the Education Organization to enhance productivity.
For example, when a student writes an essay in Microsoft 365 or Google Docs and submits it to their educator via the Edsby platform, Edsby can make a copy of the selected file and make it available to the educator via the Edsby Services.
Also, when Edsby integrates with these systems it provides a way for the End-User to log into Edsby by using Microsoft or Google authentication credentials.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Cloud service providers</em>
</strong>
<em>: </em>A carefully selected small number of companies provide essential elements of our cloud-based Service.
We limit the information we share with these service providers through contractual, administrative and technical means.
For example, we store Personal Information with Microsoft, the provider of our Azure hosting service, and protect it with encryption.
Service providers may not use the information disclosed to them for any other purpose other than to provide us with a service.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Legal authorities, as required by law</em>
</strong>
<em>: </em>The information we process and store may be disclosed by us to legal authorities if we are required to do so by law.
We may also disclose, at our discretion, some information we collect and store where we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with the rights, property or rules of the Education Organization using our Services, or someone who may cause or be at risk of imminent bodily harm, or someone who may be violating the Terms of Use of our Services.
In such cases, the Education Organization that is managing this instance of our Service will be informed.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Business transaction</em>
</strong>
<em>: </em>We may transfer our assets and rights to our Services, including information in our Services, in the event of a merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control.
In such a case, your Education Organization will be provided with notice and will have the option of opting out of our Services.
We will limit the disclosure of Personal Information to only what is necessary and limit the use of the information to the purpose for which the personal information was collected before the transaction and in accordance with applicable laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>We limit who we share your Personal Information with.
We also limit what information we share and how third parties may use, access, process or store such information in the course of performing their duties for us.
When we disclose Personal Information, we minimize the disclosure to only what is necessary, in accordance with instructions from our Education Organization customers, and in compliance with appropriate privacy, confidentiality, and security measures.</p>
<p>Should there be a conflict between our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use and our contract with an Education Organization, the terms and obligations set out in our specific contract with your Education Organization will prevail.</p>
<p>
<strong>We do not have control over the Personal Information that Education Organizations may disclose to third parties</strong>.
For example, an Education Organization may export certain Personal Information collected in Edsby and make it accessible to others at their discretion.</p>
<strong>7.0 How Do We Protect Your Information?</strong>
<p>We are committed to protecting the information we store about you.
Edsby employs a variety of physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to protect Personal Information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure.
We have taken measures to protect the Personal Information on our Services, which include data encryption, firewalls and access controls for staff and vendors, as well as physical access controls to our facilities.
Some other security measures we implement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limiting account creation to only those individuals the Education Organization selects.
Persons outside the Education Organization cannot create an account.</li>
<li>You may only access Edsby within an Education Organization with your user ID and password.
Typically these credentials are provided and managed by the Education Organization.</li>
<li>The ability for Education Organizations to implement role-based access and usage of an account, which limits what you can do and what information you can see.
For example, educators have limited access to students they can view on the Services (e.g.
only students in their school) and what they can see on the student profile.
Parents can only see the profile of their own children and staff at the school(s) that their children attend.</li>
<li>All data sent between the Edsby server and Edsby client (web browser, smartphone app, tablet app) is encrypted.</li>
<li>Restricting access to Personal Information to those Edsby staff members who need to know that information for the purpose set out in this Policy and ensuring those staff members are trained in the company’s information protection policies.</li>
<li>Adhering to a formal standard for Information Security.
CoreFour Inc.
is ISO 27001 certified.</li>
</ul>
<strong>8.0 How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?</strong>

Your Education Organization determines how long they retain Personal Information collected via our Services.</p>

<strong>10.0 Children’s Privacy</strong>
<p>We comply with our obligations outlined in the <em>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</em> (“FERPA”) and the <em>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule</em> (“COPPA”), U.S.
federal laws designed to protect the privacy rights of children.</p>
<p>We are a service provider to Education Organizations, which disclose Personal Information to us about students and parents either via existing student records or those developed directly on our Services.
The information we collect is limited to what we need to fulfill our obligations as outlined in our contracts with Education Organizations.
The disclosures are authorized by FERPA.
We do not use your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide our Services to Education Organizations and improve our Services to you.</p>
<p>In accordance with COPPA, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 unless and until an Education Organization has provided us with authority for a student under the age of 13 to use our Services.
Further, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 in a manner not permitted by COPPA.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian who believes that we have inadvertently collected or stored Personal Information about your child without proper consent, please contact your Education Organization and we will work with them to investigate and delete any such information to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
