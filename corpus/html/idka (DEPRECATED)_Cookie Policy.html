How Idka uses tracking technologies
<p>We do not use tracking technologies in the classical sense.
We are not interested in making money on your online movements or activities, and therefore, we have no interest in this technology.
We do not allow any third party to place cookies in connection with our services.</p>
<p>We do, however, need to use persistent cookies to identify you, for instance to allow trusted devices (automatic re-login), to store certain preferences and for internal user statistics.
We employ encrypted cookies that cannot be used by others.
You may deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings of your web browser.
Cookies that are already stored may be deleted at any time.
If you deactivate cookies, certain functionality may not be available, but we try to deliver the service to extent possilbe in any caseas we are not the business of exploiting you.</p>
<p>We use Matomo (formerly Piwiki) to collect and process certain information in order to promote Idka and deliver the Idka Service.
We do not accept third party cookies on the www.idka.com website.
nor on the idka.com service site.</p>
<p>When you visit our site or use our Service, we will store: the website from which you visited us from, the parts of our site you visit, the date and duration of your visit, your anonymized IP address and information from the device (device type, operating system, screen resolution, language, country you are located in, and web browser type) you used during your visit.
We process this usage data in Matomo Analytics for statistical purposes, to improve our site, track conversion and to recognize and stop any misuse.
Idka own this data alone, and we will never use it for advertising or share, sell nor otherwise disseminate it.</p>
<p>The conversion tracking on our landing page is used in conjunction with marketing campaigns.
The information garnered from this technology is exclusively used to evaluate the impact of our own marketing.
The information is not used to track your online presence nor to target you for any advertising or other information.
It is important to note that this is strictly limited to our landing page, and is not present in the Idka service.</p>
<p>Therefore, we truly only use cookies to provide a better service (such as easier login, remembering settings, etc.) and to make people aware that there is an alternative to classic social media and the Stalker Economy.</p>
<p>By using our services, you accept that we use cookies to the extent explained in this policy.
If you do not accept our cookies policy, you may change your browser settings not to accept cookies.
Please note, however, that this will lead to our services not functioning as smoothly as it has been designed to do.</p>

What are cookies?
<p>There are several ways that websites and social services track your activities.
The most common way is the placement of a HTTP cookie (or browser cookie), which, in essence, is a small information capsule stored on your device when you access a site or service.</p>
<p>Cookies may be encrypted and will be used by the service provider and any of its partners, or other third parties that have gained access to the site.
There are several forms of cookies, such as zombie cookies and cookies that are combined with URLs, query strings, JSON Web tokens, Etags, DOM properties, “Local Stored Objects” (also known as “Flash Cookies”), HTML5 Web storage cookies, etc.
All of are them referred to as cookies, but the potential for use and abuse varies according to its type.
Zombie cookies, for example, have the ability to re-create themselves after they have been deleted (using information stored separately in different locations on your device).
Conversion pixels are small pieces of code on a webpage allowing a service to determine if you arrived at the page (Web and mobile) from a specific ad campaign.</p>

How are cookies used?
<p>It is not uncommon that more than 20 cookies are placed on your machine for various purposes when you access a service just once.
Some are First Party Cookies (placed there by the service-domain) you access and some are Third Party Cookies that are cookies placed on your device by partners of the service you access (or possible malicious players).</p>
<p>Social media services use cookies and tracking technologies, but they also allow a vast array of partners to use their services to place various types of cookies on your device (third party cookies).</p>
<p>The use of cookies has expanded and deepened and they are now used to track and store users’ actions and behaviour on the Internet, to trace where you are coming from when you land on a site, where you are going to, what ads you look at and click on, etc.</p>
<p>In recent times, added to this, is advance methodology to make devices leave digital footprints (screen attributes unique to each device – like a finger print) and combining this with IP addresses from which the device is used over time and so forth, so it will be more or less impossible to escape the tracking.
Ostensibly it is to “improve the service”, but the meaning of “improving the service” has become “know everything there is to know about you” to get hold of an asset that can be sold.
And, then there is the added specter of misuse, criminal exploitation, and theft of this information.</p>
<p>In order to force you to give up information, it is often not possible to block cookies (an option you have in your browser) without losing the ability to access or use a sites or service, or you may lose functionality witch is essential, but not necessarily linked to the content of the cookies themselves.
On other sites, if you have deleted a cookie, you may be harassed with the need to re-confirm user terms each time you access a site.</p>
<p>Therefore, the option of denying cookies creates, in our opinion, an illusion of choice – In fact you do not have a choice.
But, with Idka you have one!</p>
