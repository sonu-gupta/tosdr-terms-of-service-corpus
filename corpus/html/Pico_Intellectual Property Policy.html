        Pico Intellectual Property Policy<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Pico respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we hope everyone using our Service does the same.
<br>
<br>Anyone who believes that their rights have been infringed on Pico may notify us via email (email address:<strong>picoip@picoxr.com</strong>).
But contacting the developer directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and in a way that is more beneficial to you, the developer and Pico.
<br>
<br>When we receive proper notice as required below, we will work to remove or disable access to App that has been identified as infringement.
If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we may notify the App developer with a copy of your notice so that he or she can make a counter notification.
Please note that Pico is not in a position to adjudicate disputes between third parties, and may not be able to remove the App reported.
<br>
<br>If the developer receives an infringement notification that the developer believes to be in error or believes that it's authorized to use the content, the developer can reach out to the reporter directly to request a retraction.
The developer may also provide us with a counter-notification as requested below via our email <strong>picoip@picoxr.com.
</strong>
<br>
<br>When we receive a counter notification, we may reinstate the App in question or we may ask for more information or reject the counter-notification when necessary.
Please note that, where appropriate or authorized by law, we will forward the entire counter notification to the original reporter.
We reserve the right to refuse reinstating the app again.
