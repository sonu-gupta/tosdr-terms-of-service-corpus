<strong>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
</p>
<p>We try to limit our disclosures of personally identifiable information to those that are important to carrying on our business.

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to a legal process–for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
We also may disclose personally identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if our assets are acquired by another entity.&nbsp;Agents and contractors of Hubbard Radio and its subsidiaries who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.</p>
<p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
