What Data Do We Collect?
<p>There are three basic categories of information we collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>The information you choose to give us.</li>
<li>Information we get when you use our services.</li>
<li>Information we get from third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories:</p>
<p>The Site collects personal information when you register with Spike, when you use the Service and when you visit Spike’s pages.
Information which you submit to Spike during registration or performance of other actions at Spike, or when you use the Service may be recorded in Spike’s designated database (the&nbsp;<strong>“Database”</strong>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use our Services we collect personal data about you, as described below.
The term “<strong>Personal Data</strong>” means any data that enables a person to be identified.
We collect Personal Data that you provide to us when you purchase our Service and register for a Spike account, such as your family name, first name, profile photo, postal address, email address, telephone numbers, date of birth, data relating to your transactions on the Websites, detail of your orders and subscriptions, payment information, such as payment card details (collected by our payment service provider), and any other information about you that you choose to provide us with.
Alternatively, Spike may offer you to log in through a third party provider, e.g.
using your Facebook account, in which case the terms and privacy policy of such third party service may apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit our Website, our servers record information, including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit the Website.
This log data includes your Internet Protocol address (from which we understand the country you are connecting from at the time you visit the Site), browser type and settings, the date and time of your request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to provide you with the Service, Spike may securely access or store your email address and password, your emails and other conversations and your contact list (including any public images attached to contacts in the list).
Data may be deleted from our servers after a few days, and Spike will not be liable for any data deleted due to the passage of time.
In addition, when you visit Spike or use the Service, we may periodically collect your device number or IP address (the location of your device on the Internet), track your geographic location, monitor installation and online behavioral information recorded during user sessions and technical data and related information (including but not limited to technical information about your device, applications installed on it, its operating system and your operator).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you communicate with us actively, for example, contact us with questions, comments or for purposes of feedback, information or customer/technical support, we may collect the information you share..
This may include your contact information and any other personal information you choose to provide through such communication.
We may also collect such information when you ask to be included in our mailing lists as they may be available from time to time, or express an interest in hearing more about our offerings, in order to send you information in the future regarding us, our partners, related services, promotions or events.
Another way we may actively collect your contact information is through surveys we may conduct from time to time in respect of our products.
Participation and providing information in surveys is optional.
All such communications may be publicly available and should reflect how much you want other users to know about you.&nbsp;<strong>We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage you to think carefully about what information about yourself you disclose in your comments or submissions</strong>.</p>
