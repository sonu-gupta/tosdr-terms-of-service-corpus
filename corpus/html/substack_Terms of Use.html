If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or our products and services, please contact us at tos@substackinc.com.</p>

</p>
<p>Substack is free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of Substack, or your account, for any reason at our discretion.
We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important Posts you may have uploaded to your account, but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Substack.</p>
<p>Substack also allows you to delete your account at any time.<strong> If you'd like to delete your account, you can do so from your account page.</strong> When you delete your account, any Posts associated with that account will also be deleted.
However, any Post that you have made public may remain available.&nbsp;</p>
