However, we do allow certain third-party partners and providers to collect information about consumers directly through our services for purposes of analyzing and optimizing our services, delivering ads, providing content and ads that are more relevant, measuring statistics and the success of ad campaigns, and detecting and reporting fraud.
To the extent this practice is interpreted to constitute a “sale” under the CCPA, please see our Cookies And Similar Technologies and Interest Based Advertising section below for more information including how to exercise your rights to opt-out of cookies, analytics and personalized advertising.</p>
<p>7.5 California consumers may make a request pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by contacting us at Drop Support.

<p>7.9 <strong>Do Not Track Signals.</strong> California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals.
Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard to recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time.
