They should still stay on track with their given topic.</li>
</ol>
</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<b>Do not abuse any feature of the forums or your privileges may be revoked.</b>
<ol>
<li>Do not abuse the resources system.<ol>
<li>Posting malicious resources is strictly not allowed.
This includes plugins which are malicious towards players (e.g.
crashing their client).</li>
<li>Posting someone else's plugin or resource is not allowed.
This includes minor edits such as configuration changes and code taken directly from tutorials or other resources.<ol>
<li>"Premium Resources" are held to a higher standard of originality and have greater punishments associated with breaching of these rules.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Refrain from commenting on "Premium Resources" which you have not purchased, especially if you are criticising its price or worth.</li>
<li>Do not distribute "Premium Resources" to those who have not purchased them.</li>
<li>Using pay-per-click sites such as adf.ly or similar services to distribute resources is forbidden.</li>
<li>You are allowed to obfuscate your resources, however the decompiled code must be somewhat legible by staff and is subject to the following limitations:<ol>
<li>Free resources may only use basic name obfuscation (ie what Mojang does with Minecraft).<ol>
<li>This limits you to certain free publicly available obfuscators (eg Proguard, yGuard).<ol>
<li>See https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/420746/ for a complete list of approved obfuscators and settings.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Do not use string obfuscation or anything that hides code flow.</li>
<li>In exceptional circumstances exceptions to this rule may be granted.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>All resources must retain an unobfuscated package root and main class name.<ol>
<li>com.example.myplugin.MyPlugin is an acceptable main class name, com.example.myplugin.a, a.a.a.MyPlugin or a.a.a.a.
are not.</li>
<li>com.example.myplugin.a.a is an acceptable secondary class name, a.a.a.SecondaryClass or a.a.a.a are not.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Obfuscation designed to crash inspection tools is not allowed.<br>
</li>
<li>All parts of a class must be visible when decompiled and it must be clear what all parts of the code is supposed to do.<ol>
<li>Class encryption is not allowed.
It does not add meaningful security anyway.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Obfuscated class or member names should not be unnecessarily long or difficult to inspect.<ol>
<li>Long (eg llililililillllllliiiillliiiiillii) or illegal (eg CON1) names are not more secure than any other method of name obfuscation — don't use them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Obfuscation techniques that unnecessarily increase the file size are not allowed.</li>
<li>We may request you use a different obfuscator or none at all.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to remove obfuscated resources without consultation, especially if we believe obfuscation is being used to hide rule-breaking code.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You may not use the name of other servers or brands to advertise your resource unless consent has been given.
This means that resources such as "XXXX inspired by YYYY.net" / "AAAA like BBBB" are not allowed unless YYYY.net has given permission for their brand to be used in this way.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This includes the "post ratings" feature which is designed to be used appropriately and in moderation.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to bypass restrictions such as minimum character or word count.</li>
<li>Do not access the forums via automated mechanisms.</li>
<li>Do not blank out question threads after you have received an answer.

<li>Where SpigotMC software is concerned, discussion, support and distribution should be limited to official versions and sources.</li>
<li>Resources that require third party software to load (e.g.
Skript) should clearly state so in the description.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<b>No advertising servers, products, or services outside of the "Services &amp.
Recruitment" section.</b>
<ol>
<li>Many of our users are already very busy with their own servers, so advertising your own is not generally productive.
Instead consider using the "Rate My Server!" section for suggestions on improvement.<ol>
<li>Only post an IP or server address if it is necessary for the purpose of the thread.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Do not post threads asking for the community to "Name your X", including, but not limited to usernames, servers, services, products, etc.<ol>

</li>
<li>Please keep advertisements limited to what is reasonably necessary.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Advertising must be limited to the resource page itself.
You may not use resource updates, the resource itself (eg console or in-game messages), or any other location for any advertisement whatsoever.<br>
</li>
<li>Advertisements must be directly related to running or developing a Spigot based Minecraft server or network.<ol>
<li>SpigotMC reserves the right to determine what constitutes an advertisement and to disallow specific advertisements at any time for any reason.</li>
<li>Advertisements may not include products or services in competition with SpigotMC or its affiliates.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You must have an actual business arrangement with the advertisement target or sponsor.<ol>
<li>This means that you cannot promote your resource by feigning endorsement or sponsorship.</li>

</li>
<li>The advertisement must not contravene other forum rules.</li>
<li>Authors that are found to be abusing the use of advertisements may lose the option to do so.</li>

<ol>
<li>If you have a legitimate need for a second account, please email tmp-support@spigotmc.org to request permission first.<ol>

</ol>
</li>
<li>You are responsible for all actions performed by your account.<ol>
<li>Keeping your account secure is your responsibility.

If the IP address you use is shared with banned users, you too may be banned.</li>

If however your account name contains personally identifiable information, then you may be granted one name change, again at our discretion.<br>
</li>
<li>Using an alternative account to bypass a ban or other punishment will result in an extension of your punishment.
If you wish to obtain more information about your ban, please send an email to tmp-support@spigotmc.org.</li>
<li>Discussion of your ban, or other user's bans is strictly prohibited.</li>
<li>Accounts may not be sold without specific permission from SpigotMC.
If there is any indication you are attempting to, or have sold your account it will be permanently banned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<b>Be sure to follow any and all section specific rules, and their implications across the forums as a whole.</b>
<ol>
<li>Services and Recruitment</li>
<li>Resources<ol>
<li>Resource reviews will not be moderated or removed by staff unless they violate a general forum rule.<ol>
<li>This means that "false" reviews will not be removed unless there is evidence of targeted harassment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If users are found to be abusing the review system, specific punishments may be enacted.</li>
<li>Resources may only be transferred to another user if the current author requests so via the report feature.

<li>
<b>If you require staff assistance, please open a report.
Do not private message staff members.</b>
<ol>

Typical wait times for a response are on the order of one week.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<b>These rules are subject to change at any time and are in no way permanent.
We are not responsible for notifying you of changes.</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Moderator's decisions are final and may involve enforcement of other unlisted rules.</b>
<ol>
<li>Any complaints about a moderator's actions must be directed to the administration team at admin@spigotmc.org.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>Punishment System</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Punishments for violations of these rules are issued by moderators and highly dependent on context.
The following is provided as a guideline only and extreme variations may be encountered:<ul>
<li>The more specific the rule is, the harsher the punishment will be.
This means for example that if you make a slightly rude post, it may just be deleted with a warning, whereas if you post a malicious resource then the punishment may be an instant ban.</li>
<li>Moderators will always consider previous behaviour before issuing a punishment.
This means that persistent rule breakers will be subject to progressively harsher punishments and may ultimately be permanently excluded from our services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
