<p>Further, our online service providers or business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across websites.
We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those websites.</p>

For example, we may collect and aggregate non-personal information about you and other customers who visit certain areas of our Site.
Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you.</p> 2.
