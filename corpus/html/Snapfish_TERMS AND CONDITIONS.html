You will immediately notify Snapfish of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>Your Snapfish account credentials will work across all Snapfish websites.
However, while the majority of your data is accessible in your account across all websites, certain information, such as your projects and order history, may not be accessible because our service providers and product offerings vary between regions, and a project you start in one region may not be available for purchase in another.
When you switch between regions for the first time, you will be given an opportunity to provide certain consents, as appropriate, for that region.</p>
<p>
<strong>For French residents only,</strong> if you provide your phone number, you have the right to object to being contacted by phone for direct marketing purposes at any time, by registering free of charge on www.bloctel.gouv.fr.</p>
