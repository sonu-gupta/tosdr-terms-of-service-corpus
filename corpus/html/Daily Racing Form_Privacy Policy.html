<strong>Cookie Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>We also employ cookie technology to help subscribers move faster through our site.
When a subscriber signs on to DRF Online, we pass several cookies to that user's computer.

This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of checking our registration database each time a page is requested.
The cookie is deleted when a user chooses the log out feature to terminate their session.
We also employ cookie technology to store subscribers' User Names and Passwords.
