<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</b> Bodybuilding.com may share aggregated information (i.e., information about our users that we combine so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other anonymized information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.
We also provide aggregated statistics and insights that help our vendors and partners understand how people are engaging with their content, listings, products, and other content on the Bodybuilding.com Platform(s).</p>
<p>Bodybuilding.com also provides advertisers and product vendors with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing on Bodybuilding.com’s Platform(s).
however, we do not share information that personally identifies you (e.g., information such as your name or e-mail address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.
For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers and/or product vendors (e.g., that an ad or product campaign was seen by a male between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Germany and likes gainer protein powders) to help them better understand their audience, including their preferences and wants.</p>

When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address.</li>

In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
Also, in the unlikely event that substantially all of our assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
