<strong>Your Privacy Matters</strong>
<p>At Structural, we value trust: the trust between co-workers, employees and employer, users and our company.
Maintaining your trust extends to the decisions we make about how we gather and respect your personal information.
We’ve crafted the policy below to be as clear and straightforward as possible.
Our aim is for you—our users—to always feel informed and empowered with respect to your privacy on Structural.</p>
Introduction

Our registered users (“Users”) share their professional identities, engage with their network, exchange knowledge and professional insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining your trust is our top priority, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li>We protect your personal information and will only provide it to third parties: (1) with your consent.
(2) where it is necessary to carry out your instructions.
(3) as reasonably necessary in order to provide our features and functionality to you.
(4) when we reasonably believe it is required by law, subpoena or other legal process.
or (5) as necessary to enforce our agreements or protect the rights, property, or safety of Structural, our Users, and the public.</li>
<li>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Structural.com, the Structural mobile applications, Structural Teams application, and all other Structural websites, services, applications, platforms, and other products and services (collectively the “Services”).

Mobile Information</strong>
</p>
<p>When you use the mobile versions of our Sites, we may collect the unique device identifier assigned to that device by phone makers, carriers, or makers of the operating system (the “Device ID”).

Additionally, we may use Device IDs to monitor suspicious activity.
For example, if we detect that a single account on a Site is being accessed from multiple devices, as determined by tracking the Device IDs that access an account, we may contact the user to ensure that such access has been authorized by the user.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.18.

</p>
<p>Any feedback, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, or the like that you send to Structural will be treated as being non-confidential and nonproprietary, and Structural will be free to use such information for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services incorporating the information.</p>

How We Use Cookies.
</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance your experience with our Sites, many of our pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files that are placed on your computer to store your preferences or for other record-keeping purposes.
Cookies and other user tracking mechanisms (e.g., local shared objects), by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our Site.
However, once you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie or other tracking mechanism.
We may use cookies and other user tracking mechanisms, including “persistent cookies”, which will remain on your computer even after you close your browser, to understand Site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Sites.
For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Site (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our Site), and to save your password in password-protected areas.
We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.
While most browsers are set to accept cookies and other tracking devices by default, you can set yours to refuse tracking devices or to alert you before accepting them.
However, by disabling tracking devices, you may not have access to the entire set of features of our Sites.
Your browser manufacturer has information on changing the default setting for your specific browser.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.2.
Other Internet Technology.
</strong>
</p>
<p>Structural may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use of the Site or to track your response to email messages that we send you in connection with the Sites or Services.
Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email.
Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.
Structural may use web beacons to improve your experience on the Site, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages so that the Site can deliver relevant content.
Our web beacons may collect some contact information (for example, the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).</p>
<p>
<strong>6.3.
Analytics Software.
</strong>
</p>
<p>We use analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Applications on your mobile devices.

7.
No Guarantees
<p>
<strong>7.1.
Factors Beyond Our Control.
</strong>
</p>
<p>While this Privacy Statement expresses Structural’s standards for protection of personally identifiable information, Structural is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met.
There may be factors beyond our control that may result in unintentional disclosure of data.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the User Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.2.
Compromise or Breach.
</strong>
</p>
<p>In the unfortunate event that your “personally identifiable information” (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by email (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last email address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances.
provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation.</p>
