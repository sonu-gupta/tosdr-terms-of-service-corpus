</ul> Newgrounds Wiki: Privacy Policy Here's a breakdown of what information we collect and store about you and why and how we might process it.
Newgrounds is an American company, all data processing takes part in the U.S.
"Site" is in most cases a reference to newgrounds.com where used below.<br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information - User Accounts</strong>
<br>
<br>
All user accounts, as a bare minimum, store your email address.
You create a username unique to Newgrounds.<br>
<br>
You are able to enter further information, such as your first and last name, although this is not publicly available on the site UNLESS you contribute work to one of the public portals and you choose to use your real name as attribution.<br>
<br>
Most further information is not required UNLESS you enter into one of our revenue programs, at which point we collect your full name and postal address, together with any information required for taxation purposes.<br>
<br>
You are able to enter other publicly available information via your public profile page and can change or withdraw this information at any time.<br>
<br>
<strong>Social Login Integration</strong>
<br>
<br>
We allow you to sign up with and log in via your Facebook and Google accounts.
When you initially sign up for an account via these services, your first name and last name are used to suggest usernames you might want to use on Newgrounds, although whether these are then stored on Newgrounds is up to you.
We do store the email address that's specified in either your Facebook or Google account when you register on Newgrounds via these services.<br>
<br>
<strong>Information Sharing</strong>
<br>
<br>
We do not share your personal information with any third parties, with the exception of any direct and credible requests from enforcement agencies in order to comply with any law, regulation or legal process.
In rare cases, we may also volunteer your information to law enforcement agencies if we receive a subpoena or feel you or actions you make on Newgrounds pose a risk to us or to others.<br>
<br>
We may share information you have provided publicly in order to promote work you have done, or to publicize something you have participated in.
For example, if you have uploaded a game, animation, piece of art or audio, we may promote that work.
Similarly, if you have written an interesting blog article, we may choose to talk about that publicly in our own news posts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Email</strong>
<br>
<br>
You may opt in or out of email subscriptions at any time via your email subscriptions page.<br>
<br>

<br>
We use cookies to store login tokens and minimal information that helps us identify progress or preferences across the site.
For example, the forums store a timestamp of when you last visited.
When you return to the site at a later date, the cookie containing that timestamp is used to identify new posts that you might not have read.<br>
<br>
Older flash based games may store flash cookies on your computer to save your game progress, preferences or high scores.<br>
<br>
Newer games may also store some of their resources on third party websites.
