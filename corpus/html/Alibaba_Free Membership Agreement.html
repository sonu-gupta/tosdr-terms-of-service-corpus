Members are hereby made aware that there may be risks of dealing with people acting under false pretences.
Alibaba.com uses several techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the Sites.
However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Alibaba.com cannot and does not confirm each free member's purported identity shown on the Sites and can only use reasonable efforts to verify the personal identity of the representative of a seller in mainland China opening a storefront on www.aliexpress.com according to the applicable laws in mainland China.
We encourage you to use the various tools available on the Sites, as well as common sense, to evaluate with whom you are dealing.</p>
