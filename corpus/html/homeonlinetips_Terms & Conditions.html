<li>
<strong>
<u>Methods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes.</u>
</strong> All payments must be made through your Visa, MasterCard or Discover (if available).
We currently do not accept cash, personal or business checks or any other payment form, although in the future we may change this policy.
Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement, and not these Terms, to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.
You represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so.
YOU, AND NOT COMPANY, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY.
You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred.
Unless you notify Company of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they are accepted by you for all purposes.
If Company does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Company or its agents.
Sales taxes, or other taxes, customs, import/export charges, or similar governmental charges are not included in the price of the products.
You are responsible for paying any such taxes or charges imposed on your purchases, including, but not limited to, sales, use or value-added taxes.

<strong>
<u>Order Acceptance Policy.</u>
</strong> Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not mean that we accept your order, nor is it confirmation of our offer to sell.
Company reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason.
Company further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item.
Your order will be deemed accepted by Company upon our delivery of products or services that you have ordered.
We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order or if we provide you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that: (a) we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if your credit card has already been charged for the order) or (b) we will not charge your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided.
Do not assume that a cancellation or change of an order you have placed with Company has been effected until you receive a confirmation from Company via email or the Site.
As stated above, you will be responsible for, and your credit card or third-party payment account may be charged for, the payment of all fees associated with orders already processed or shipped before your cancellation/change request or a request to terminate your account was received.</li>

Additional terms may apply.
If a product you purchased from Company is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging for a credit to your account in the amount of the purchase price.</li>

<p>
<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>
</p>
<p>Arbitration is an alternative to litigation that provides parties with an efficient way to resolve disputes.&nbsp.
Arbitration is similar to litigation, but happens outside the court system, using an arbitrator instead of a judge or jury to resolve the dispute.&nbsp.
Agreement to arbitration is a required condition of your use of the Site.
You and Company agree that if any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Site, the Content, your User Content, these Terms, any of Company’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights, or any Additional Terms (“Dispute”), including questions about whether the Dispute is subject to arbitration, that Dispute shall be resolved according to this Section 11.
You and Company also agree that if the Dispute cannot be resolved informally under Section 11(A), it shall be resolved by binding arbitration before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
(“JAMS”), an independent national arbitration association, in accordance with JAMS’ rules.&nbsp.
Information about JAMS and its rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267.</p>
<p>If there is an arbitration, Company will pay for the arbitrator and the forum.&nbsp;Regardless of whether you or Company initiate the arbitration, Company will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including JAMS’ fees and the fees for the arbitrator’s services.&nbsp;However, Company will not pay and you will be responsible for your attorneys’ fees if you choose to be represented by an attorney.</p>
<p>Company desires a fair process, and the arbitration will meet the standards set by JAMS designed to ensure a fair hearing, including the selection of an independent, neutral arbitrator who has no relationship with Company or its management.
You agree that, notwithstanding any provision in these terms regarding applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted under this Section 11 shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) (9 U.S.
Code §§ 1-16).
This Section 11 can only be amended by mutual agreement.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<u>
<strong>Informal Effort to Resolve Disputes</strong>
</u>.
If a Dispute arises, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution.
Our notice will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.
If we have no contact information for you or if the information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 11(A).
Your notice to us must be sent to: info@homeonlinetips.com.
For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Company and you will communicate to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though nothing requires either you or Company to resolve the Dispute on terms which you and Company, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Binding Arbitration</u>
</strong>.
If we cannot resolve a Dispute informally under Section 11(A) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.<br>
A Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration administered by JAMS, in accordance with JAMS’ then-current Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”).
To start the arbitration process, Company or you will send a written request for arbitration to JAMS at 8401 N.
Central Expressway, Suite 610, Dallas, TX 75225 by U.S.
mail or a reputable overnight delivery service (for example, Federal Express).&nbsp;You must also send a copy of any arbitration request to us at info@homeonlinetips.com&nbsp;so that we are aware of the arbitration and can pay JAMS’ fee.&nbsp;JAMS will select a location for the arbitration, according to its procedural standards, that will be convenient for you.&nbsp;An arbitrator will be selected and govern the process, and he or she will issue a final and binding arbitration award.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Limited Time to File Claims</u>
</strong>.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST INITIATE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
“Initiating” means, as applicable: (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth above in Section 11(A).
or (b) filing for arbitration with JAMS as set forth in Section 11(B).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
The parties expressly waive any contrary statute of limitations or time bars, both legal and equitable, to a Dispute.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Injunctive Relief</u>

ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.
Therefore, you should review the posted terms of service and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Site (at least prior to each transaction or submission).

In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.
You should frequently check the home page, and the email you associated with your purchases for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice.
You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Site and related services.</p>
