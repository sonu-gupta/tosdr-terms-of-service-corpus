<p>The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>
Purchasing process

<ul>
<li>Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.</li>
<li>After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.</li>
</ul> Order submission
<p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
<li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
<li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.</li>
</ul>
<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>

<ul>
<li>either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.</li>
</ul> Methods of payment
<p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
<p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees.
In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of this Website.</p>
<p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services.
Therefore, this Website does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>
<p>If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order.
Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.</p>

<p>Until payment of the total purchase price is received by the Owner, any Products ordered shall not become the User’s property.</p>
Delivery<p>Deliveries are made to the address indicated by the User and in the manner specified in the order summary.</p>
<p>Upon delivery, Users must verify the content of the delivery and report anomalies without undue delay, using the contact details provided in this document or as described in the delivery note.
Users may refuse to accept the parcel if visibly damaged.</p>
<p>Goods are delivered to the countries or territories specified in the relevant section of this Website.</p>
<p>Delivery times are specified on this Website or during the purchasing process.</p>
Failed delivery
<p>The Owner cannot be held responsible for delivery errors due to inaccuracies or incompleteness in the execution of the purchase order by the User, nor for any damages or delays after handover to the carrier if the latter is arranged by the User.</p>
<p>If the goods are not received or collected at the time or within the deadline specified, the goods will be returned to the Owner, who will contact the User to schedule a second delivery attempt or to agree on the future course of action.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed, any delivery attempt starting from the second shall be at the User’s expense.</p> User rightsRight of withdrawal
<p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.
Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>
Who the right of withdrawal applies to
<p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>
<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>
Exercising the right of withdrawal
<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document.
Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.
In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>
<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of goods,</strong> the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day on which the User or a third party – other than the carrier and designated by the User – takes physical possession of the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of several goods ordered together</strong> but delivered separately or in case of purchase of a single good consisting of multiple lots or pieces delivered separately, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day on which the User or a third party – other than the carrier and designated by the User – acquires physical possession of the last good, lot or piece.</p>
</li>
</ul> Effects of withdrawal
<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract.
Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.
In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
…on the purchase of physical goods
<p>Unless the Owner has offered to collect the goods, Users shall send back the goods or hand them over to the Owner, or to a person authorized by the latter to receive the goods, without undue delay and in any event within 14 days from the day on which they communicated their decision to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>The deadline is met if the goods are handed to the carrier, or otherwise returned as indicated above, before the expiration of the 14-days-period for returning the goods.
The reimbursement may be withheld until reception of the goods, or until Users have supplied evidence of having returned the goods, whichever is the earliest.</p>
<p>Users shall only be liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling of the goods outside of that which is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and functioning.</p>
<p>
<strong>The costs of returning the goods are borne by the User</strong>.</p> Legal guarantee of conformity for goods
<p>Under EU law, for a minimum period of 2 years after delivery, traders guarantee the conformity of the goods they sell.
This means that traders must ensure that the goods purchased have the promised quality, or the quality that can be reasonably expected, functionality or characteristics for at least two years after they’ve been delivered to the purchaser.</p>
<p>Where Users qualify as European Consumers, the legal guarantee of conformity for goods applies to the items available on this Website in accordance with the laws of the country of their habitual residence.</p>
<p>National laws of such country may grant such Users broader rights.</p>
<p>Consumers who do not qualify as European may benefit from legal guarantee of conformity rights in accordance with the legislation of the country of their habitual residence.</p> Liability and indemnificationEU UsersIndemnification
