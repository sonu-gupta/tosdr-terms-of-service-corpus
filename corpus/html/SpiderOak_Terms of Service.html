<p>Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) sets out the legal requirements to formally report copyright infringement to a service provider like SpiderOak.
It also explains how the person who posted the content can oppose a notice of alleged infringement by submitting a counter-notice.</p>
<p>Please think carefully before sending us a copyright notice or counter-notice, because the DMCA imposes legal and financial penalties for making fraudulent or bad-faith claims.
If you aren’t sure whether you’re the actual copyright holder or if you’re authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf, check with an attorney before submitting a copyright notice or counter-notice to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>Copyright Infringement Notice Procedure<p>To send us a notice concerning copyright infringement, you’ll need to provide the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf (typing your full name will do);</li>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a copy of or link to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed);</li>
<li>Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on our services (e.g., a URL where the allegedly infringing material is located);</li>
<li>Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;</li>
<li>Date you are sending the notice;</li>
<li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can report alleged copyright infringement by emailing the above information to copyright@spideroak.com.</p>
<p>You can also mail a copyright notice to: Laura Gowans, SpiderOak, Inc., 8216 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, KS 66214, USA.</p>
<p>Our response to notices of alleged copyright infringement may include removing or restricting access to allegedly infringing material.
If we remove or restrict access to content in response to a copyright notice, we’ll make a good-faith effort to get in touch with the affected account holder to provide information about the situation, including a copy of the takedown notice and instructions for filing a counter-notification.</p>
<p>
<em>Copyright Infringement Counter-Notice Procedure</em>.
If you get a message from us about a DMCA complaint, it means that the content identified in the notice has been removed from SpiderOak or access to the content has been restricted.</p>
<p>Please read our message carefully, because it’ll include information about the copyright notice we received and instructions about how to file a counter-notice.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Note</em>
</strong>: If you re-post material removed in response to a DMCA notification, we may permanently suspend your account.
If you believe content was removed in error, please consider filing a counter-notice instead of re-posting the material.</p>
<p>If you receive a DMCA notification about material you’ve posted and you believe that material was misidentified or removed in error, you can file a counter-notice by following the instructions below.</p>
<p>To submit a counter-notice, please send us the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will do);</li>
<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the URL at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the description from the DMCA notice is enough);</li>
<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
and</li>
<li>Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which SpiderOak may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the copyright notification or an agent of such person.</li>
</ol>
<p>To submit a counter-notice, please respond to our original email letting you know about the removal, and include the above information in the body of your reply.</p>
<p>When we receive a valid counter-notice, we’ll promptly forward a copy to the person who sent us the copyright notice.
If we aren’t told within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>Children<p>SpiderOak’s Services are only for users that are either16 years old and older or have attained the age of majority in their jurisdiction.
If we learn an account is registered to a user that is under the age of majority , we’ll terminate the minor’s account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>SpiderOak Groups, Enterprise Backups, SpiderOak CrossClave, and Semaphor<p>You must operate your SpiderOak Services account(s) consistent with any policies your group or employer may require.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>Limitation of Liability<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SPIDEROAK OR ITS AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, COLLATERAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA OR USE DAMAGES) ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF SERVICES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE.
CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES.</p>

SpiderOak reserves the right to assume, at its sole expense, the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in which event you agree to fully cooperate with SpiderOak in asserting any available defenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>Arbitration<p>We like to resolve disputes fairly, quickly, and easily.
Toward that end, if you have any issue with SpiderOak, please contact us and we’ll work with you in good faith to try to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>If we can’t work out the problem informally, and if you are a resident of or have your principal place of business in the United States or Canada, you and SpiderOak agree to resolve any claim against each other through final and binding arbitration, including claims against SpiderOak affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, and SpiderOak affiliates’ officers, directors, employees and agents.</p>
<p>You and SpiderOak agree to submit the dispute to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, or, by separate mutual agreement, to another arbitration institution.
The AAA’s rules and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be held in the Kansas City, Missouri metropolitan area, or any other location both parties agree to in writing.
Allocation of fees and costs shall be determined under the AAA rules, except that SpiderOak will reimburse you for all AAA administrative fees in disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.</p>
<p>The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs all disputes between you and SpiderOak.
The arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.</p>
<p>If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you neither are a resident nor have a principal place of business in the United States or Canada, you agree to resolve any claim you have with SpiderOak exclusively in a state or federal court with jurisdiction over Johnson County, Kansas and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts for purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
<p>Nothing shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>YOUR RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION<p>You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate.
If you do so, neither you nor SpiderOak can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt out, you must notify SpiderOak within 90 days of the date that you first agreed to these Terms.
Send your written opt-out notice to this address: Arbitration Opt-Out, Attn: Laura Gowans, SpiderOak, Inc., 8216 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, KS 66214, USA.</p>
<p>Your written opt-out notice must include (1) your name and residence address.
(2) the email address and/or mobile telephone number associated with your account.
(3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
and (4) your signature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>NO CLASS ACTIONS<p>You may bring disputes only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>Governing Law and Jurisdiction<p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Kansas, except for its conflict of laws principles.</p>
<p>For claims that aren’t subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Johnson County, Kansas or in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>Entire Agreement<p>These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and SpiderOak.
If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>No Waiver<p>No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be a further or continuing waiver of that term.
SpiderOak’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>Modification<p>The Terms may be modified from time to time in our sole discretion.
The date of the most recent revisions will always be at https://spideroak.com/terms-of-service/, and older versions will be archived at spideroak.com.
If we make changes that we believe will substantially alter your rights, we will post the revisions 7 days before they take effect so you can review them.
Any such changes will apply only to users that have accepted the Terms.
You’ll agree to accept any changes or revisions to the Terms by continuing to use SpiderOak’s Services at any time following the effective date of such revision.</p>
