<p>We will also share your personal data with credit-reference agencies (or other providers of credit information) to:</p>

</ul>
<p>When you enter into a credit agreement with us we may continue sharing information with credit reference agencies or other providers of credit information (for example, information about your repayments and whether you repay in full or on time).</p>
<p>The personal data we share with and receive from credit reference agencies (or other providers of credit information) when you apply for, or use, a Revolut credit product will vary depending on the country you live in.
We will provide full details when you apply for a Revolut credit product.</p>
<p>
<strong>For UK users only</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are located in the United Kingdom, we may also check your credit history to help us develop and, in the future, offer credit products that meet the needs of our customers.
This will enable us to pre-filter the credit products that you may be eligible for and, in some cases, let you know before you apply if you will be accepted for a Revolut credit product.</p>
<p>However, if you would prefer that we do not use your data in this way you can use the privacy settings in the Revolut app to opt out.</p>
<p>Credit-reference agencies will not store any of your information that we send them when we use their services for this purpose and these checks do not leave any ‘footprint’ (trace) whatsoever on your credit record held by the credit-reference agency.</p>

<ul>

What are my rights? <strong>Your right</strong>
<strong>What it means</strong> You have the right to be told about how we use your personal data.
We provide this privacy policy to explain how we use your personal data.
If you ask, we will provide a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
We can’t give you any personal data about other people, personal data which is linked to an ongoing criminal or fraud investigation, or personal data which is linked to settlement negotiations with you.
We also won't provide you with any communication we've had with our legal advisers.
You can ask us to correct your personal data if you think it's wrong.
You can have incomplete or inaccurate personal data corrected.
Before we update your file, we may need to check the accuracy of the new personal data you have provided.
You can ask us to delete your personal data.
You can ask us to delete your personal data if: ✓ there's no good reason for us to continue using it.
✓ you gave us consent (permission) to use your personal data and you have now withdrawn that consent.
✓ you have objected to us using your personal data.
✓ we have used your personal data unlawfully.
or ✓ the law requires us to delete your personal data.
Just to let you know, we may not be able to agree to your request.
As a regulated financial services provider, we must keep certain customer personal data even where you ask us to delete it (we've explained this in more detail below).
If you've closed your Revolut account, we may not be able to delete your entire file because these regulatory responsibilities take priority.
We will always let you know if we can't delete your information.
You can object to us processing your personal data for marketing purposes.
You can tell us to stop using your personal data for marketing.
You can object to us processing other personal data (if we are using it for legitimate interests).
If our legal basis for using your personal data is 'legitimate interests' and you disagree with us using it, you can object.
However, if there is an overriding reason why we need to use your personal data, we will not accept your request.
If you object to us using personal data which we need in order to provide our services, we may need to close your account as we won’t be able to provide the services.
You can ask us to restrict how we use your personal data.
You can ask us to suspend using your personal data if: ✓ you want us to investigate whether it is accurate.
✓ our use of your personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to delete it.
✓ we no longer need the information, but you want us to continue holding it for you in connection with a legal claim.
or ✓ you have objected to us using your personal data (see above), but we need to check whether we have an overriding reason to use it.
You can ask us to transfer personal data to you.
If we can, and are allowed to do so under regulatory requirements, we will provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
You can withdraw your permission.
If you have given us any consent we need to use your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time by changing your privacy settings in the Revolut app or sending an email to dpo@revolut.com.
(Note, it will have been lawful for us to use the personal data up to the point you withdraw your permission).
You can ask us to carry out a human review of an automated decision we make about you.
If we make an automated decision about you that significantly affects you, you can ask us to carry out a manual review of this decision.
<p>Your ability to exercise these rights will depend on a number of factors.
Sometimes, we will not be able to agree to your request (for example, if we have a legitimate reason for not doing so or the right does not apply to the particular information we hold about you).
</p>
10.
How do I exercise my rights?
<p>To exercise any of your rights set out in the previous section, you can contact us through the Revolut app or send us an email at dpo@revolut.com.</p>
<p>For security reasons, we can't deal with your request if we are not sure of your identity, so we may ask you for proof of your ID.</p>
<p>Revolut will usually not charge you a fee when you exercise your rights.
However, we are allowed by law to charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on your request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive.</p>
<p>If you are unhappy with how we have handled your personal data you can complain to your local data protection authority.
In the United Kingdom, this is the ICO (website).
In the EU, there are national and regional data protection authorities (a list is available on this website).</p>
11.
Do you share my personal data with anyone else?
Revolut group companies
<p>We share your personal data within the Revolut group of companies in order to provide you with the best service.</p>
Other Revolut customers
<p>We will ask you to let us sync your mobile phone contacts.
This will help you to identify which of your trusted mobile phone contacts are Revolut customers.
Your ‘trusted contacts’ will also be able to see if you are a Revolut customer through our ‘Payment with Friends’ functionality.</p>
<p>‘Payment with Friends’ gives you access to Revolut features like requesting money from your friends, splitting bills, group vaults and paying other Revolut customers near you.</p>
<p>We use technological safeguards to ensure a ‘trusted contact’ is somebody you already know and who knows you (for example, you have each other saved in each other’s mobile phone contacts lists or have already received or given money through a peer-to-peer payment with them).</p>
<p>Both you and your trusted contact must have synced your mobile phone contacts lists with Revolut to be viewable to each other in the Revolut app.</p>
<p>We only show your basic contact details in the Revolut app to your trusted contacts who are also Revolut customers (for example, your name (as saved in your friend’s contacts list), mobile phone number, Revolut username, your Revolut profile photo (if you have one)).
</p>
<p>You can, of course, choose not to sync your contacts list with Revolut.
This means that you will not be able to identify which of your mobile phone contacts are Revolut customers.</p>
<p>You can also turn off ‘Payments with Friends’ through the privacy settings in the Revolut app.
</p>
People or companies that you transfer money to
<p>Where you make a payment from your Revolut account, we will provide the recipient with your details (for example, your full legal name and IBAN).</p>

<p>We may share your personal data with our partners in order to provide you with certain services you have asked us for (for example, when we offer overseas medical insurance as part of our Premium or Metal plans).</p>
<p>If you are a Revolut Business customer, we may share your personal data with our partners (through the Revolut Business API) when you switch this function on through Revolut Connect.</p> Here's an example of when we might share your personal data with our partners
<p>If you have asked for insurance services, we will share your relevant personal data with the provider of our insurance services.
The service provider will require your personal data to provide you with insurance.</p>
<p>We will only share your personal data in this way if you have asked for the relevant service or it is provided as part of one of our plans.
</p>
<p>From time to time we may work with other partners to offer you co-branded services or promotional offers, and we will share some of your personal data with those partners.
We will always make sure you understand how we and our partners process your personal data for these purposes.
</p>
<p>Our partners will have their own privacy policies explaining how they use your personal data.
It's important that you read those privacy policies as well.
For example, our third party insurance provider, White Horse Ireland dac, will process your personal data in accordance with its own privacy policy.</p>
Credit-reference agencies
<p>As set out in the Do you carry out credit checks about me? section, if you apply for a credit product, we'll share your personal data with
credit-reference agencies to check whether you are likely to make repayments when due.</p>
Other financial institutions
<p>We may share your personal data with other financial institutions if requested.
</p> Here's an example of when we might share your personal data with other financial institutions
<p>If you have activated ‘Open Banking’ through an account you hold with another financial institution and given them permission, we will share data from your Revolut account with that financial institution.
</p>
<p>We may also share your personal data with other financial institutions where you do not ask us to.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you make an outbound payment, we share information about you alongside your payment.
This is because we, like all payment institutions, are required by law to include certain information with payments.
and</li>
<li>if a payment is made to your account by mistake, we can share your information with the financial institution the payment came from.
This will help the payer and the other financial institution to try and get the payment back themselves.</li>
</ul>
For legal reasons
<p>We also share your personal data with fraud-prevention agencies to check your identity, protect against fraud, keep to anti-money laundering laws and confirm that you are eligible to use our products and services.</p> Here's an example of when we might share your personal data for legal reasons
<p>If you give us false or inaccurate personal data and we identify fraud, we will let fraud-prevention agencies know.
Law-enforcement agencies may check and use this personal data.</p>
<p>If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance or employment.
You can contact us through the Revolut app to ask us for details of the fraud-prevention agencies we may share your personal data with.</p>
<p>We may also need to share your personal data with other third party organisations:</p>
<ul>
<li>if we have to do so under any law or regulation.
</li>
<li>if we sell our business;</li>
<li>in connection with criminal or fraud investigations.
</li>
<li>to enforce our rights (and those of customers or others).
or</li>
<li>in connection with legal claims.
</li>
</ul>
Social media and advertising companies Here's an example of when we might share your personal data for advertising purposes
<p>We may share your personal data (your name, email address and app events) with our advertising partners in the ways described below, but the personal data is hashed before we send it, and the social-media platform we share it with is only allowed to use that hashed personal data in the ways described below.</p>
<p>When we use social media for marketing purposes, your personal data may be shared with the social-media platforms so that they can check if you also hold an account with them.
If you do, we may ask the advertising partner or social-media provider to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use your personal data to send our adverts to you, because we think that you might be interested in a new Revolut product or service.
</li>
<li>not send you our adverts, because the marketing relates to a service that you already use.
or</li>
<li>send our adverts to people who have a similar profile to you (for example, if one of our services is particularly useful to people with similar interests to the ones on your social-media profile, we may ask our advertising partner or social-media partner to send our adverts for that service to those people).
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of how we may use social media for marketing purposes is through Facebook’s ‘Custom Audience’ tool, the terms of which are available here.</p>
<p>Our legal basis is:</p>
<ul>
<li>legitimate interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can contact us at any time, either through the Revolut app or by emailing dpo@revolut.com, if you do not want us to share your personal data for advertising purposes.
You can also use the privacy settings in the Revolut app to opt out from having your personal data shared in this way.</p>
<p>Remember you can also manage your marketing preferences directly with any social media provider that you have an account with.</p>
Where you ask us to share your personal data
<p>Where you direct us to share your personal data with a third party, we may do so.
For example, you may authorise third parties to act on your behalf (such as a lawyer, accountant or family member or guardian under a power of attorney).</p> Revolut and your personal data

Will my information go outside of the United Kingdom or Europe?
<p>As we provide an international service, we may need to transfer your personal data outside the United Kingdom or European Economic Area (EEA) in order for us to provide our services.</p>
<p>For example, if you ask to make an international payment, we will send funds to banks outside of the United Kingdom or EEA.
We might also send your personal data outside of the United Kingdom or EEA to keep to global legal and regulatory requirements, and to provide ongoing support services.</p>
<p>We may share your personal data with credit-reference agencies and fraud-prevention agencies that are based outside of the United Kingdom or EEA.
</p>
<p>We will take all reasonable steps to make sure that your personal data is handled securely and in line with this privacy policy and data protection laws.</p>
<p>If you would like more information, please contact us through the Revolut app or by sending an email to dpo@revolut.com.

How do you protect my personal data?
<p>We recognise the importance of protecting and managing your personal data.
Any personal data we process will be treated with the utmost care and security.
This section sets out some of the security measures we have in place.
</p>
<p>We use a variety of physical and technical measures to keep your personal data safe and prevent unauthorised access to, or use or disclosure of it.
Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems with control over access to information using both physical and electronic means.
Our staff receives data protection and information security training.
We have detailed security and data protection policies which staff are required to follow when they handle your personal data.</p>
<p>While we take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data will be kept secure from unauthorised access, we cannot guarantee it will be secure during transmission by you to our app, a website or other services.
We use HTTPS (HTTP Secure), where the communication protocol is encrypted through Transport Layer Security for secure communication over networks, for all our app, web and payment-processing services.</p>
<p>If you use a password for the Revolut app or our website, you will need to keep this password confidential.
Please do not share it with anyone.</p>
<p>When you use our services, which includes our social network accounts and the Revolut Community forum, do not share any personal data that you don't want to be seen, collected or used by other customers, as this personal data will become publicly available.</p>
14.
How long will you keep my personal data for?
<p>We will generally keep your personal data for six years after our business relationship with you ends or such period as may be required by applicable local laws.
However, if you receive services from our Lithuanian group companies, Revolut Bank UAB or Revolut Payments UAB, we will keep your personal data for eight years after our business relationship with you ends.
</p>
<p>We are required to keep your personal data for this long by anti-money laundering and e-money laws.
We may keep your personal data for longer because of a potential or ongoing court claim or another legal reason.</p>
15.
How will you keep me updated on how you use my personal data?
<p>If we change the way we use your personal data, we will update this policy and, if appropriate, let you know by email, through the Revolut app or through our website.</p>
