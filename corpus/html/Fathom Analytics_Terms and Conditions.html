If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Website.</p> Subscriptions <p>The Services are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription") per our pricing, which can be found by visiting usefathom.com/pricing (“Fees”).
You will be billed the Fees in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle").
Billing Cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew unless you or we cancel it pursuant to these Terms.
You may cancel your Subscription’s auto-renewal through your online account management page on the Website.
Cancellation occurs immediately.</p>

You shall provide us with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, and valid payment method information.
By submitting such payment information, you irrevocably authorize us to charge the applicable Fees for your Subscription and your use of our Services, in accordance with the applicable Billing Cycle, to that payment method.</p>
<p>You are responsible to ensure that all the Fees payable by you are paid on a timely basis.

A “pageview” is a website view or an event completion.
If you exceed your prescribed pageview limit for 2 consecutive months, or you significantly exceed your pageview limit within the first month, as determined by us in our sole discretion, we will notify you asking you to upgrade your account.

<li>We are not liable for any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively, “Losses”) arising out of or relating to your customers’ use of the Website or our Services and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, service providers, contractors, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against all such Losses.</li>

<p>We take the protection of personal data very seriously, and it was the foundation on which Fathom Analytics was built.
Our Services shall not be used to track personal data, such as full name, email address, mailing address, etc.
If we detect that you are intentionally using Fathom Analytics for tracking of personal data, we may terminate your account without warning.</p> Termination <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
Upon termination, your right to use the Services will immediately cease.</p>
<p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may delete your account within the Settings area of your dashboard once you have logged in.
We will then queue up all of your sites (and their data) for deletion, so you must ensure you’ve downloaded your data backup to your computer BEFORE you delete/cancel your account.
Once your account has been deleted, it cannot be recovered.</p> Limitation Of Liability <p>EXCEPT WHERE SUCH EXCLUSIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL THE COMPANY NOR ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, CONTRACTORS, LICENSORS, LICENSEES, SUPPLIERS, OR SUCCESSORS BE LIABLE FOR NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION, FUNDAMENTAL BREACH, DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF PRIVACY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY WAS ALLEGEDLY ADVISED OR HAD REASON TO KNOW, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, OR RELIANCE ON, THE WEBSITE, ITS CONTENT, ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS FOUND OR ATTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE, ANY INFORMATION YOU INTENTIONALLY OR INADVERTENTLY PROVIDE US (OTHER THAN THE IP ADDRESS AND USER AGENT STRING), ANY LINKED WEBSITES OR SUCH OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES, NOR ANY WEBSITE CONTENT, MATERIALS, POSTING, OR INFORMATION THEREON EVEN IF THE PARTY WAS ALLEGEDLY ADVISED OR HAD REASON TO KNOW.</p> Disclaimer <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, ITS CONTENT, AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS FOUND OR ATTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
