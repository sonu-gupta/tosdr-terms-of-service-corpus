DISPUTES—ARBITRATION <p> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MEDIALAB.
</p>
<p>
<b>Any dispute, claim, or cause of action arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms, the Services, or Service Materials (we call these “Disputes”), shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court, except as otherwise stated herein.
You and MediaLab each waive your respective rights to a jury trial for Disputes.</b> This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
</p>
<p> As an exception to the arbitration requirement, the following disputes may be brought in court: (i) any dispute that seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property (such as copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents) may be brought in court.
(ii) any claim of interference or attempted interference with our Services.
and (iii) disputes regarding the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.
In addition, either party may assert the Dispute in small claims court if the Dispute qualifies.
</p>
<p>
<b>You and MediaLab agree that Disputes are personal and therefore, class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted.</b> Neither you nor MediaLab will commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding that would affect other users of the Services.
The arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
</p>
<p> Any arbitration under this provision shall be held in Los Angeles, California (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before and in accordance with the applicable rules of JAMS, which are available on the JAMS website.
You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
Arbitrations shall be conducted in English.
All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.
</p>
<p> As limited by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms, and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any individual Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court (excluding class arbitrations or representative actions as noted above).
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
</p>
<p> You and MediaLab agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises before filing for arbitration.
Notice to MediaLab must be sent to law@medialab.la.
If the Dispute is not resolved informally between the parties within thirty (30) days of the date of notice, then either party may initiate arbitration in accordance with these Terms.
</p>
<p> Any Dispute must be filed within eighteen months after it arose.
otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Opt-Out of Arbitration:</i>
</b> You have the right within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms to decline this agreement to arbitrate.
To do so, you must send written notice with your name, address, username, email address or phone number that you use for your Service account, identify the Service(s) you use, and clearly state that you want to opt out of the Terms of Service arbitration agreement.
Send this notice to: 1222 6th St., Santa Monica, CA 90401.
</p>
<p> If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding after providing MediaLab the required notice, MediaLab will pay the filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees if the arbitration seeks less than US $10,000 and the Dispute is not determined to be frivolous or improper by the arbitrator.
We will also pay the fees and costs for any arbitration that we initiate.
For all other Disputes, the fees and costs shall be paid according to the JAMS rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
</p> 16.
APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE <p> These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California without resort to its conflict of law provisions.
To the extent the arbitration requirement does not apply (if ever), you agree that any action at law or in equity for any Dispute shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding for any Dispute.
</p> 17.
TERMINATION <p> Section 5 of these Terms have described specific instances in which MediaLab will automatically terminate a User’s account for specified violations, such as for repeat infringement.
In addition, MediaLab reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services and/or Service Materials at any time and to block or prevent your future access to, and use of, the Services and/or Service Materials, for any or no reason.
MediaLab also has the right to remove prohibited User Content at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.
</p> 18.
SEVERABILITY <p> If any provision, or part thereof, in these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then the unenforceable provision or part thereof, shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of the provision and any remaining provisions in these Terms.
</p> 19.

If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you may delete your account(s).
</p> 20.
FORCE MAJEURE <p> Neither party will be liable for failure or delay in performing its obligations because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God, terrorism, war, riots, fire, natural disasters, outbreaks or pandemics, or degradation or failure of third party networks or communications infrastructure.
</p> 21.

You cannot assign your account without our written consent.
We may assign or delegate our rights and obligations in whole or in part without your consent.
