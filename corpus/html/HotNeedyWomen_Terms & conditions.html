Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:<ul>
<li>Your UGC.
All of your UGC either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms.
Your UGC should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.
Do not use any UGC that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own.
this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.
If anyone contributes to your UGC or has any rights to your UGC, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the UGC, then you must also have their permission to submit such UGC to White Mountain Online Solutions B.V..
(For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to White Mountain Online Solutions B.V.
as your UGC, then you must obtain your friend’s and the photographer’s permission to do so.)</li>
<li>Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.
If you choose to submit photos to the Service or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.</li>
<li>Act Appropriately.
All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.
Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.
If you think your UGC might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn’t belong on the Service.
Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.
Your UGC must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or handicap.

</li>
<li>Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.
Your UGC must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.<br>
</li>
<li>Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your UGC.

In the event you receive anything in consideration from us with respect to your UGC (e.g., coupons, sweepstakes entries, etc.) you represent you will include disclosure of the receipt of this consideration clearly and conspicuously as part of the UGC and include any other disclosures we may require.<br>
</li>
<li>Others Can See.
We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.
However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and UGC that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.
Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on the Communities and take care when otherwise disclosing this type of information to others.<br>
</li>
<li>Don’t Share Other People’s Personal Information.
Your UGC should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, email address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by White Mountain Online Solutions B.V.
(e.g., an email address to send an email invite to a friend).<br>
</li>
<li>Don’t Damage the Service or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices.
Your UGC must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.<br>
</li>
</ul>If you submit UGC that White Mountain Online Solutions B.V.
reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.
However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by applicable law.
We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.
Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the UGC in question being removed from the Service.<br>
<br>(ii)	Your Interactions With Other Users.
Disputes.
You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline.
We do not conduct any background or criminal record check or other investigation of users, some of which may be sex offenders, fraudsters or otherwise unsavory and may intend you harm.
