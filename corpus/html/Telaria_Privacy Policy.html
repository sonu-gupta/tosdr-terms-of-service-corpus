</ul> Privacy Policy Last updated: December 22, 2020
<strong>This privacy policy describes how Telaria, Inc.
and its affiliates (Telaria, we, us, or our) collects, uses, and shares information through both its video advertising services, including our video management platform, as well as the Telaria website, Telaria.com, and other Telaria digital properties and products that link to this privacy policy (Telaria Site or Site).&nbsp;For information regarding Outstream Services, please visit here.</strong>
<strong>A.
Telaria </strong>
<strong>Video management platform </strong>
<p>Telaria operates a self-service software platform that helps our publisher clients (i.e., content owners or other sellers of video advertising inventory, including websites and apps) analyze, manage and monetize their video advertising inventory on internet connected devices and platforms, including mobile devices, computers and connected TVs.
This section of our privacy policy explains how our platform collects, receives, uses, and shares information in providing services to our clients.</p>
<strong>Information we</strong>
<strong> collect </strong>
<strong>or receive</strong>
<p>We work with publishers as instructed by them to analyze, manage and monetize their video advertising inventory.&nbsp.
This video advertising inventory is made available to advertisers, agencies and other media buying platforms, which we collectively refer to as advertisers.&nbsp.
When an advertiser successfully purchases and serves an advertisement to a publisher’s advertising inventory, the video advertisement will be displayed to you in connection with the content that you view.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we receive certain information from the websites and apps where videos are displayed, pass that information to advertisers, and vice-versa.
The information we receive may include IP address, location-related data, mobile application data, the web page URL or app in which an individual is viewing a video, video player size, the video title, description, or category being displayed, the date and time of video display, browser or device type, a cookie or device identifier, and other data which the publisher chooses to provide to us.</p>
<p>We may also receive information from third parties at the instruction or for the benefit of our clients, in particular data management platforms and services (either through a publisher or through a relationship that we have directly established) that provide user demographics and information with respect to a users’ preferences, patterns, click and video interactions, behaviors or interests, as well as advertisers and advertising platforms that provide information to us in order to match an ad opportunity offered by our clients with the right advertisement.</p>
<p>Once we deliver that advertisement, we may receive information about how you interact with that advertisement, such as how long you view it and whether you click through to visit the advertiser.</p>

A cookie is a small piece of text data that is stored by your browser.
Cookies are commonly assigned by online services, such as websites or ad technologies, to recognize a computer or device that they have encountered before.
A device identifier is an alphanumeric identifier generated by the operating system for use in advertising purposes, and it functions in a manner similar to cookies in web browsers.

To do so, Telaria performs a cookie syncing between the client’s cookies, a cookie Telaria uses for its client’s benefit and the advertiser’s cookies.
Telaria also uses a cookie for frequency capping, i.e., to ensure that the same user is not served the same advertisement repeatedly.</p>
<p>As your primary touchpoint, publishers (i.e., the website or application on which you are viewing content) should generally provide mechanisms to ensure, where applicable, that you consent to the cookies and similar technologies set out above.
