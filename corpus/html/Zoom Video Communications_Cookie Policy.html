</ul> Cookie Policy <p>Updated: January 1, 2020</p>
<p>Zoom Video Communications, Inc.
(“Zoom”) and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer and track users’ movements during your visit to our website or use of our Products, and gather information about you, where you access our website or Products, how you use our Products and services, and to provide you with information about Zoom Products you might be interested in buying.
</p>
<p>What are Cookies and Does Zoom Use Them?</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites and services that you visit or access.
They are widely used to make websites and services work and function with greater efficiency, and to provide information about our users’ experience during use of, or interaction with, our websites, Products, services and advertisements.
Some cookies last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you exit your browser.
other cookies may last for longer than your web session, including after you exit your browser, for example by remembering you when you return to our website.
The table below explains the cookies that Zoom and our third party partners use and why.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Cookie</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Type</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Purpose</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>Required Cookies&nbsp;</p>
<p>Core</p>
<p>These cookies are required to enable basic site functionality such as providing a secure login and remembering your progress through an order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>Zoom uses performance cookies for load balancing to ensure that websites and Products remain up and operating.</p>
<p>Functional Cookies</p>
<p>Preferences and Settings</p>
<p>These cookies are used to record a user’s choice and settings that enable our websites and Products to operate correctly or that maintain your preferences over time and may be stored on your device.
For example, Zoom saves preferences, such as language, browser and multimedia player settings, which enables the browser to remember these setting each time you return to the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in and Authentication</p>
<p>When you sign into a website or Product using your Zoom account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device.
This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the website without having to sign in again on each page.
You can also save your sign-in information, so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.</p>
<p>Analytics</p>
<p>To provide our products and improve your user experience on our websites and with our Products, Zoom uses cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data.
For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to our blog and to develop other statistics about the operations of our Products.
This includes cookies from Zoom and from third-party analytics providers.
We use the information to compile reports and to help us improve our websites and Products.</p>
<p>Advertising Cookies</p>
<p>Interest-Based Advertising</p>
<p>Zoom uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you.
You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Zoom as described in the How to Control Cookies section of this cookie policy and in our Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
Users who opt out of the “sale” of their personal information won’t receive interest-based advertising from us on their device.
Note: If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device.</p>
<p>Social Media Cookies</p>
<p>Some of our websites and Products include code snippets provided by social media companies that can sense if you are already logged into a given social media account so you can easily share Zoom content with other social media users via that account.
These code snippets read cookies set previously by social media company web content while you are logged in and browsing such content on those social media sites.</p>
<p>Social media companies will not be able to sense if you are already logged into a given social media account if you&nbsp.
turn off Advertising Cookies.
Note: If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device.</p>
<p>We embed videos from Zoom's YouTube channel using YouTube’s privacy-enhanced mode.
This mode may set cookies on your computer once you click on the YouTube video player.
YouTube will not store personally-identifiable cookie information for playbacks of embedded videos if you turn off Advertising Cookies.
.</p>
<p>How to Control Cookies</p>
<p>You can turn Advertising Cookies and Functional Cookies off at any time by visiting our Cookie Preferences link at the footer of the page.</p>
<p>
You can also control cookies by adjusting the settings within your internet browser.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them.
For example, in most modern browsers, you can block or delete cookies by clicking Settings &gt.
