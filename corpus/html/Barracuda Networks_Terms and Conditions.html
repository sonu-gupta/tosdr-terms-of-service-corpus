<u>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</u>
</strong>
<strong> .
IF CUSTOMER LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS SECTION CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
IT AFFECTS CUSTOMER’S RIGHTS REGARDING HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE CUSTOMER MAY HAVE WITH BARRACUDA.
PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
</strong>
</p>
<p> The parties will attempt to resolve any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) against Barracuda, its agents, employees, successors, assigns or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this paragraph, “Barracuda”) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Barracuda Materials, Barracuda advertising, or any related purchase (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”) through face to face negotiation with persons fully authorized to resolve the Dispute or through mediation utilizing a mutually agreeable mediator, rather than through litigation.
If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation within a reasonable time after written notice from one party to the other that a Dispute exists, the Dispute will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration.
The Arbitration will be conducted before one (1) independent and impartial arbitrator.
The arbitration hearing shall take place in Cupertino, California and will be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act to the exclusion of any inconsistent state laws.
The arbitrator shall base his or her award on the terms of this Agreement and will follow the law and judicial precedents that a United States District Court Judge sitting in the county of Santa Clara, California would apply to the Dispute.
The arbitrator shall render his or her award in writing and will include the findings of fact and conclusion of law upon which his or her award is based.
Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
The existence, content and results of any negotiation, mediation or arbitration will be treated as confidential.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party will have the right to obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other equitable relief to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm, although the merits of the underlying Dispute will be resolved in accordance with this paragraph.
</p>
<p> THE PARTIES AGREE TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PERMIT CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.
THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
