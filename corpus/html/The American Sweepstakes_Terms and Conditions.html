§ 227 et seq.
or the California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal.
Penal Code § 630 et seq.
Unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not preside over any form of a consolidated, class, or representative proceeding or otherwise consolidate or join claims from more than one person or party.
The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief, including monetary, and declaratory relief, only in favor of the individual party seeking such relief and only to such extent as may be necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).
No relief awarded shall affect our other users.
</p> Arbitration Procedures <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or this Agreement is void or voidable.
</p>
<p> The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.
The AAA’s rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at http://www.adr.org.
</p>
<p> The arbitration shall be held in the county of your residence or at another location mutually agreed by both parties.
If the value of the relief sought is less than or equal to $10,000, either party may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions and such election shall be binding on both parties subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to necessitate an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.
Unless the arbitrator requires otherwise, either party may attend an in-person hearing by telephone.
</p>
<p> The arbitrator shall determine the substance of all claims in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of Missouri, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.

Where the value of the relief sought is over $10,000 and you are successful in demonstrating that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of Arbitration Costs as may be deemed necessary by the arbitrator to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
If the arbitrator determines your claim(s) in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree that you will be liable to reimburse us for all the Arbitration Costs paid by us on your behalf, which you otherwise would be required to pay under the AAA’s rules.

Where an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provision(s) in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (i.e.
