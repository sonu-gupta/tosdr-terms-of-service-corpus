We use our own ePrivacy Compliant Analytics service.</em>
</p> Whom we share your personal data with <p>To run our business efficiently and securely, we sometimes will have to share your personal data with other (trusted) parties such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Data processors</strong>: providers of various services that process your personal data on our behalf</li>
<li>
<strong>Our accountant</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Professional advisors from other industries</strong>, such as law and finance</li>
<li>
<strong>IT support, when necessary</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Public authorities</strong>: when we are obliged to report to them</li>
</ul>
<p>We require that all such recipients secure data in accordance with good information security and as per the requirements of this Privacy notice.
We review and quality assure all vendors and data processors and enter into a data processing agreement/addendum whenever necessary.</p>
<p>We use data processors for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email, calendar and digital meetings</li>
<li>Accounting/bookkeeping</li>
<li>This website, including online payments providers</li>
<li>Transactional emails to customers</li>
<li>Support ticket system</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't publish further details (like names) of our data processors to protect our business.
If you'd like to know more about our processing and with whom we share your personal data, please get in touch with us.
We practice data minimization, so we will only use data suppliers to process your personal data when required (e.g.
Stripe for payment processing).</p> Transfer of personal data outside the EU/EEA <p>In some cases, your personal data will be transferred to a "third country", i.e.
outside the EU/EEA.
For example, where we use data processors to manage email services.
We only use data processors we trust that are well known, reputable, and have a data processing agreement/addendum.</p>
<p>We have ensured that every data processor in a third country has necessary safeguards in place like the EU adequacy decision, standard contractual clauses (SCC) or binding corporate rules (BCR).</p>
<p>We conduct risk assessments for every data processor we use in our business.
In addition, where your personal data is transferred outside of the EU/EEA, we conduct an additional risk assessment.
We review, in particular, the data processor's technical and organizational security measures, reputation and safeguards for international transfers of personal data.</p>
<p>In line with the Schrems II ruling and the EDPB's recommendations, we have also conducted transfer impact assessments (TIA).
Finally, we're currently working on a new technique called EU Isolation to address the ruling.
We'll update this privacy notice as soon as we have more information.</p>
<p>If you still have any concerns or questions, please get in touch with us.</p> Information security <p>We take information security as seriously as privacy, and we will always do our utmost to safeguard your personal data in the best possible way.
For example, we use strong passwords, data encryption, two-factor authentication and several other measures to secure our data and prevent unauthorized persons from accessing, altering, deleting, or in any way affecting the data we store, <em>including</em> your personal data.</p>
<p>We only allow others to access or process your personal data in accordance with our instructions and only when strictly necessary (e.g.
in the unlikely event that we require IT support).</p>
<p>We have created and implemented a dedicated IT security policy for technical and organizational measures and a routine for managing data breaches.
Suppose we experience a personal data breach, i.e.
a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data, and it poses a medium to high risk for the people affected.
In that case, we will notify the national data authority within 72 hours.
If the risk is deemed high for the people affected, we will inform them directly, if possible.</p> Our role as a data processor <p>When you use Fathom Analytics on your website, we process data from your website visitors on your behalf.
In this case, you are the controller of such data, and we are a data processor of yours.
We comply with the requirements as per GDPR Article 28, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only carry our processing on your behalf and as per your instructions</li>
<li>Use sufficient technical and organizational security measures to protect the data we process on your behalf</li>
<li>Require our employees to treat your data as confidential</li>
<li>Govern this processing by a contract (a data processing addendum) [DPA being published publicly soon]</li>
</ul>
<p>We also engage other (sub)processors as per your general written authorization and will inform you of any intended changes regarding such (sub)processors to object to such changes, should you not agree to them.</p>
<p>You can view a detailed Data journey of what happens when you use Fathom analytics on your website.
And you can explore our privacy law compliance section for more information.</p> We process minimal personal data on your behalf <p>Since we built Fathom Analytics from the ground up with privacy in mind, we have minimized the amount of personal data being processed to only include the IP address and User-Agent (in line with one of the fundamental principles of the GDPR.
Article 5(1)(c)).</p>
<p>The IP address and User-Agent are considered personal data under the GDPR, and the lawful basis for processing is usually consent or legitimate interest.
Since the IP address is provided by the internet service provider and not by the user's <em>terminal equipment</em>, we do not consider such information to constitute "information stored in the terminal equipment".
IP addresses provided in that manner are therefore outside the scope of Article 5 (3), and the consent requirement will not apply under the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2009/136/EC).
In addition, User-Agent is not accessed from <em>terminal equipment</em>, it is sent to us by your browser, and it's impossible for us not to receive it.
Note: This may change in the future as browsers move to remove user agent strings.</p>
<p>As per the Schrems II ruling, we are currently working out how we process data in the EU.
This will be available on our website shortly, and this privacy notice will then reflect this change.</p> Accessing and Correcting your Personal Data <p>You have a right to access your personal data and request a correction if you believe it is inaccurate.
If you have submitted Personal Information and would like to have access to it, or if you would like to have it corrected, please get in touch with us using the contact information provided below.</p> How to Contact Us <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or to access your information, please send a written request to:</p>
