However, we have elected to give Users the opportunity to submit a Counter-Notification to help us resolve issues regarding claims concerning copyright and intellectual property ownership.
Receipt of a Counter-Notification does not bind Ruboss to any legal obligations, and our intention is for the Counter-Notification to be used only for the purposes of our internal deliberations.
Unless we are obliged to do so through a legal process, we will not release the information in the Counter-Notification to the Claimant or the Claimant’s representative or representatives.</p>
<p>If you elect to send us a Counter-Notification (for example, in the event that, in response to a notice of its infringement, we have taken down or disabled access to material that you have contributed to the Site), to be effective it must be a written communication provided to our Agent for Notice that includes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name and address of the claimed owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest (the “Counter-Claimant”);</li>
<li>An electronic or physical signature of the Counter-Claimant, or the person authorized to act on their behalf;</li>
<li>Identification of the material that is subject to the Claimant’s Notification of Infringement, including a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property subject to the claim of infringement;</li>
<li>A description of where the alleged infringing material is (or was, if we have disabled access to it) located on the Site, including at least one Internet address, and with enough detail that we may find it on the Site;</li>
