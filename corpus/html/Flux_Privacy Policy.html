<p>This document discusses how Flux utilizes information collected on any web service provided on a flux.community URL that links to this policy (hereafter “Websites”).</p>
Types of information we collect
<p>Personal information (“Personal Information”) is generally defined as information that, by itself or in combination with other information, could be used to identify you, could be reasonably associated with you, or information that may be used to get access to your account.
Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, name, mailing and/or shipping address(es), telephone number, email address, username and password, credit/debit card number and other financial information, Internet protocol (“IP”) address and other online identifiers, date of birth, location data, race, professional or employment-related information, political affiliation, office address and other business information, biometric data (e.g., fingerprints), government-issued identification numbers (e.g., social security number.

<p>Personal Information and other data is gathered on or through the Websites in two ways: (1) indirectly (for example, when information is automatically collected through our Websites’ technology).
and (2) directly (for example, when you voluntarily provide information on various pages of the Websites).</p>
<p>One example of data we collect indirectly is through internet access logs.
When you access the Websites, your numeric IP address is automatically collected and is placed in our internet access logs.</p>
<p>We collect data indirectly from you in a number of ways, one of which is through the use of browser cookies.
A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to the web browser, which enables the web server to collect information from the browser.</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies.
We’ve designed the Websites so that if you are just interested in reading or listening, you will be able to do so.
However, switching off cookies may restrict your use of the Websites and/or delay or affect the way in which the Websites operate, particularly interactive features.</p>

There are areas on our Websites where you may be asked to provide Flux with Personal Information such as your name, mailing and/or shipping address(es), email address, telephone number, date of birth, and/or credit/debit card number or other purchasing information when we provide you with the opportunity to utilize interactive feature such as:</p>
