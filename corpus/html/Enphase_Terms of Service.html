</strong>
<strong>:</strong> To maintain the stability of the electricity system and support the continued installation of rooftop solar, the WA State Government is introducing Emergency Solar Management.
This is the capability to remotely turn off (and on again) new/upgraded residential rooftop solar systems with an inverter capacity of 5kW or less.
This can be achieved in two ways – API cloud solution or metering solution.
By using Enphase Products as part of your system, and to the extent that the Remote Connectivity standards apply, you agree to make your system available to Synergy for the purposes of Emergency Solar Management.
Homeowners are responsible for ensuring that their systems can be remotely managed, in line with the terms of their DEBS agreement with Synergy.
Households should discuss the emergency solar management requirements with their chosen solar installer and can also find more information at https://www.synergy.net.au/global/dpv-management .</p>
