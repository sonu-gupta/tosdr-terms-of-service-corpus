To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with your Account, which includes, without limitation, applicable tax information.
If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your payments until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax information.
Any bank fees related to returned or cancelled checks due to a contact or payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment.

Topics not explicitly addressed in this DWU Policy are addressed in our Terms of Service and supporting policies.
In the event of a conflict between this DWU Policy and our Terms of Service or supporting policies, the DWU Policy shall govern with respect to your use of the Service as a DWU Partner.</p>The Drive With Uber Program<p>Getaround’s Drive With Uber Program (the “Program”) is provided by Getaround to eligible Uber driver-partners so they may reserve vehicles to provide passenger transportation services or food delivery services to third parties while using the apps sourced by Uber Technologies, Inc.
or its subsidiaries (collectively, “Uber”).
An individual’s participation in the Program is subject to initial and ongoing approval by both Getaround and Uber (as further described below).</p>DWU Partner Eligibility Requirements<p>To be eligible for participation in the Service as a DWU Partner, you must meet all of the following requirements (collectively, the “Partner Eligibility Requirements”):<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>You must be at least 21 years old.</li>
<li>You must have a valid U.S.

</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the Partner Eligibility Requirements are prerequisites to initial and ongoing eligibility as a DWU Partner, and not a guarantee of such eligibility.
The Partner Eligibility Requirements are separate from (and supplemental to) any requirements by Uber regarding use of its app, in addition to any requirements set by Uber for you to accept requests from third parties for transportation services using the Uber app.</p>Insurance<p>The source of the auto liability insurance coverage provided in connection with the Program depends on whether you’re available or waiting for a ride request, en route to pick up riders, or on an active trip with such riders.
In the event you are involved in an accident while using the Getaround Service to participate in the Program, please contact both Getaround and Uber about the accident as soon as possible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Damage Fee discussed in our Insurance Policy applies at all times during your use of the Service to participate in the Program.</p>Compliance With Applicable Laws<p>In addition to meeting the Partner Eligibility Requirements, you acknowledge and agree that at all times, you shall hold and maintain all licenses, permits, approvals and authority applicable to you that are necessary to operate DWU-Eligible Cars (defined below) as part of your participation in the Program.
You acknowledge and agree that you may be subject to certain driving record checks and other forms of background checks, such as criminal record checks, from time to time in order to participate in the Program and use the Service.
You acknowledge and agree that Getaround reserves the right, at any time in Getaround’s sole discretion, to deactivate or otherwise restrict you from accessing the Service if you fail to meet the requirements set forth in this DWU Policy.</p>Proper Care and Reservation ProceduresDWU Trips with DWU-Eligible Cars<p>Certain cars in the Service have been made available for use in the Program (collectively, “DWU-Eligible Cars”).
DWU Partners using the Service to participate in the Program may only reserve DWU-Eligible Cars to do so.
DWU-Eligible Cars are visible to DWU Partners by accessing the “Drive With Uber” section of the Getaround Software.
DWU Partners may not reserve non-DWU-Eligible Cars to participate in the Program.</p>Program Use Only<p>DWU-Eligible Cars may be used only to participate in the Program (“Program Use”).
They may not be used for any purpose besides participation in the Program, including without limitation the following:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Provision of passenger transportation services or food delivery services to third parties using an app other than the Uber apps;</li>
<li>Personal use beyond that which is strictly related to the provision of passenger transportation services pursuant to the Program.
or</li>
<li>Usage that violates any applicable laws, regulations, ordinances or the like.</li>
</ul>
<p>DWU Partners who incur mileage in DWU-Eligible Cars that is not strictly related to Program Use will be charged the Mileage Fee as specified in Getaround's Fee and Commission Schedule.</p>Trip Price<p>The total price you will be charged for your use of a DWU-Eligible Car (the “Trip Price”) consists of: 1) the initial reservation price.
2) the cost of any trip extensions.
and 3) any Standard Fees applicable to the initial reservation or trip extensions.
The initial reservation price, and the cost of any trip extensions, are based solely on the DWU-Eligible Car being used for the Program.
The Trip Price is charged when the initial reservation for that trip (the “DWU Trip”) is made, or when extensions for that trip have been applied.
Earnings received while driving with Uber have no bearing on the Trip Price.</p>Trip Parking<p>The parking spots occupied by DWU-Eligible Cars at their designated parking locations are reserved solely for DWU-Eligible Cars.
Non-DWU-Eligible Cars may never occupy any parking spot reserved for Program Use, regardless of how long the occupancy lasts or the duration of any DWU Trip.
The foregoing restriction includes (without limitation) the parking of DWU Partners’ personal cars in spots reserved for Program Use.
Non-DWU-Eligible Cars occupying such parking spots will be removed at their owners’ expense, which may include towing, storage, and citation fees related to such removal.</p>Trip Extensions<p>Notwithstanding any communications or statements to the contrary, a DWU-Eligible Car may only be accessed, unlocked, used, driven, or otherwise operated (collectively, “Operated”) by the DWU Partner who has reserved such DWU-Eligible Car, and only for so long as such DWU Partner’s payment method can be successfully charged for the Trip Price of the DWU Trip (including any trip extensions).
Any attempted or actual Operation of a DWU-Eligible Car in violation of the foregoing, or contrary to Program Use, regardless of whether a Return Request (defined below) has been submitted, will result in: 1) prevention of such DWU Partner’s further Operation of the DWU-Eligible Car, with such DWU Partner responsible for all towing, impound, storage, citation, and recovery costs and fees necessary to ensure such prevention.
and 2) permanent termination of such DWU Partner’s Account with the Service.
To the extent that any claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arise from your violation of this section (collectively, “Claims”), you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Getaround and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors harmless from such Claims.</p>DWU Weekly Trips<p>Certain DWU-Eligible Cars may be initially reserved in week-long increments.
Such cars are referred to herein as Weekly Eligible Cars.
DWU Trips reserved in week-long increments are referred to as DWU Weekly Trips.
The minimum length or duration of a DWU Weekly Trip is 7 consecutive calendar days (the “DWU Weekly Trip Minimum”).
The maximum length or duration of a DWU Weekly Trip is 28 consecutive calendar days, including the day on which the DWU Weekly Trip started (the “DWU Weekly Trip Maximum”).<br>
</p>
<p>Once a DWU Weekly Trip has commenced, it cannot be converted into a standard (hourly) DWU Trip.
DWU Weekly Trips may only be extended in specific, predetermined increments, and only until the DWU Weekly Trip Maximum has been reached.
Subject to applicable Return Requests (defined below), DWU Weekly Trips are not eligible for refunds or promotional credits attributable to unused time.<br>
</p>
<p>The DWU Weekly Trip Maximum shall include: 1) any trip extensions applied to the initial reservation as the result of a DWU Partner’s continued Operation of a Weekly Eligible Car.
and 2) any time period during which a Weekly Eligible Car has not yet been returned to its designated parking location, even if a trip extension has not been applied to such time period.
Provided that a DWU Weekly Trip has not exceeded the DWU Weekly Trip Maximum, trip extensions may be applied to such DWU Weekly Trip (either by you or by Getaround, as necessary) until such DWU Weekly Trip Maximum has been reached or the Weekly Eligible Car has been returned to its designated parking location (as described in the profile of the Weekly Eligible Car), whichever occurs earlier.<br>
</p>
<p>Once the DWU Weekly Trip Maximum has been reached, if the Weekly Eligible Car has not been returned to its designated parking location, the DWU Partner who is Operating the Weekly Eligible Car pursuant to such DWU Weekly Trip must immediately return the Weekly Eligible Car to its designated parking location, regardless of any trip extensions applied or automated notifications sent by Getaround.
Failure to observe the requirements of this section will result in immediate and permanent termination of such DWU Partner’s Account with the Service.
Nothing in this section should be construed so as to allow a DWU Partner to Operate a DWU-Eligible Car or Weekly Eligible Car if such DWU Partner’s payment method has not been successfully charged for the Trip Price of the DWU Trip or DWU Weekly Trip, as applicable, regardless of whether the DWU Weekly Trip Maximum has been reached.<br>
</p>
<p>While a DWU Weekly Trip is in progress, the Weekly Eligible Car being Operated pursuant to such trip may not remain parked at its designated parking location for any length of time.
If such Weekly Eligible Car is parked at its designated parking location during a DWU Weekly Trip, it will be deemed to have been returned by its DWU Partner, and Getaround may end the DWU Weekly Trip in question.<br>
</p>
<p>The distinctions in this section between DWU-Eligible Cars and Weekly Eligible Cars, and DWU Trips and DWU Weekly Trips, are made solely for the purposes of this section.
All other references to DWU-Eligible Cars or DWU Trips in this DWU Policy shall be understood to include Weekly Eligible Cars and DWU Weekly Trips, respectively.</p>Return of DWU-Eligible Cars<p>From time to time, as required by vehicle safety and repairs, to fulfill the provisions of this DWU Policy and our Terms of Service, or to otherwise comply with applicable laws, Getaround may, in its sole discretion, request the return of a DWU-Eligible Car to its designated parking location (each, a “Return Request”) before the DWU Trip in such car is scheduled to be completed.
Return Requests may be made by oral or written communication.
You acknowledge and agree that your immediate and complete cooperation with such Return Requests is required under this DWU Policy, regardless of the nature of the Return Request, the location of the DWU-Eligible Car when the Return Request is made, or the length or duration of the DWU Trip in question.
A Return Request is deemed received upon delivery by Getaround.
Upon receipt of a Return Request, you shall, as soon as practicable, return the DWU-Eligible Car to its designated parking location in accordance with this DWU Policy and our Guest Policy.<br>
</p>
<p>You may request a promotional credit equal to the cost of the portion of the DWU Trip unable to be completed because of a Return Request, provided that: 1) you have strictly complied with the Return Request, and 2) you did not cause or contribute to the Return Request, in whole or in part.
An example of causing or contributing to a Return Request includes (but would not be limited to) Operation of a DWU-Eligible Car in violation of the Trip Extensions section, above, Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to require Getaround to submit Return Requests to ensure the timely, scheduled return of DWU-Eligible Cars at the completion of DWU Trips.<br>
</p>
<p>DWU Partners shall not be issued any promotional credits or refunds in exchange for the early return of a DWU-Eligible Car that has not been returned pursuant to a Return Request.
DWU-Eligible Cars that are returned before their scheduled trip end time cannot be unlocked, accessed, or otherwise Operated by DWU Partners once they have been returned.</p>Fuel<p>DWU-Eligible Cars must be returned with a full tank of gas at the end of each DWU Trip, notwithstanding the fact that the tank may not have been full when you picked up the car.
DWU Partners who purchase more fuel than they used during a DWU Trip will receive a refund from their Trip Price equivalent to the cost of the excess fuel purchased (the “Fuel Refund”).
The Fuel Refund is calculated by comparing the amount of fuel present at the start of your DWU Trip, the amount of fuel remaining at the end of your DWU Trip, and the cost of fuel as reflected in the average market fuel price.
If the refund amount for a DWU Trip exceeds the initial reservation price for that trip, the DWU Partner will receive a Fuel Refund up to the amount of the initial reservation price, and a Getaround promotional code equal to the excess of the fuel cost over the initial reservation price.<br>
</p>
<p>DWU Partners who fail to return DWU-Eligible Cars with a full tank of gas will be charged for the amount of gas not refilled (the “Fuel Charge”) in accordance with our Fee and Commission Schedule.
The Fuel Charge is calculated based on how much fuel is determined to have been used but not refilled during your DWU Trip, the capacity of the fuel tank of the DWU-Eligible Car you reserved, and the cost of fuel as reflected in the average market fuel price.</p>Tolls<p>All DWU-Eligible Cars are registered with Getaround Autotoll, which is a video-based tolling system that automatically detects when you pass through a toll plaza or electronically tolled lane.
You understand and agree that your payment method on file with the Service will be automatically charged for the price of each toll you incur, along with a $1.50 processing fee for each such toll, as specified in our Fee and Commission Schedule.<br>
</p>
<p>Tolls and processing fees are charged independently of the timing or amount of any corresponding reimbursements provided to DWU Partners.
You understand and acknowledge that charges and processing fees for a given toll may be charged up to 90 days after the date on which the underlying toll was incurred.</p>Displays<p>DWU-Eligible Cars may come equipped with third-party electronic displays ("Displays") that display advertisements promoted by third parties.
The Displays are permanently affixed to the DWU-Eligible Cars and are considered integral components of those cars.
They may not be damaged, defaced, obstructed, covered, unplugged, or otherwise tampered with.
Any damage or loss that occurs to a Display in connection with a DWU Trip or DWU Weekly Trip is subject to the provisions contained in the Damage Fee section of our Insurance Policy.</p>Account Maintenance<p>The “Getaround Accounts” section of our Terms of Service specifies the terms pursuant to which you are required to open and maintain an Account with Getaround to use the Service.
