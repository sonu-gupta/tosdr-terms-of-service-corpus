Our Services' Storage SystemYour Personal Data is stored centrally and securely in our Services' private, dedicated server cluster, located in the New York Metro Area of the United States.
Your Personal Data is not transferred and stored outside this environment, nor is it stored with a distributed cloud-based hosting platform.
Because we maintain our own private server infrastructure, we have full control over the security and replication of your Personal Data.<br>
<br>7.1.
Data ReplicationWe replicate your Personal Data for backup purposes, in the event that our servers or hard disks fail, or in the event that through human error your Personal Data is deleted.
Typically, we maintain 3 copies of your Personal Data on our Backup Server.
Our Backup Server is located within our private server infrastructure as mentioned above, and is never transferred outside to a separate hosting environment.<br>
<br>7.2.

To remove your Personal Data from public display on Our Services, please refer to <i>
<b>Sharing Choices</b>
</i> above.<br>
<br>7.3.

These measures include:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Physical Barriers - our private server infrastructure is physically guarded 24/7.</li>
<li>Firewalls - our servers only communicate to one another in specific ways, between specific origins and destinations.</li>
<li>Network monitoring - we monitor for attacks on Our Services, and protect our Members' accounts by notifying them of suspicious activity.</li>

</ul>
<br>Personal Data Anonymization involves severing or scrambling the link between your Personal Data and you as a natural person.
