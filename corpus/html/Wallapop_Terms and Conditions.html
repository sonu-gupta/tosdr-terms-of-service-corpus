Wallapop Shipping</strong>
</p>
<p>Wallapop makes use of a courier service, that operates via Correos in order to deliver items purchased within the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the purchase process, the user can use this shipping service for their deliveries.
It is essential the whole transaction is carried out via the Wallapop chat and that the purchase is made in the wallapop app.</p>
<p>Mangopay is a platform that allows secure payments between Users via the internet, providing both the buyer and seller have registered with Mangopay and accepted the terms and conditions of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Mangopay, property of Leetchi Corp, company based in 14 rue Aldringen, L-1118, Luxemburgo).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wallapop informs their Users that they do not offer electronic payment systems nor do they act as an intermediary in such payments.
Hence, Users who use the Mangopay platform enter into a contract with Mangopay with respect to their payment services and terms and conditions, of which wallapop forms no part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, any claim or dispute that is raised in relation to the services supplied by Mangopay must be made directly to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For security reasons, Mangopay may require the user to supply identification in order to process a transaction.
This request, will be made when the total amount of the transactions made reaches or exceeds 1000 (one thousand) euros in sales or 2500 (two thousand five hundred) euros in purchases.
Or, when a request is made by the platform (generally due to the detection of unusual activity for the payment method in question).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This document will be required by our Customer Service team who will manage the request with Mangopay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have chosen the delivery service, the app will send a tracking number to both the buyer and the seller, so that the item can be located at all times.
The buyer will receive the item to the address supplied at the time of payment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
