        Privacy policyData collected by Bibliogram<p>Bibliogram logs all incoming request URLs and the time of the request
to the console, but does not log headers, IP addresses, or other
information.
These logs are not stored on disk.</p>
<p>Bibliogram has a database that stores the usernames and IDs of
viewed users, and all data about viewed posts.
This data is not
linked with the user that requested it.
</p>Data collected by Caddy<p>This server uses caddy as a reverse proxy to Bibliogram.
Caddy logs nothing
by default, and this setting is not altered, so no information is logged.
</p>Sending data<p>Data collected by Bibliogram is not public and is never sent
to any external services.
</p>Exporting or deleting your data<p>Since Bibliogram does not associate any data with a user
identifier, we cannot export or delete "your" data since we have
no concept of "you".
