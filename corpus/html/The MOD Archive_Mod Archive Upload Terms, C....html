<b>Section 4: Footnotes</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> 4.1 Works in the public domain.
Materials that have previously been distributed under public domain license (for example, PD Disk Distributors) are quite legal to upload to our servers as long as the material has not been modified from its original state since release.
Any works submitted to The Mod Archive that are not uploaded by their creators or copyright holders are assumed to be released into the public domain prior to upload and therefore legally licensed for redistribution as Public Domain material by The Mod Archive.
Materials that have been uploaded but have been modified since origin are submitted entirely at the uploaders own risk, where all liabilities remain with the uploader concerning any legal implications that arise from subsequent litigation should there be any incident where a party has cause to complain.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> 4.2 Footnote disclaimer.
Should any section of the footnoted contradict the previous paragraphs in sections 1-3 inclusive, the paragraphs in sections 1-3 inclusive take precedence.<br>
</li>
</ul>
