<br> 1105 Media Cookie Policy <p>
<i>
<b> Effective January 1, 2021</b>
</i>
</p> Cookies and IP Addresses
<p>1105 Media uses industry standard cookie technology (examples below) in order to maximize customer experience and operational efficiency.&nbsp.
When you visit one of 1105 Media's websites, we may send you a cookie.
A cookie is a small file which is placed on your computer or device.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.
Essential Cookies</b>
<br> These cookies are essential for the operation of our websites.
Without the use of these cookies, parts of our websites would not function.
For example, we use cookies to help us identify which of our readers have previously registered in order to access premium content on our websites.</p>
<p>
<b>2.
Analytical Performance Cookies</b>
<br> We use these types of cookies to monitor our websites' performance and how users may interact with it.
These cookies provide us with information that helps us provide better products to our users and also to identify any areas that may need maintenance.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.
Functional Cookies</b>
<br> Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our websites.
An example would be saving your "handle" name to be used when submitting comments on our websites.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.
Behavioral Advertising Cookies/Third Party Cookies</b>
<br> We use cookies to provide tailored advertising which we believe is relevant to you.
Additionally, some of our partners use cookies on our sites in order to provide tailored advertising to you when you subsequently visit sites outside of our network.</p>
<p>Online behavioral advertising is a way of providing advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to your interests.
This is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous web browsing activity.
Advertising is then displayed to you when you visit a website that matches these interests.</p>
<p>Behavioral advertising is based upon your web browsing activity over a period of time – so it's different than advertising you may see when you're looking for something online using a search engine (e.g., Google) or on the website you may be visiting at a particular time.
As an example, you may be doing research on products and services related to data Centre virtualization.
If a data Centre virtualization provider is conducting an advertising campaign on our network, as you browse the relevant portions of our sites, we may serve you with one of the advertisements of one of their solutions.</p> We may also track IP addresses.
An IP address is a number that can identify an Internet Service Provider and country location.
It cannot provide personal information.<p>
</p>How to control the use of cookies
<p> You are not obliged to accept cookies and may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies.
The browser you use to surf the web not only allows you to see the cookies that you have got but also allows you to control their use.</p>
<p>
</p>You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or deleting all of them.
You can also set your browser to not accept cookies altogether.
If this option is selected, you should be aware that many websites will not function properly or at all.
It may be possible to set your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your consent before each cookie is set on your device.
This gives you control over what is set on your device, however, it may slow down your browsing experience.<p>
</p> You may also opt out or change your behavioral advertising cookie preferences by visiting the opt-out page for the Digital Advertising Alliance (U.S.
residents and those not in the EU or Canada), the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EU residents), or the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (Canadian residents).<p> There are different levels of control too.
You are able to prevent just third-party cookies being deployed, effectively opting out of third party behavioral advertising, and some browsers even allow you to block specific companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all companies.</p>
