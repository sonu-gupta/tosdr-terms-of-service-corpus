&nbsp;Booking a Seat when carpooling<p>
</p>
<p>When a Passenger is interested in an Advert, he may make an online booking request.
This booking request is either (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when posting his Advert), or (ii) accepted manually by the Driver.
At the time of the booking, the Passenger makes the online payment of the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees, where applicable.
After receipt of the payment by BlaBlaCar and validation of the booking request by the Driver, where applicable, the Passenger receives a booking confirmation (the “<strong>Booking Confirmation</strong>”).</p>
<p>If you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the bookings requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to any booking request within the given timeframe.
Otherwise, the booking request will expire automatically and the Passenger shall be refunded all sums paid at the time of the booking request, if any.</p>
<p>At the time of the Booking Confirmation, BlaBlaCar will send you the telephone number of the Driver (if you are the Passenger) or of the Passenger (if you are the Driver).
You are then solely responsible for executing the contract binding you to the other Member.</p>
<p>Any use of the Services, in the capacity of Passenger or Driver, relates to a specific name.
The Driver and the Passenger must correspond to the identity communicated to BlaBlaCar and the other Members participating in the Trip.</p>
<p>However, BlaBlaCar allows its Members to book one or more Seats on behalf of a third party.
In this case, you undertake to accurately indicate to the Driver, at the time of the booking, the forenames, age and telephone number of the person on whose behalf you are reserving a Seat.
It is strictly prohibited to book a Seat for a minor under the age of 13 travelling alone.
In the case where you are reserving a seat for a minor over the age of 13 travelling alone, you undertake to request the prior agreement of the Driver and to provide him with duly completed and signed permission of his/her legal representatives.</p>
<p>In addition, the Platform is intended for the booking of Seats for individuals.
It is forbidden to book a Seat for transporting any object, package, animal traveling alone or material items whatsoever.</p>

&nbsp;Cost Contribution when carpooling<p>
</p>
<p>The Cost Contribution is determined by you, as Driver, under your sole responsibility.
It is strictly prohibited to profit in any way from using our Platform.
Consequently, you agree to limit the Cost Contribution you ask your Passengers to pay to the costs you actually incur to make the Trip.

This amount is given purely as a guideline and it is up to you to increase it or reduce it to take account of the costs you actually incur on the Trip.
To avoid abuse, BlaBlaCar limits the possibility of adjustment of the Cost Contribution.</p>
<p>
</p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp.
&nbsp;Service Fees<p>
</p>
<p>At the time of booking of a Trip or a bus ticket, BlaBlaCar may collect service fees (hereinafter referred to as the “Service Fees”) calculated on the basis of the Cost Contribution or the price of the bus ticket.
The methods of calculation of the Service Fees in force can be found here and are for information purposes only.
BlaBlaCar reserves the right to change the methods of calculation.
Any modification does not affect the Service Fees of Trips and bus tickets already booked.</p>
<p>The Service Fees are collected by BlaBlaCar for each Seat subject of a booking by a Passenger.</p>
<p>In the case of cross-border journeys, please note that the methods of calculation of the amount of the Service Fees and the applicable VAT vary according to the residence of the Passenger.</p>
<p>When using the Platform for cross-border trips or out of the United Kingdom, the Service Fees may be charged by an affiliate company of BlaBlaCar operating the local platform.</p>
<p>
</p>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp.
&nbsp;Rounding<p>

&nbsp;<strong>Payment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver</strong>
</p>

In the absence of claim of the Passengers within this period, BlaBlaCar shall consider the Trip confirmed.</p>
<p>From the time of this express or tacit confirmation, you shall have, as Driver, a credit payable on your Account.
This credit corresponds to the total amount paid by the Passenger at the time of confirmation of the Booking reduced by the Service Fees, i.e.
the Cost Contribution paid by the Passenger.</p>
<p>When the Trip is confirmed by the Passenger, you have the option, as a Driver, of giving instructions to BlaBlaCar to pay the money to your bank account (by entering your bank details in advance in your Account) or your PayPal account (by entering your PayPal email address in advance in your Account).</p>
<p>The payment order in your name will be sent on the first working day after your request or, if you do not so request, the first working day after&nbsp;the provision of the sums in question to your profile (providing BlaBlaCar has your bank information).</p>

<p>As Driver, you agree not to request a Cost Contribution higher than the costs you actually incur and that may generate a profit, being specified that in the context of a cost sharing, you have to bear as a Driver your own part of the costs induced by the Trip.
You are solely responsible for calculating the costs you incur for the Trip and for checking that the amount requested of your Passengers does not exceed the costs you actually incur (excluding your share of the costs).</p>
<p>BlaBlaCar reserves the right to suspend your Account in the case where you use a chauffeur-driven or other business vehicle or taxi, or a company car, and due to this, generate a profit from the Platform.

<p>BlaBlaCar also reserves the right to suspend your Account, limit your access to the Services, or terminate these T&amp;Cs, in the case of activity by you on the Platform which, owing to the nature of the Trips offered, their frequency, the number of Passengers carried and the Cost Contribution requested, entails a situation of profit for you, or for any reason suggesting to BlaBlaCar that you are generating a profit on the Platform.</p>
