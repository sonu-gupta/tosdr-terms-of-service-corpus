Exclusion of liability
<p>All information is provided without obligation.
we do not guarantee that each and every part of it is always fully up to date.
We reserve the right to amend or update information on this website at any time and without prior notice.
This also applies to improvements and/or modifications to the products or software described on this website.
This website may contain technical inaccuracies and/or typographical errors.<br>
Similarly, we accept no liability for technical problems related to the website and its availability (connection difficulties, website availability, etc.), damage caused by third parties, malware of all kinds (viruses, worms, Trojan horses, etc.), and we do not guarantee the perfect functioning of hardware and software while viewing this website.</p>
<p>Certain links on this website lead to third-party websites.
These links are made available for informational purposes only.
We have not verified the websites that are linked to and we are not responsible for their content.
the use of these links is at your sole risk.
We recommend that you read the legal statements and data protection provisions of the respective websites and check how these websites protect your personal data, and also how any third party affiliated to a linked website protects your personal data.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances will Punkt Tronics AG or its directors, contractors, associates, appointees or other representatives be liable to you or to any third parties for any interruption of operation of your information systems, for the loss of programs or data, or for any other direct, indirect, special or other consequential damage, that result from the use of this or of a linked website.
This continues to apply even if specific reference is made to the possibility of such damage.</p>
Information technology security
<p>Please be aware of the danger arising from viruses or other malicious software (malware) or hacking attacks, phishing and the like.
We recommend that you use anti-virus software, anti-spam filters, a firewall and other methods to protect your system and that you take care to keep them up to date.
We are excluded from any responsibility for any manipulation made to your computer system by unauthorized persons in relation to access to our website.
&nbsp.
Phishing refers to malicious attempts to access confidential data, and it may come in various ways, including email, telephone, SMS text message or fax.
Any request to disclose payment card data (e.g.
card number, expiry date) or any other sensitive information should be seen as a possible phishing attempt.
These requests can often appear extremely realistic.
If there are any grounds for doubt, do not respond, do not not click on any link within an email, and do not open any attachments that may be included.
Suspicious emails or SMS text messages should be deleted immediately, and excluded/removed from any backups.
If you are in doubt about the genuineness of a request for sensitive information, contact us by telephone for confirmation on +41 91 924 9003.</p>
Data transmission security
<p>Please note that data transmitted via an open network such as the Internet or an email service is visible to anyone.
We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of messages or documents that are transmitted by these means.
Any time that you communicate personal information through an open network, you should be aware that third parties can potentially access this information and use it without your consent.
Third parties can therefore detect debit/credit card activity or other business relationships.
&nbsp.
Even if the sender and the recipient are located in the same country, the transmission of data via electronic networks will inevitably have security vulnerabilities.
also, the transmission may be via other countries, including countries that do not offer the same level of data protection as Switzerland.
Your data may be lost, or stolen by unauthorised third parties, during transmission.
We will not be liable for the security of your data during electronic transmission and we decline any responsibility for direct or indirect damage.
Please use other means of communication if you consider it necessary or reasonable for security reasons.
