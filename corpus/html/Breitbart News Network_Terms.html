<ul>
<li>a physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive copyright that is allegedly infringed;</li>

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to BREITBART a counter-notice.
All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.</p>
<p>Notice of claims of copyright infringement can be made as follows:</p>
<p>
<strong>Designated Agent:</strong> Webmaster<br>
<strong>Address of Agent:</strong> 149 S.

<ul>
<li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
<li>identification of the User Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the User Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
<li>a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the User Content.
and</li>
<li>your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Los Angeles, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Counter-notice of claims of copyright infringement can be sent to:</p>
<p>
<strong>Designated Agent:</strong> Webmaster<br>
<strong>Address of Agent:</strong> 149 S.
Barrington Ave., #735, Los Angeles, CA 90049<br>
<strong>Email for notice:</strong> copyright@breitbart.com</p>
<p>If a counter-notice is received, you agree that BREITBART may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.
Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at BREITBART’s sole discretion.
You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
