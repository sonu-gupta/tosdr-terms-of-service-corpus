We also ask you to create a password to keep your account secure.<br>
<br>
<b>Service delivery </b> – To enable you to use our Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution.
Operating a VPN solution entails that we process your IP address at a minimum in order to effectively reroute traffic through the servers that can deliver optimal performance of the service.

<p>– To improve our service and generate insight for future products/services.
The analytics platforms we leverage to monitor website traffic require basic device information to operate effectively such as IP address, device ID and type.

<b>Payment processing </b> – To make available the facility for settling payment transactions.
You can subscribe to use our VPN solution while taking advantage of the two payment options we provide, namely, the in-app purchasing gateways provided by both Google and Apple, and the payment platform operated by Stripe.
