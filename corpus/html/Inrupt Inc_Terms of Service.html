</p>
<p>
<i>Warranty Disclaimer</i>
<i>.</i> Inrupt and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (Inrupt and all such parties together, the “Inrupt Parties”) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the Inrupt Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services.
The Inrupt Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services.
THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY INRUPT (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<i>Limitation of Liability</i>.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE INRUPT PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ($250) DOLLARS OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<i>Indemnity</i>.
You agree to indemnify and hold the Inrupt Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to your violation of these Terms.
In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>
<p>
<i>Assignment</i>.
You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Inrupt's prior written consent.
We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>
<p>
<i>Choice of Law</i>.
These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Arbitration Agreement</i>
</b>
<i>.
</i>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Inrupt and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Inrupt.
Both you and Inrupt acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Inrupt's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>
<p>
<i>(a) Arbitration Rules.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</i>.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.
If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.
The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.
The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) <i>Costs of Arbitration</i>.
The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Inrupt will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.
Inrupt will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) <i>Small Claims Court.
Infringement</i>.
Either you or Inrupt may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts or any United States county where you live or work.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) <i>Waiver of Jury Trial</i>.
YOU AND INRUPT WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
You and Inrupt are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
In any litigation between you and Inrupt over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND INRUPT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<p>(e) <i>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</i>.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Inrupt is entitled to arbitration.
instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<b>&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>(f) <i>Opt-out</i>.
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Inrupt Inc., c/o Gunderson Dettmer, One Marina Park Drive, Suite 900, Boston MA 02210&nbsp;postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.
You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>(g) <i>Exclusive Venue</i>.
If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Inrupt to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Inrupt agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, or the federal district in which that county falls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(h) <i>Severability</i>.
If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Inrupt.</p>
<p>
<i>Miscellaneous</i>.
You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Inrupt may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.
The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
You and Inrupt agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Inrupt, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Inrupt, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Inrupt in any respect whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and Inrupt agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p> &nbsp;Solid<ul>
