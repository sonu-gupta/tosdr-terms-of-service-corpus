<em>Updated June 1, 2021</em>
</p>
<p>It is important for you to know the Privacy Policy (the "Policy") of Ducks Unlimited, Inc.
("DU") before interacting with DU, including using any feature of www.ducks.org or any of its affiliated sites, apps and platforms including social media (collectively, the "Web Site").
DU takes your privacy seriously and wants you to know what information is being collected and how it may be used, stored and shared by DU.
By using the Web Site or otherwise providing Personal Information (defined below), you indicate your consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Policy.
Please take a few minutes to read this Policy.
</p>
<p>The Policy does not cover information collected on outside websites linked to the Web Site.
You should carefully check each website to learn its privacy policy because that website's policy may significantly differ from DU's Policy.
DU is not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or content of other websites you may visit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
Collection and use of personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>DU collects information that may be used to identify an individual ("Personal Information") from individuals who use the Web Site, including but not limited to the following information:
</p>
<p>The user's name, address, phone number and e-mail address.
the user's DU membership number.
tracking information about which pages users access and utilize.
information volunteered by the user, such as survey information.
social media profile information, including pictures and IDs.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>If you provide credit card information to DU, the credit card information will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided.
DU does not store credit card information.
</p>
<p>DU collects Personal Information over the Web Sites, but also over the phone, in email, through face-to-face conversation, via mail, chat forums, surveys, donation forms, and registration at events.
DU also contracts with third parties to provide information on individuals that may be interested in information about DU, including our conservation work and potential donors.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>If you do not provide the Personal Information, DU may be unable to provide you with personal and optimized digital experience you desire out of DU.
If you disclose Personal Information to DU about other individuals, you represent that you have the authority to do so.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>DU uses the Personal Information to conduct legitimate business functions, including providing you with relevant content that you may be interested in.
That may include information on our conservation services, membership information, promotions, invitations to events, donor information, and general business information.
DU may also use your Personal Information to respond to questions from you, manage DU's own business and otherwise comply with legal obligations.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>DU will also use the Personal Information to provide specialized and personalized content that DU thinks you might be interested in.
Sometimes, our promotions, sweepstakes or other promotions have specific rules.
Please read those rules carefully.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>DU may also use the Personal Information to respond to requests from government authorities, law enforcement or for other legal reasons.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>If you would like DU to not share your Personal Information with third parties for the purpose of renting or exchanging its mailing list, if you would like to opt-out of receiving mail from DU, or if you would like to opt out of telemarketing, you may call 1-800-45-DUCKS or 901-758-3825 or email&nbsp;privacy@ducks.org.&nbsp.

<p>DU (or its service providers) may use the information we collect (for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers) to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices.
If you wish to opt out of cross-device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your device settings.
We may also use cross-device targeting to help identify our users and service advertising.
This type of advertising is often called "interest-based" or "personalized" advertising – and when it occurs on mobile apps, "cross-app" advertising.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising by visiting (1) the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-out link (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or (2) the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-out link (http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN).
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Setting Page.
Please note that, even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements from us.
However, in that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests.
Also, DU does not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.
</p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of receiving e-mails, you should use the "unsubscribe" feature at the bottom of all DU emails.
</p>
<p>If you would like to access, modify or delete your Personal Information, you may do so to the extent this right is provided by law.
Please contact us at 1-800-45-DUCKS or 901-758-3825 or email privacy@ducks.org&nbsp;to make such a request.
We may need to verify your identify before providing access to, modifying or deleting any Personal Information.
If you request deletion, DU will keep Personal Information until any transactions currently in process are complete, and then only to the extent necessary to implement your request.&nbsp.
