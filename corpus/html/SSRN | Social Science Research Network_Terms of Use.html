Content may not be illegal, obscene, defamatory, threatening, infringing of intellectual property rights, invasive of privacy or otherwise injurious or objectionable.

Accordingly, you may only post versions of academic papers or articles (“Academic Papers”), journal articles, or other content on SSRN if you have the right to do so.
By way of example, while many journal publishers permit posting of some versions of Academic Papers, most journals restrict the sharing of final versions.
To be sure you have the right to upload such content, you should review your publishing agreement, the publisher’s copyright policies, and/or any other applicable information prior to posting any version of an Academic Paper.
You may post your paper to SSRN only if you are the copyright owner, have the copyright owner’s permission, are permitted to do so under your publishing agreement or the publisher’s copyright policies or your institution’s license agreement or under a Creative Commons license.</p> License to Elsevier <p>Users grant to Elsevier (and those we work with) a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, revocable license to perform the Services.
