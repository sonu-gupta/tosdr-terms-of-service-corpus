</ul> Refund Policy <strong>Cancellation, Replacement and Refund Policy</strong>
<p> At PrettyLitter, we want to make sure that you are 100% satisfied with our products.
</p>
<p> The following policy applies to any order cancellations, replacements or refunds, as applicable.
</p>
<strong>CANCELLATIONS</strong>
<p>Cancellation by Customer</p>
<p> Orders may be cancelled only if a cancellation is requested prior to your confirmation of the applicable order.
After your confirmation, the order will be processed and shipped to the address you specify.
</p>
<p>Cancellation by PrettyLitter</p>
<p> In the event a product is out of stock, has errors in pricing or of any unforeseen discrepancy, orders may not be processed and you will be notified.
PrettyLitter reserves the right to cancel any order for any reason with notification of the customer, including the right to cancel any order due to perceived or confirmed misuse, abuse or manipulation of any of PrettyLitter’s cancellation, replacement and return policy or process.
</p>
<strong>REPLACEMENT AND REFUND POLICY</strong>
<p> PrettyLitter will accept a request to replace an order after the product has been delivered to the customer if the product is received in a damaged state.
</p>
<p> PrettyLitter is an advanced innovative&nbsp;litter that requires the reading of instructions and correct&nbsp;usage to be effective.
Instructions on how to use PrettyLitter&nbsp;can be found on the bag itself and&nbsp;in our FAQs.
&nbsp;PrettyLitter will not refund orders based on incorrect usage of the product or a cat not acclimating to a new litter.
Most cats will accept a new litter outright and the small rest typically&nbsp;require a transition through the mixing of old litter and new litter.
&nbsp;Tips can be found in our FAQs.
</p>
<p> Risk-Free Offer is for first-time US customers of PrettyLitter’s non-clumping litter only and is limited to one offer per household.

You will be required to ship back any remaining unopened product within 7 days of the refund request.
PrettyLitter will provide a shipping label for your return upon refund request.
Your order will be refunded to the payment method used for purchase within 7 business days of receiving your return.
