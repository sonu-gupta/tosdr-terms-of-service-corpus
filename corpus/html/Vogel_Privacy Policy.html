<p>Vogel App: The mobile Vogel application, available for Android and iOS operating systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vogel Server: The Vogel server application, running on Amazon Web Services cloud, communicates securely with the Vogel application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vogel Service: The discrete service Vogel can perform on behalf of the user (e.g.
tighten Facebook privacy settings).</p>
</li>
</ul>Summary<p>How Vogel works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A user downloads and uses the Vogel app on their device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user requests the Vogel app to conduct one or more tasks on their behalf (e.g.
tighten Facebook privacy settings).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vogel app requests the user for information (e.g.
their Facebook username and password) to complete the tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vogel app uses the information to complete the tasks either on the user device itself or sends the information to the Vogel server securely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vogel app and Vogel server discard the user information after the task is completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we provide more detail with respect to the data collection.</p>

Answers to security questions (verification questions)</p>
<p>Why do we collect this information?</p>
<p>Vogel helps users:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tighten their privacy settings on social media (e.g.
Facebook)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete personal data collected by Internet companies (e.g.
Google), and by gadgets (e.g.
Amazon Alexa)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opt-out of personal information sales by data brokers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up and manage credit file locks/freezes with the major credit bureaus</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform these tasks, Vogel needs to use the personal data listed above.</p>
<p>What do we do with this information?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authenticate the user and make setting changes (e.g.
turn location tracking off at Facebook),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make appropriate requests (e.g.
opt-out requests) to service providers and data collectors,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up accounts with services (e.g.
credit bureaus) that will enable credit locks/freezes and other privacy protection measures on the user’s behalf.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing the above tasks, the Vogel app deletes the data for the user, on the Vogel app, as well as on the Vogel server.</p>
<p>Where is the information stored?</p>
<p>The information is stored temporarily on the user device (inside the Vogel app), or securely on the Vogel servers while the Vogel services are completed on behalf of the users.</p>
<p>All data collection by Vogel is temporary</p>
<p>The Vogel app collects the user data only for the period of time necessary (usually between a few seconds to a few minutes) to complete each Vogel service.
Thereafter, the data is discarded.</p>
<p>How is the information discarded?</p>
<p>The information is discarded from the Vogel app and the Vogel servers every time a task is completed.
The Vogel app running on the user’s device, and the Vogel server store the information temporarily in the memory (RAM) and not on any kind of long-term storage (disk).</p>©&nbsp.
