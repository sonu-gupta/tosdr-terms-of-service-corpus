<p>Like most web servers, ours logs each request and the IP address of the sender.
We only keep this information for a few months, or whenever it is replaced by the server -- it's only looked at by Joe when something might be wrong, and then generally only to find his own IP address to see the results of testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we send you an email, then our email service providers obviously do receive your email address so that they can deliver the message.
As of June 2018, we may send transactional or newsletter emails to you via HostedEmail.com, an OpenSRS.com service&nbsp.
or Amazon Simple Email Service&nbsp;.
Some emails might be sent directly from one of our servers.
Regardless, there may be a record in a log file somewhere, somehow, that indicates that we sent an email to you.
