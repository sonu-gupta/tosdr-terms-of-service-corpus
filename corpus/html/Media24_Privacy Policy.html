Such request can be submitted by using the data subject access request form found here.</p>

These security safeguards are based on generally accepted information security practices and procedures which apply to the Platforms, products and services we provide.
We regularly check that these safeguards are correctly implemented and continually updated in response to new risks or any identified deficiencies.</p>
<p>Any information you submit to us through the internet is at your own risk.
Once we receive your personal information, our security safeguards apply.</p>
<p>If we outsource any services to a third party that require the collection or use of your personal information, we put in place contracts that require these companies or people to respect the security of your personal information, treat it in accordance with the law, and collect and use it only for the purposes authorised by us.</p>
