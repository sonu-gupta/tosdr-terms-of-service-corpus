         Colophon <p> Or, how this site is made.
</p> Privacy
<p>I also use Adobe Fonts for one of the typefaces on the site (see below), and Adobe tracks font usage.
If you find a type-face that has some of the same character as Cronos Pro, shoot me an email.
I will seriously consider replacing it if I find something I like equally well.
I <em>loathe</em> Adobe’s approach to font licensing <em>and</em> to privacy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there is zero tracking — of any sort — on this site.</p>
Implementation
<p>I built this version of the site with Eleventy.
You can find the entirety of the implementation (and indeed the entire <em>history</em> of the implementation) on GitHub.
I’m using it with the following plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>typeset:</b> my own implementation of a plugin for typeset, heavily inspired by eleventy-plugin-typeset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>markdown-it plugins:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>abbreviations</li>
<li>anchor</li>
<li>definition list</li>
<li>footnote</li>
<li>implicit-figures</li>
<li>superscript</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>spacewell:</b> a little tool I built a few years ago to insert hair spaces around em dashes and thin spaces with non-breaking spans around number-separating en dashes.
the source is colocated with the rest of the site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
Typography
<p>Perhaps my favorite part of web design, and also the part with which I spend the most part <em>fussing</em>.</p> Context
Typeface Body text
Sabon, designed by Jan Tschichold in the mid-1960s as a Garamond revival.
In my opinion, the most beautiful Garamond in existence.
Licensed via Fonts.com.
Headings
Cronos, designed by Robert Slimbach in 1996.
A nice contrast to Sabon with its digital-era roots.
The typeface I’ve been using on my site the longest at this point! Licensed via Adobe Fonts.<sup>1</sup> Code
Hack, designed by Chris Simpkins in 2015 as an extension of the Deja Vu/Bitstream Vera lineage.
Licensed in parts under the <abbr>MIT</abbr> License, the public domain, and Bitstream Vera License (see details here).
Inspiration
<p>While working on this design, I took more-or-less-direct inspiration in a variety of ways from some of my favorite current or previous designs around the web:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tim Brown</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethan Marcotte</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trent Walton</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craig Mod — a truly wonderful site, but I actually loved the <em>previous</em> design iteration even more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jen Simmons — as with Mod’s current site, I really like what she’s doing on her site now — it’s all sorts of fun layout-wise — but it’s quite distinct from what she was doing when I was stealing ideas from her late in 2018!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reda Lemeden</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jason Santa Maria — from whom, if I recall, I originally got the idea of a versioned website.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Longtime readers may recall (and new readers may be curious about) my deep frustrations with this situation.
Nothing there has changed — but I ended up paying for Adobe’s Lightroom package when I picked back up photography, and it comes bundled.
So here we are.
