<strong>Last Revised: August 17, 2020</strong>
</p>
<p>Parsec Cloud, Inc.
("<strong>Parsec</strong>") is committed to protecting your privacy.
We have prepared this Privacy Policy (the "<strong>Policy</strong>") to inform you of our practices regarding the data we collect from and about users of our website, (the "<strong>Site"</strong>) and our downloadable desktop and mobile applications (together with the Site and any other products and services provided by Parsec, the "<strong>Services</strong>").</p>
<p>We provide important information for individuals located in the European Union, European Economic Area, and United Kingdom (collectively, "Europe" or "European") here and information for California residents here.</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to this Policy</strong>: We will post any modifications or changes to the Policy on the website.
We may modify the Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review it frequently.
The "Last Updated" legend above indicates when this Policy was last changed.
If we make any material change to the Policy, we will post a notice on the website prior to such changes taking effect.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Note About Children.<p>We do not intentionally gather personal information from individuals who are under the age of 13.
If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personal information to Parsec, we will make reasonable efforts to delete the information as soon as possible.
If you believe that we might have collected any personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at legal@parsec.app.</p>
</li>
<li>Types of Data We Collect.<p>We collect information about you when you use the Service or otherwise interact with us.
The types of information we collect about you includes:</p>

<strong>Contact data,</strong> such as your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone number.</li>

<strong>Profile data,</strong> such as your username and password that you may set when you establish an online account with us, your interests and preferences, including settings associated with your participation in community forum areas, how content is displayed, your location, safe search settings, and favorite widgets</li>

If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Service, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Please do not embed personal information in the content you generate or share personal information online in public or in community forums, because any such information can be collected and used by others.</p>
</li>
<li>Cookies.<p>Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website stores to your computer or mobile device while you access the website.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website.
This type of information is collected to make the website more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.
We use the following types of cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Essential Cookies -</strong> These cookies are essential to provide you with the Services and to enable you to use some of its features.
For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.
Without these cookies, the Services that you have asked for cannot be provided.</li>
<li>
<strong>Functionality Cookies - </strong> These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use the Services, such as login details and progress within a course.
The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit the Services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Analytics and Performance Cookies - </strong> These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the Services and how they are used.
The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor, and is aggregated and anonymized.
It includes information like the number of visitors to our website, referring websites, pages viewed on our website, what time of day they visited our website, and whether they have visited our website before.
We use this information to help operate our website more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our website.
We use Google Analytics, and Facebook for this purpose.
You can find out more information about how to opt out of tracking technologies in our Online Tracking Opt-out Guide below.</li>
<li>
<strong>Social Media Cookies - </strong> These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or "like" button on the Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
The social network will record that you have done this.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pixel Tag.</strong> In addition, we use <strong>"pixel tags"</strong> (also referred to as clear GIFs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).
Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages.
Pixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.
We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
We do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to our users’ personal information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do Not Track Signals.</strong> Some internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit.
We currently do not respond to do not track signals.
To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit https://allaboutdnt.com/.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information You Provide to Third Parties.<p>Our Services allows users to provide remote access to their computers in order to stream content.
The Services’ default configuration allows access to only limited functions of the host computer (i.e., controller), but you may change the configuration to allow greater access.
USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN ALLOWING ANY GUEST ACCESS TO ANY PROGRAMS, ROUTINES OR FUNCTIONS OF YOUR COMPUTER.
ACCESS CAN BE USED TO MISAPPROPRIATE PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION.
You are responsible for the content you stream and for what other users can view or access on your computer, and you are responsible for safeguarding the data users have access to on your computer.</p>
</li>

We make personal information into anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you.
We use anonymous data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve website navigation.
We may use this anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Service and promote our business.</p>

</li>
<li>Third-party platforms.<p>If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the Service to a third-party platform (including social media networks), we may disclose to the third-party platforms the personal information that you authorize us to share, or we may enable the third-party platforms to collect information directly via our Service.
By connecting a third-party platform, you are instructing us to share this information with the third-party platform.
