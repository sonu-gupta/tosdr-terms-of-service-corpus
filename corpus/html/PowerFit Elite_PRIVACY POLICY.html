HOW WE USE COOKIES.</strong> To enhance your experience with our site, our Web pages may use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences.
We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site[s].
For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our site[s].
We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.
We may also use tags and pixels to aid in your experience on our Sites and for advertising purposes.
<br>
<br>We also collect information through the use of "pixel tags" on our websites and in e-mail messages we may send to you that may be placed by us or third parties with whom we partner.
"Pixels," also known as "Web beacons," are tiny graphic files or code snippets, not visible to the human eye, that can be included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages and web pages.
When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer or device will communicate with our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient's e-mail address, the date and time the recipient viewed the e-mail message, the fact that the recipient's e-mail client is capable of receiving HTML-encoded e-mail, and other standard logging information.
The pixel tag may also see or read cookies.
Tristar Products may use pixel tags in order to measure and understand traffic better, improve site performance, track visitor behavior to improve user experience, and for tracking promotional and marketing campaign response, among others.
<br>
<br>We may contract with third-party vendors, who act on our behalf, to serve ads to our customers via the internet or to send directly to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services.
To do this, the vendors will collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our products and services.
This anonymous information is collected through the use of the cookie or pixel tag â€“ industry standard technology used by most major websites.
They may also pool the anonymous information that they collect with other sources of information not collected during your visit to our website, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving direct mail.<br>
<br>If you do not wish for cookies or pixel tags to be placed on your computer, most commercially available Web browsers permit you to modify your preferences to prevent that from taking place.
To opt-out of receiving our direct mail, you may send us an email at <strong>privacy@tristarproductsinc.com</strong> or call us at <strong>973-287-5134</strong>.
