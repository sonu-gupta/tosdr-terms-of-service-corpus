What information do we collect and for what purpose?
<p>In this section, we describe who collects visitor information on our Sites, how the information is collected, what type of information is collected, from whom the information is collected, and for what purpose.</p>
2.1.
Cookies and similar tracking technology
<p>Both we and certain third parties may employ cookies and related technology to track your device”s browsing activity on our Sites.
A “device” in this context refers to a computer, phone, tablet or similar device that you use to access the Internet.</p>
<p>Cookies are small data files that we or third parties may place on your device when you visit our Sites to mark that you have been there.
Cookies and related tracking technology, such as pixels or web beacons (which also utilize cookie technology), may be used to enhance and personalize the browsing experience on our Sites.
For example, they allow us and third parties to track your device’s browsing activity through the Sites over several sessions, including the websites your device accesses immediately before and immediately after visiting our Sites, the average time spent on our Sites, pages viewed on our Sites, and other statistics about the usage of our Sites.
Through this technology, the Sites can remember the preferences associated with your device (for example, language settings) and facilitate your access to and use of the Sites (for example, keeping your session active on our Sites).
We may also use information collected through this technology to monitor the performance of the Sites, for systems administration purposes, and to report visitor browsing patterns to our consultants and other third parties in aggregated form – meaning a form that does not enable any specific individual to be identified, and is thus not considered to be Personal Information.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar tracking technology may also be used to provide you with advertising on our Sites and on third party sites that better matches your interests and preferences, based on the record of your device”s browsing activity.</p>
<p>
<u>
<strong>We want you to be able to make clear and informed decisions about the use of cookies on the Sites.</strong>
</u> For more information about cookies and your options to accept, reject or limit the use of cookies on the Sites, please visit our Cookies Policy.</p>
2.2.
Collection of Personal Information
<p>Cookies may be used to track your device”s activity on our Sites.
At times, however, we will need to collect Personal Information that is specifically about you in order to provide certain services or functions on our Sites or to fulfill your requests.
This may occur, for example, when you are registering a user account on the Sites, signing up for newsletters or other communications on the Sites, or making a purchase through the Sites.
In these contexts, we may need to ask you to provide, among other things, your name, mailing address, postal code, email address and phone number.
When fulfilling a purchase order, we may also need to obtain payment verification information (for example, last four digits and expiry date of a credit card) and to gather additional information from third parties (including credit information) to determine your eligibility to fulfill your order.
You will also need to provide full payment information to our outsourced payment processor to complete an online purchase.
We do not receive your payment information for online purchases other than the limited verification details described above.</p>
<p>The Personal Information that you provide to us in these contexts will be used to provide you with products or services you have requested, to service your account, to improve our services, to respond to your questions and concerns, and other reasonable purposes identified at the time of collection.</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to transparency, when collecting Personal Information, we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>always indicate the specific, explicit and legitimate purpose for collection;</li>
<li>only collect Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to fulfill this purpose or these purposes;</li>
<li>not use the Personal Information for purposes other than those disclosed at the time of collection, except as permitted by law;</li>
<li>disclose the categories of third parties that may receive the Personal Information.
and</li>
<li>take every reasonable step to ensure that the Personal Information is accurate, having regard to the purpose(s) for which it was collected.</li>

Communication of your information to third parties
<p>In this section, we will describe the limited circumstances in which we may disclose your information to third parties.</p>
3.1.
Disclosure of your Personal Information to service providers
<p>We use a number of third parties to provide us with services which are necessary to run our business.
Examples include email providers, hosting providers and payment processors.
These services are often provided by service providers based in Canada, which the European Commission has determined to be adequate as a privacy regulatory environment.
We also work with service providers based in the United States that have self-certified compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information will be shared with these service providers where necessary in response to your requests, including accessing our Sites, registering a user account on our Sites, or ordering goods and services on our Sites.
We require our service providers to use and, where necessary, disclose Personal Information only in accordance with the purposes for which the information was collected.</p>
<p>When collecting Personal Information, we will disclose the categories of third parties that may receive your Personal Information.
We do not display the identities of our service providers publicly by name for security and competitive reasons.
If you would like further information about the identities of our service providers, please contact us at privacy@toonboom.com and we will provide you with such information where you have a legitimate reason for requesting it (where we have shared your information with such service providers, for example).</p>
3.2.
Disclosure of aggregated data to third parties
<p>We may aggregate statistics that we gather about our customers, sales, website traffic patterns, and products and services.
This aggregated data is not considered Personal Information, as it does not provide information about an identifiable individual.
We may disclose these statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes including management of the Sites, business optimization and market research.</p>
3.3.
Disclosure of your information for legal reasons
<p>In certain circumstances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Information to comply with legal obligations or to assert legal rights, as set out below.
In all cases, we will limit the disclosure to the degree reasonably necessary to satisfy the obligation or assert the right.</p>
<p>We may, for example, be required to disclose your Personal Information to a governmental, regulatory, law enforcement or judicial body pursuant to a court order, warrant, subpoena, or similar process.
We may also disclose your Personal Information to an appropriate authority if we or such authority suspects that criminal or potential criminal conduct has occurred.
This could be the case, for instance, if we suspect that fraud or a cyber crime has been committed or if we or a third party has received threatening or malicious communication.
We will generally only need to disclose your Personal Information for this purpose if you were involved or affected by such an incident.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information in connection with exercising our legal rights including, for example, sharing information with debt collection agencies if you do not pay amounts owed to us when you are contractually obliged to do so.
Our legal rights may be contractual (where we have entered into a contract with you) or non-contractual (such as legal rights that we have under copyright law or tort law).</p>
<p>We may need to disclose your Personal Information if we are involved in a dispute with you or a third party.
For example, it may be necessary to disclose your Personal Information to resolve a dispute or as part of any action related to indemnification, mediation, arbitration or court resolution or similar process.</p>

How is your information secured and protected?
<p>We use encryption and/or authentication tools, among other methods, to protect the transmission of Personal Information.
Please note, however, that emails you send to us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to us.</p>
<p>Certain sections of our Sites allow you to order products and services, for which you may be required to provide your credit card information.
These sections use Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for browsers that support 256-bit encryption.
TLS encrypts information to ensure that it travels securely between the customer and TOON BOOM.
You will know that your browser is secure by a change in the URL from “http://” to “https://”.
If the URL on a page asking you to provide information remains as “http://”, beware as this may result in an unsecure transmission.
If you are not using a browser which adheres to the TLS protocol and supports 256-bit encryption, the information you provide may not be secure and we recommend that you contact us by telephone at +1-514-278-8666 to place your order.</p>
<p>When processing credit card purchases over the Internet, our third party payment processor will verify your credit card information with the appropriate financial institution prior to processing your purchase.
Your interactions with this third party service provider are governed by the privacy policy of such third party”s website.
Neither we nor our third party service provider will supply your credit card information to any other third party.</p>
<p>We instruct our employees with access to your Personal Information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business.
Employees who misuse Personal Information will be subject to disciplinary measures or legal action by Toon Boom.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p> 6.

<p>
</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p> 7.
