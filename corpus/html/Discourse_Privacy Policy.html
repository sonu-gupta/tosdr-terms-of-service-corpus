What is CDCK? <p>CDCK is the company home and primary developer of Discourse, open source software for hosting Internet discussion forums.
As a company, CDCK hosts forums using Discourse for customers, as well as:</p>
<ul>
<li>meta.discourse.org, a discussion forum about Discourse itself,</li>
<li>discourse.org, a website marketing Discourse and CDCK’s hosting service,</li>
<li>blog.discourse.org, CDCK’s blog,</li>
<li>teams.discourse.com, a website marketing CDCK’s Discourse for Teams software,</li>
<li>support.teams.discourse.com, a website hosting Discourse for Teams support articles,</li>
<li>and rubytalk.org, a mirror of the “Ruby-Talk” mailing list for the Ruby programming language.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
Who is responsible for data collected about me? <p>CDCK is the responsible party, or controller, for the data we collect and process for our own purposes.
For instance, CDCK is responsible for data about our customers, employees, open source contributors, and visitors to our own websites and forums.</p>
<p>Importantly, CDCK sets only its own privacy practices, not the privacy practices of CDCK customers or others who host forums using our open source software.
You should ask all of those involved in administering and hosting Discourse forums that you use for information about their privacy practices.</p>
<p>Privacy inquiries or notices you send to CDCK about forums we host on behalf of our customers will be referred to the appropriate responsible party.</p>
<p>

Some forums that CDCK hosts store data in data centers in other jurisdictions, such as Canada and the European Union.
Refer to the Privacy Policy of the forum on which your account exists for detailed information.</p>
<p>
</p>
Does CDCK comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation? <p>CDCK respects privacy rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Information that GDPR requires CDCK to give can be found throughout this privacy notice, including information on the rights of data subjects.</p>
<p>
</p>
What are my rights under the GDPR? <p>The GDPR provides the following rights with respect to personal information about you that we collect or process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the right to access your personal data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete personal data</p>

<p>
</p>
How does CDCK safeguard international data transfers after Schrems II? <p>CDCK relies on the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international transfers(SCCs) to legally transfer personal data out of the European Economic Area.
Because national security and surveillance laws may be in conflict with European data protection rules, CDCK continually reassesses the practical reach of these laws to ensure our data transfers are adequately safeguarded.</p>
<p>Currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CDCK processes personal data on servers located outside the European Union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDCK uses subprocessors with personnel and computers outside the European Union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDCK has personnel in the United States, Australia, and other non-EU countries without EU adequacy decisions under GDPR.
These people need access to forum personal data in order to keep forums running, address security concerns, respond to privacy-related requests from users, field technical support requests, and otherwise assist customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDCK no longer participates in Privacy Shield, following its invalidation as an adequate safeguard for EU-US data transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDCK’s standard data processing addendum incorporates the standard contractual clauses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDCK is very likely subject to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the United States, a law that the European Court of Justice has found inadequately protects the rights and freedoms of data subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDCK has never received any order or request for personal data under FISA 702 or any similar national security or surveillance law of any other country.
CDCK is not subject to any court order or legal obligation that would prevent it from disclosing the existence or non-existence of such an order or request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDCK has adopted a policy for how we will respond to those orders and requests, in case we ever receive one.
CDCK will suspend processing, notify any customer for forums we host for others, minimize disclosure, and resist disclosure of personal data, all as the law allows.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
Does CDCK comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act? <p>CDCK complies with its obligations under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
CDCK does <em>not</em> sell your personal information within the meaning of that law.
Information on CCPA user rights — such as accessing or deleting your personal information — can be found throughout this privacy notice.
So can information about specific CCPA consumer rights, like requesting disclosure about information CDCK collects and requesting deletion of your personal information.</p>
<p>CDCK is not presently a “business” for the purposes of the CCPA, but we may act as a service provider for CCPA businesses when we host forums on behalf of customers.
We offer a standard Service Provider Agreement for CCPA business customers.</p>
<p>
</p>
Where can I access data about me? <p>You can see your account data at any time by visiting your account page on the forum.
Your account page also lists your posts and other activity on the forum.</p>
<p>Your account activity page also includes a link to download all of your activity in standard comma-separated values format.</p>
<p>If you do not have account with us but have a data access request, please contact us.</p>
<p>
</p>
How can I change or erase data about me? <p>You can change your account data at any time by visiting the profile settings page for your account.
The settings for a particular forum may also allow you to close your account, on the settings page for your account.
Closing your account starts a process of erasing or anonymizing CDCK’s records of data you provided for your account.
Forum administrators can also erase and anonymize accounts.</p>
<p>Depending on the settings for your particular forum, you may also be able to edit, anonymize, or erase your posts.
When you edit posts, CDCK will keep all versions of your posts.
Forum administrators can view old versions of posts, and optionally make them visible to other forum visitors.</p>
<p>
</p>
Does CDCK make automated decisions based on data about me? <p>
</p>
CDCK classifies posts as spam automatically.
<p>CDCK uses data about your posts and other activity on many forums to make automated decisions about whether your posts to meta.discourse.org and most forums that CDCK hosts are spam.
When Akismet decides that a post is likely spam, the forum refuses to accept the post.</p>
<p>If you think a post has been wrongly blocked or removed, contact an administrator of your forum.
They can override the decision that a post was spam.</p>
<p>
</p>
CDCK uses data about posts and activity to set trust levels automatically.
<p>Depending on how administrators of your forum configure the forum, the forum may use data about your posts and activity to award you badges and calculate a trust level for your account.
Your trust level may affect how you can participate in the forum, such as whether you can upload images, as well as give you access to moderation and management powers in the forum.
Your trust level therefore reflects forum administrators’ confidence in you, and their willingness to delegate community management functions, like moderation.</p>
<p>If you think your trust level has been set incorrectly, contact an administrator of your forum.
They can manually adjust the trust level of your account.</p>
<p>
</p>
Does CDCK share data about me with others? <p>CDCK shares account data with others as mentioned in the section about account data.</p>
<p>CDCK shares data about your posts and other forum activity with others as mentioned in the section about forum data.</p>
<p>CDCK uses the subprocessors listed on our subprocessors page when providing forums on behalf of our customers.
We may also share personal data with the service providers we use in order to transact with customers, host our website, deliver content, secure our services, store data, host and manage our open source project, market our services, and provide customer support.
These service providers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Akismet, for spam filtering</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services, for storage</li>
<li>GitHub, for open source development</li>
<li>Google, for analytics and storage</li>
<li>Stripe, for processing payments</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
How does CDCK document compliance for forum hosting customers? <p>CDCK provides a standard data processing addendum for European Union General Data Protection Regulation compliance on request.
The addendum incorporates the non-EU/non-EEA processor standard contractual clauses of Commission Decision 2010/87/EU for any regulated transfers.</p>
<p>CDCK also provides a standard addendum for compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act on request.</p>
<p>
