<p>All the resources on Corbettmaths, videos, worksheets, 5-a-day and everything else, have been created, over 1000’s of hours, by Corbettmaths.
The resources are&nbsp;free&nbsp;(<strong>and will always be free</strong>)&nbsp;to use for individual use or for use by teachers for their classes.</p>
<p>I only ask that you keep in consideration the amount of work that I have put into the website and content, and&nbsp;<strong>if in doubt over your planned use of the resources, please feel free to ask me directly</strong>&nbsp;(there is a Contact button on the right hand side).</p>
<p>I encourage colleagues&nbsp;to “link” to my resources on their school websites, VLEs or personal website rather that uploading copies of my files.
The main reason for this is that I constantly update and improve my worksheets and this avoids older versions of my files being found online.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances can any Corbettmaths resource be used by anyone for profit making purposes.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances can any Corbettmaths resource (including individual questions) be used within other resources that are redistributed.
An example being, copying Corbettmaths&nbsp;questions and then uploading on any teaching&nbsp;resources websites.</p>
<p>Please&nbsp;<strong>never</strong> pass any of my work off as your own (including individual questions) as all work is copyrighted.
Make sure it is very clear that it is if a resource is being linked to, that Corbettmaths is the owner of the resource and its use is subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
