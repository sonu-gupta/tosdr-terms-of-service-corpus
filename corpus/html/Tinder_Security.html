Internal Tinder Security Practices
<p>The security program at Tinder protects our organization and your data at every turn utilizing a combination of industry-leading security infrastructure, responsible data practices, and security best practices to stay ahead of the evolving number of threats facing all internet services and infrastructure.
Our security program is focused on the following domains:</p>

Tinder enforces the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) internally.

Our applications and systems, including new features, code, and configuration changes pass through security design reviews and assessments by our internal teams.
Additionally, many of these applications and systems undergo routine independent and rigorous pen tests through reputable third-party security experts.</p>

All employees undergo security and privacy training annually.
Security is everyone’s responsibility at Tinder.

We perform extensive security risk assessments of our system and our third-party vendors regularly to ensure a secure posture.</p>
<p>
<strong>Red Team / Offensive Security:</strong> Our internal Red Team identifies previously unknown security vulnerabilities in existing systems and workflows through offensive security testing.
This group simulates real-world attacks on all areas of the company and prioritizes upleveling security posture to address areas of greatest risk.
Our goal is to gain insight into any potential exposures, and to continuously test to reduce the likelihood of a breach.</p>
