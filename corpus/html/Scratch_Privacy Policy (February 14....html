<i>The Scratch Privacy Policy was last updated: February 14, 2019</i>
</p>
<p>Scratch understands how important privacy is to our community, especially kids and parents.
We wrote this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through our website (scratch.mit.edu) (the "Site"), how we use, process, and share it, and what we're doing to keep it safe.
It also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your information, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>If you would like to build projects with Scratch without submitting any Personal Information to us, you can download the Scratch Offline Editor.
Projects created in the Scratch Offline Editor are not accessible by the Scratch Team, and using the offline editor does not disclose any personally identifying information to Scratch unless you upload these projects to the Scratch online community.</p>
<dl>What personal information does the Scratch Team collect about me?<p>For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.
We obtain Personal Information relating to you from various sources described below.</p>
<p>Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so.
If you do not provide Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Site if that information is necessary to provide you with the service or if we are legally required to collect the information.</p>
<dt>Account Information</dt>
<dd>In order to share projects, create studios, or post comments, you need to make an account.
During account creation, we ask you for a username, your country, birth month and year, gender, and your email address (or your parent or guardian's email address if you are under 16 years old).
We ask that you select a username that does not disclose your real name or other information that could identify you.
Other users can see your username and country, but not your age, gender, or email address.</dd>
<dt>User-generated Content</dt>
<dd>We collect any information that you provide to us when you create Scratch projects (including unshared projects), write comments, or post on our forums.</dd>
<dt>Communications</dt>
<dd>If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you.
For example, when you contact our Customer Support Team, we may receive your name, email address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.</dd>
