<p>
<strong>Information about you</strong>.
While some of the Services may not require you to provide any information that can directly identify you by name, the specific types of information we collect will depend upon the Services you use, how you use them, and the information you choose to provide.
The types of data we collect directly from you includes:</p>

If you request that your Bose purchase be shipped to someone other than yourself (such as a gift recipient), we use the information you provide about the other person to fulfill the shipment.</p>
<p>
<strong>Bose ID</strong>.
Some of our products and features will allow you or require you to create an account and establish a Bose ID.
This ID may allow you to sign into a range of Bose Services.
It also enables Bose to consolidate information collected across a range of Bose products and services, which helps us provide you with a more seamless experience across our Services.<br>
&nbsp;</p> 2.
Information We Collect Through Automated Means <p>When you use our Services, we collect certain information as described in this Section.
As discussed further below, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf), may use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Websites</strong>.
When you use our websites, we collect and analyze information such as your IP address, browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, software and hardware attributes (including device IDs) referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, files you download, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the terms you use in searches on our sites, the date and time you used the Services and upload or post content, error logs, and other similar information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Connected Bose Products</strong>.&nbsp;If you connect your Bose product (such as headphones or speakers) to the Internet or to a Bose mobile application or software, we may automatically receive information from the Bose product about how you use the product.
Such information includes:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical data, such as your product serial number or model number, device operating system version, MAC address(es), Wi-Fi® signal strength, firmware version, IP address, SSIDs, log files, durations, service tokens, Internet connection type and carrier, and unique identifiers associated with the computer, tablet, or mobile device used in connection with the Bose product</li>
<li>Usage data, such as time spent using different features/settings of the product, the day and time you used the product, sensor data (e.g.
head orientation and movement), button presses, the media and other external sources to which you connect your product, and, as applicable, your product’s power spectrum, sound pressure level, volume levels, and streaming information (including content stored on system presets, stations played, playlists, artists, albums, songs, or podcasts), time zone, and transactional data enabling digital rights management (e.g., for music content providers to give appropriate credit to artists depending on how often their content is played)</li>
<li>Service “tokens” containing authentication information that enables delivery of third-party content to your Bose product (e.g., to synch your connected products to your Spotify account each time you use them)</li>
<li>Diagnostic data, such as battery life, the quality of the wireless connection, and error logs).
and</li>
<li>Environmental data (e.g., noise level and audio frequencies).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Bose Mobile Applications and Software.</strong> When you use a Bose mobile application or software, we automatically receive certain information about the mobile phone, tablet, or computer used to access the application or software, including a mobile device identifier, IP address, operating system, version, Internet service provider, browser type, domain name and other similar information, whether and when you update the app and your connected Bose products, date and time of use, and how you use the app, including time spent in different portions of the application, content accessed or downloaded (including stations played, playlists, artists, albums, songs, or podcasts), and list of systems and software applications.</p>
<p>
<strong>A special note about the Bose Connect Application.</strong> Please note that if you are a user of the Bose Connect Application, you can opt out of the collection of diagnostic and usage data by visiting the Privacy Policy &amp.
Settings menu in the Bose Connect Application.</p>
<p>
<strong>Location Information</strong>.
When you use the Services, we and our service providers may automatically collect general location information (e.g., IP address, city/state and or postal code associated with an IP address) from your computer or mobile device.
This information allows us to enable access to content that varies based on a user’s general location (e.g., providing access to local radio stations).</p>
<p>We will ask your permission before collecting your precise GPS location information.
In such instances, we will use your precise geo-location information to provide customized services, content, promotional offers and other information that may be of interest to you.
We may also use this information to enable you to locate a lost or stolen device.
If you no longer wish for us and our service providers to collect and use GPS location information, you may disable the location features on your device.
Please see your device manufacturer settings.
Please note that if you disable such features, you will not be able to access or receive some or all of the services, content, features, and/or products made available via the Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>Collection of Information Across Bose Products, Personal Devices, and Applications</strong>.
Sometimes, we (or our service providers) may use the information we collect — for instance, usernames, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers — to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or connected Bose products), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices.
If you wish to opt out of cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your Android or Apple device-based settings.</p> 3.
Information We Collect at Bose Retail Locations <p>We use a third-party service provider, RetailNext, to gather mobile and video analytics in Bose retail stores.
This service provider provides insights about consumers’ behavior in and around Bose retail stores based on the collection of information from consumers’ Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth-enabled devices and from in-store video cameras.
The information collected is handled by Bose in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information about how RetailNext handles such information can be found in their privacy policy.
More information about the data we collect through RetailNext.</p>
<p>At Bose retail locations or third-party retail locations that sell Bose products, you may additionally have the ability to connect your personal devices to Bose digital displays or to otherwise provide information about yourself through such displays.
If you choose to connect to such displays or provide Bose with information about yourself in this way, the types of information we collect include the type of phone you are using to initiate the connection (e.g., iOS7) and the name you assigned to your phone (if any).<br>
</p> 4.
Information We Collect from Social Media and Other Platforms <p>If you access the Services through a third-party connection or log-in (e.g., through a social network), you may allow us to have access to and store certain information from your social network profile.
This includes your name, gender, profile picture, your “likes” and check-ins, and your list of friends, depending on your settings on such services.
If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not use a social networking connection to access the Services.
For a description of how social networking sites handle your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you connect your Bose device to underlying platforms or content providers (e.g., Spotify, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant), such providers allow us and our service providers to have access to and store additional information about your interaction with those providers as it relates to use of the Services (e.g., to display your recently-played Spotify playlist within Bose connected products and mobile applications, understand how often you use Alexa to play music, etc.).
If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not initiate these connections.<br>
</p>
<p>When you “like” or “follow” us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other social media sites, we may collect some information from you including your name, e-mail address, and any comments or content you post relevant to us.
We also collect your information if you sign up for one of our promotions or submit information to us through social media sites.</p> 5.
Information We Collect from Others <p>Bose may receive additional information such as demographic and statistical information from third parties, such as business partners, marketers, researchers, analysts, and other parties that we may attribute to you based on your assignment to certain statistical groups.
We use this information to supplement the information that we collect directly from you in order to derive your possible interests and to provide more relevant experiences for you with the Bose brand and improve Bose’s products, analytics, and advertising.<br>
</p> HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION <p>We, or our service providers, use your information (including any information that we collect, as described in this Privacy Policy) for various business and operational purposes depending on the types of information we have collected from and about you and the specific Bose Services you use, in order to:</p>

</ul> COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES <p>To collect the information in the “Information We Automatically Collect” section above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies.
We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.</li>
<li>An SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Services.</li>
<li>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer.
(ii) store your preferences and settings.
(iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited.
(iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests.
(v) perform searches and analytics.
and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions.
Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files.</li>
<li>Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email that are designed to: (1) collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates.
(2) measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising.
and (3) access user cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.</p>
<p>For more information on how to change your cookie settings, as well as the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, please refer to our Cookies Notice.<br>
</p> ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING 1.
Analytics <p>We may use third-party web&nbsp;and mobile application analytics services&nbsp;(such as those of Google Analytics, Segment, Crashlytics, Firebase, Kinesis, Localytics, and Bazaarvoice) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools.
engage in auditing, research, or reporting.
assist with fraud prevention.
and provide certain features to you.
To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
We may also use Adobe Analytics to analyze and optimize the performance of our websites, advertising, and content.&nbsp;Learn more about Adobe’s privacy practices and to make choices regarding Adobe’s tracking activities.</p>
<p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.
This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p> 2.
Online Advertising <p>The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use.
The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you.
These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above.
We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.
We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties.
If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page.
We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.
We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p> 3.
Mobile Advertising <p>When using mobile applications from Bose or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements.
We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications.
Each operating system, e.g.
iOS for Apple phones and Android for Android devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements.
thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.
You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.<br>
</p> 4.
Notice Concerning Do Not Track.
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.
However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.
Learn more about Do Not Track.</p> HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION <p>Bose will share your information in the following ways:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Affiliates and Subsidiaries.</em>
</strong> We may share information we collect within the Bose family of companies (e.g, Bose’s manufacturing, distribution, and product development companies) to deliver products and services to you, ensure a consistent level of service across our products and Services, and enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Service Providers.</em>
</strong> We provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf.
They have access to perform these services but are prohibited from using your information for other purposes.
They provide a variety of services to us, including billing, sales, marketing, product content and features (e.g., voice activation/recognition services), advertising, analytics, research, customer service, shipping and fulfillment, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and legal services.
Such parties currently include crash and bug analytics providers like Crashlytics, and service providers like Segment that enable us to connect your Bose products to your device and provide us with analytics for internal purposes.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Music Streaming and Other Third-party Services.</em>
</strong>&nbsp;When you initiate a connection with a third-party streaming service through the Services, we will share information about you that is required to enable delivery of the third-party content (e.g.
your streaming service log-in credentials).
Similarly, if you use a third-party service that works in connection with your Bose product, you acknowledge that information may be shared with the third party during the connection (e.g.
information about how you use your Bose product).
If you choose to initiate these connections, you agree that the third-party’s policies and terms, and not Bose’s, govern these connections.
We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Protection of Bose and Others.</em>
</strong> By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain and disclose the information we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, retention or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (e.g.
a subpoena or court order).
(b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof.
(c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties.
(d) respond to your requests for customer service.
and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Bose, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Business Transfers.</em>
</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies.
In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions) user information may be among the transferred assets.
If a portion or all of Bose’s assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, Bose will comply with such restrictions.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Bose Learning Hub.</em>
</strong> If you use the Bose Learning Hub in connection with your employment, we may share information about the training modules and other activities in which you participate and complete through the Learning Hub and based on our applicable agreement with your employer.</li>
