<p>Click to review previous version.</p>
<p>Welcome to the network of interactive services provided by CBS Interactive Inc., its affiliates or its subsidiaries (collectively “CBS Interactive,” “us,” or “we”).
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of our websites, applications, and other products and services that include an authorized link to these Terms (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
<p>Please review these Terms carefully before using the Services because they affect your rights.
By using any of the Services, you accept these Terms and agree to be legally bound by them.</p>
<p>Please consult our Privacy Policy for Information regarding our privacy practices.</p>
<p>Certain Services are provided to you free of charge, while other Services, including Paramount+ and SportsLine, require payment before you can access them.
If you choose to subscribe to a paid Service, please also review such Service’s Terms of Use.
For example, if you subscribe to Paramount+, please review the Paramount+ Subscription Terms, in addition to all of the other provisions of these Terms.</p>1.
Changes<p>These Terms are effective as of the Effective Date above.
If you have not reviewed the Terms of Use applicable to a Service since the Effective Date, please review these updated Terms carefully before using any Service.</p>
<p>We may change these Terms in the future, so we encourage you to review periodically the Terms of Use applicable to each Service you use.
The most current version of the applicable Terms of Use (along with its effective date) will be linked from each of the Services.
If you do not agree with any changes to these Terms, your sole remedy is not to use the Services.
If you continue to use the Services after we change these Terms, you accept all changes.</p>2.
Disputes.
Arbitration<p>If you have any dispute with or claim against us or any of our affiliates, or if we have a dispute with or claim against you, in either case arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms (a “Claim”), and the Claim is not resolved by calling our Customer Service department at (888) 274-5343, you and we each agree to attempt to resolve such Claim first through informal negotiation.
If we do not resolve the Claim through informal negotiation, the Claim shall be resolved through binding arbitration or an individual action in small claims court in the U.S.
county (or parish) of your residence or in San Francisco, California.
If neither of us chooses to resolve the Claim in small claims court, or the small claims court determines that it lacks jurisdiction to resolve the Claim, the Claim must be resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration.
Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted under any circumstances.
You and we agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.
This Section 2 shall survive termination of these Terms or any subscription that you may have to any of the Services.</p>
<p>Before you or we commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action with respect to a Claim, you must first send to CBS Interactive a written notice of your Claim or we must send a written notice of our Claim to you (“Notice”).
Your Notice must (1) be sent by certified mail.
(2) be addressed to: CBS Interactive, Attn: Legal Department, 235 Second Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
(3) describe the nature of your Claim.
and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek.
If we and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after you receive a Notice of Receipt of the Claim, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action to resolve the Claim.</p>
<p>Any such arbitration shall be administered by the JAMS Mediation, Arbitration and ADR Services (“JAMS”) in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as modified by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards (the “JAMS Rules”).
Contact information for JAMS, as well as copies of the JAMS Rules and applicable forms, are available at http://www.jamsadr.com.
In circumstances in which the JAMS Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will take place in the U.S.
county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in San Francisco, California.
Payment of the parties’ costs and fees owed to JAMS will be determined by the JAMS Rules and fee schedule, and will be subject to any limitations on the costs and fees owed by you under the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards.
You and we agree that, under JAMS Comprehensive Rule 6(e), any arbitration commenced by you or by us shall be consolidated with any other arbitration(s) submitted to JAMS if and only if the arbitrations: (a) involve the same legal claims or causes of action.
(b) involve common issues of fact and law.
(c) were filed by the same attorney(s) or law firm.
and (d) are at a similar procedural stage.
However, class or representative arbitrations are not permitted under any circumstances.</p>3.
Additional Terms<p>Additional terms may apply to your use of certain Services.
We will provide these terms to you or post them on the Services to which they apply, and they are incorporated by reference into these Terms.
If there is a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms that apply to a particular Service, the additional terms will control.</p>
<p>Sweepstakes, contests, and promotions on the Services may also have additional rules and eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions.
You are responsible for complying with these rules and requirements.</p>4.
Registration and Access Controls<p>If we request registration information from you to set up a user account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information and must update the information when it changes.
You may not access any age-restricted Services unless you are above the required age.</p>
