<p>We may collect information using “cookies” or similar technologies (altogether, “Cookies”).
Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.
We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.</p>
<p>We use two broad categories of Cookies: (1) first party Cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site.
and (2) third party Cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>
<p>Cookies we use</p>
<p>Our Site uses the following types of Cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>
<p>Type of cookie:&nbsp;Local Storage</p>
