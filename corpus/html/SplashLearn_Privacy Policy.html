“Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules or regulations.
In this document "Personal Data" shall apply to Personal Data of individual Service users who are not child registrants.
References to "Children's Personal Data" shall only apply to Personal Data of child users of the Services.
General references to "data" or “information” shall apply to all users.
Company gathers Personal Data and Children’s Personal Data when you or your child access the Services and when you or your child use Company's Services.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how your Personal Data is handled, please email us at compliance@splashlearn.com How is children's Personal Data treated? The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age.
Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) requires that data controllers obtain consent from the holders of parental responsibility over children who are under 16 years of age before such controllers knowingly collect and process Personal Data from such children.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from a child under the age of 13 (if such child is located in the United States) or a child under the age of 16 (if such child is located in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom) (in each case, a “Child under the Age of Consent”) <small>[RHH4] </small>without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (such consent, “Parental Consent” and such individual, “Parent ”), except for the limited amount of Personal Data we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (“Required Information”).
Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent.
Parental Consent is further described below in the “Data about Children” section.
If you are a Child under the Age of Consent , you may not register for the Services or otherwise disclose any Personal Data to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except that you may share Required Information solely for the purpose of the Company obtaining Parental Consent.
You may only interact with the Services under an account created by your Parent who has provided Parental Consent.
If you believe that a Child under the Age of Consent has provided us with Personal Data (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at help@splashlearn.com.
We do not condition participation in our Services on disclosure of more Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent than is reasonably necessary for that child’s participation in the Services, and we do not retain Personal Data from Children under the Age of Consent <small>[RHH9]</small> any longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.
If you are a Parent of a user of our Services who is a Child under the Age of Consent<small>[RHH10]</small> , you
may contact us at any time (compliance@splashlearn.com) to ask that (a) we stop collecting Personal Data from such user, (b) we delete any Personal Data already collected from such user (although note that we may further retain and use Anonymized Data as set forth the “Data that is Not Personal Data” section below), or (c) we stop disclosing Personal Data collected from such user to third parties, but continue to allow for collection and use of Personal Data collected from such user in connection with the Services.
If you are a child and your parent has signed up for the Service, you understand that your parent may be able to view all data within or associated with the account, including without limitation progress reports and usage data that tracks your performance on games, assessments and other tests available through the Services.
What Personal Data Does Company Collect? The Personal Data you provide is used for such purposes as providing you the services, answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Company's products and services, including specials and new features.
The Children's Personal Data you provide shall only be used for creating your individual account (which will allow you to receive progress reports that include tracking your child's performance and progress).
You can choose not to provide us with certain data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.
You may review, modify, stop collection of or remove your Personal Data or Children's Personal Data identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information.
If you are a teacher or a school, by sharing information about students (“Student Data”) or other data to SplashLearn, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to SplashLearn a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license during the term of the Agreement to use, transmit, distribute, modify, reproduce, display, and store the Student Data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the Services as contemplated by the Agreement, and as otherwise described herein, (ii) maintaining, supporting, evaluating, improving and developing our products, applications, and Service, and (iii) enforcing our rights under the Agreement.
We collect the following types of data from our customers: Data about Children
We collect certain information about children such as screen name and gender directly from Parents when such Parents set up an account.
For additional information about the data that we collect from children, please see the table further below.
If you are a teacher or a school administrator, you may also provide a full name for each applicable child to be able to track progress and distinguish students.
Therefore, you may choose to provide a different identifier instead of a child’s name for this purpose.
You may also provide us with a username and a password for each of the student accounts.
A child (or parent) can record their voice while reading a digital book and play it back to help them learn to read.
This recording stays on your device and is not sent to our servers.
The recording is automatically deleted as soon as the child moves to the next page of the book.
The record voice feature is optional, and parents can deny microphone access without affecting the child's access to the books.
When using our tutoring program (“SplashLearn Course” ), Parents may choose to provide us or the tutor conducting the program (“Tutor”) certain information about the student to help the Tutor improve their instruction.
Note that it is not mandatory to provide any such information and if you provide it, it is completely of your own volition.
In addition, children may share information, including Personal Data, about themselves during tutoring sessions.
The SplashLearn Course sessions (“Course Sessions”) may take place over online videos in which video images and audio of the children are recorded.
Parents may choose to ask the Tutor to not record the session.
No information is collected directly from children until they are in the course session.
Children cannot post Personal Data publicly anywhere on the Services, however, in group classes, students can share information, including Personal Data, with other students.
It is reasonable to expect that either the parent or the student will provide basic information like the student's name to facilitate the Course Sessions.
<strong>Class Video Recordings:</strong> As described above, SplashLearn may record videos of students and tutors during the Course Sessions (“Class Recordings”).
Please note the Class Recordings may accidentally capture persons (including other children) in the background other than the enrolled children.
The Class Recordings are made available by SplashLearn to the Tutor providing that Course Session as a means to improve the quality of instruction.
Tutors are obliged not to share the recordings with any third party in any scenario.
Class Recordings may also be shared with the entire class (and their Parents) (the “Permitted Recipients”) to view, for the purpose of reviewing the lessons.
SplashLearn will make reasonable attempts to ensure that the Class Recordings are not further downloaded or shared by the permitted recipients.
SplashLearn may also use Class Recordings to provide feedback to Tutors, for customer support, and for compliance purposes.
SplashLearn will obtain additional parental consent before we use any Class Recordings for promotional or other purposes.
Class Recordings will not be shared with third parties.
<strong>Parental Consent:</strong> SplashLearn obtains verifiable parental consent before collecting Personal Data from your child For example, SplashLearn may obtain parental consent by requiring the parent to provide their credit card information in order to register the child for and pay for a SplashLearn Class (“Parental Consent”).
If the parent does not provide consent, we will not collect, use or disclose any Personal Data about the child, and the child will not be allowed to use the Services in any way.
