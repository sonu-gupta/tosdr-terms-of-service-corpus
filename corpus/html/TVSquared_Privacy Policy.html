<p>TV Squared’s attribution services involve measuring an advertiser’s end users’ response to TV advertising on various mediums, including website and app.
TV Squared relies on certain types of data to provide these services, depending on the type of response being measured.
The cookies that an advertiser’s end user may find on its browser (depending on settings) after navigating to one of our advertiser’s websites or applications are as set out below.
Additional cookies may be added, and we may update or remove the cookies below.</p>CookieExpiresType of cookiePurpose<p>_pk_uid</p>

<p>TV Squared’s opt-out mechanism.
The advertiser, as the owner or manager of its website and applications, is responsible for informing its end users about all data being collected (including data from TV Squared) and for collecting appropriate consents from end users, in accordance with applicable data and privacy laws.</p>
<p>TV Squared has implemented an opt-out mechanism (http://collector.tvsquared.com/optout.php) which the advertiser can make available to its end users.
The opt-out applies solely to the TV Squared cookie placed on an end user’s browser or operating system when the end user visited the advertiser’s website or application.</p>
<p>This mechanism will not opt an end user out of all TV Squared cookies.
If an end user visits another advertiser’s website or application, and that advertiser is using TV Squared’s attribution services, the end user will receive other TV Squared cookies specific to that advertiser (and which cookies the end user would need to disable also).</p>
<p>Additional guidance.
End users may also wish to manage their cookies on a wider basis through their browser or operating system settings on their computer or device.
They can find out instructions on how to do this through the browser or operating system they are using.</p>
<p>The Digital Advertising Alliance (www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org) and Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org) also provide helpful resources for end users in relation to opting out of interest-based ads, re-setting advertising IDs, and limiting ad tracking.</p>

<ul>
<li>with our offices outside the EEA;</li>
<li>with your and our service providers located outside the EEA;</li>
<li>if you are based outside the EEA.
or</li>
<li>where there is an international dimension to the <em>services</em> we are providing to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>These transfers are subject to special rules under European and UK data protection law.</p>
<p>These non-EEA countries do not have the same data protection laws as the United Kingdom and EEA.
We will, however, ensure the transfer complies with data protection law and all personal data will be secure.
