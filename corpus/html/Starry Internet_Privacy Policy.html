<p>
<strong>Consumers may ask for a copy of their personal information or ask that we delete their personal information.</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have provided your personal information to receive Service, entered personal information through a form on our Sites, or have given us personal information in other ways, you can request a copy of the personal information about you that we currently hold and you can request that we delete this information.</p>
<p>You can make three different types of requests through the form below: (1) to know the categories of personal information we collect, the reason we collect it, and the categories of third parties with which we share it.
(2) this information plus the specific pieces of your personal information that we have on file.
or (3) to delete all of your personal information we have on file.
You can also call our customer care team at 888-231-9403 to make these requests.</p>
<p>Get Started</p>
<p>When you make a request, we will collect four basic pieces of personal information, which we will match with our records to reasonably verify your identity.
After you submit the form, you will receive an email confirmation with instructions on an additional step that we require you take to help verify your identity and email address.
We endeavor to respond promptly to your request once we reasonably verify your identify.
Note that if you request your personal information more than twice in a twelve-month period, we may be unable to respond.
And rest assured, we do not discriminate against any consumer who makes these requests.</p>
<p>If we are unable to verify your identity, we may not respond to your request.
Because we cannot validate the identity of visitors to our Sites, we are unable to share a copy of your personal information or delete your personal information that we have from you if you have only visited our Sites.
However, visitors to our Sites can reference the chart above for details about the personal information we collect, the reasons why we collect it, and the categories of third parties with which we share the information.

This will include the number of requests, as described above, and the median number of days to respond to requests for the prior twelve-month period.</p>
<p>
<strong>Consumers may submit requests through authorized agents.</strong>
</p>
<p>You may authorize a third party to submit a request on your behalf as your authorized agent.

We will validate your identity using the same process described in this Privacy Notice, and will only provide requested personal information to your email address that we have on file.
If your authorized agent must receive the information directly to their own email address instead of yours, you or the agent may contact Starry directly at privacy@starry.com.</p> We strive to protect the information we collect <p>We use technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access to, use of, or disclosure of the information that we collect and store.
But no security program is 100 percent secure.
As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose information.</p> California privacy rights, which we meet for all of our customers, are reflected in this Privacy Notice <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act grants several privacy rights to residents of California, and we believe these same rights should apply to any consumer, in any state.
These rights are reflected in this Privacy Notice and we apply them uniformly to all consumers.</p> We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time <p>You will find the most current version of this Privacy Notice at www.starry.com/legal.
We may make changes to this Privacy Notice at any time.
The text of this Privacy Notice was updated on January 2, 2020, to improve the clarity of our description of the circumstances in which we share information with third parties and to comply in part with the California Consumer Privacy Act.
If we make any changes we believe are material, we will provide you notice at least 30 days in advance.
In most cases, if you continue to use the Service, visit the Sites, or use the Apps after we have posted or otherwise notified you of changes to this Privacy Notice, that will indicate your acceptance of those changes.
However, we will obtain your affirmative consent if we make material changes to the way in which we use information that personally identifies you and that was collected from your use of our Service, before such change is made.</p> Download a copy of our Privacy Policy here
