Introduction</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are a cloud based platform for professionals.</p>
<p>1.1 Purpose</p>
<p>Our mission to enable enterprises to evaluate current business performance and estimate the business value of potential business transformation options that may exist for their enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you use our Services you are entering into a legal agreement and you agree to all of these terms.</p>
<p>You agree to provide only truthful information you are authorized to provide.</p>
<p>You also agree to our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store information you provide.</p>
<p>1.2 Agreement</p>
<p>You agree that by clicking “Register”, “Join”, “Join Now”, “Sign Up”, “Login”, “Sign in” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services, you are entering into a legally binding agreement (even if you are using our Services on behalf of a company) with surfaceOwl Inc.</p>
<p>You agree to only provide information that is truthful and that you are authorized to provide.
&nbsp;You also agree to provide only information that does not violate the law nor anyone's rights (e.g., without violating any intellectual property rights or breaching a contract).
You also agree that your profile information will be truthful.</p>
<p>This “Agreement” includes this User Agreement and the Privacy Policy, and other terms that will be displayed to you at the time you first use certain features, as may be amended by surfaceOwl from time to time.

Obligations</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Here are promises you make to surfaceOwl in this agreement:</p>
<p>You are eligible to enter into this agreement and you are at least our “Minimum Age”.</p>
<p>2.1 Service Eligibility</p>
<p>To use the Services, you agree that: &nbsp;(1) &nbsp;you must be the “Minimum Age” (defined below) or older.
(2) you will have only one surfaceOwl account per individual.
(3) you are authorized by your company to provide all information required about your company to use the Services.</p>
<p>“Minimum Age” means (a) 18 years old for the People's Republic of China, (b) 16 years old for the Netherlands, (c) 14 years old for the United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia and South Korea, and (d) 13 years old for all other countries.
However, if law requires that you must be older in order for surfaceOwl to lawfully provide the Services to you (including the collection, storage and use of your information) then the Minimum Age is such older age.
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 13.</p>
<p>You will follow the law, and our rules.</p>
<p>You will keep your password a secret.</p>
<p>You will not share an account with anyone else.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;Your Account</p>
<p>Your account belongs to you.
&nbsp;You are responsible for everything that happens through your account.
&nbsp;As such, you agree to (1) follow the law.
(2) choose a strong password.
(3) keep your password confidential and secure.
(4) not share your account with any other person(s).</p>
<p>You will honor all payment obligations and accept that we store payment information either directly or with a 3rd&nbsp;party.</p>
<p>You agree that there may be fees and taxes added on to prices, and that we do not guarantee refunds.</p>
<p>2.3 Payment</p>
<p>When you purchase any of our Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes.
&nbsp;Failure to pay these fees and taxes may result in termination of your subscription.
&nbsp;Also:</p>
<p>2.3.1.
Foreign Exchange Fees.
&nbsp;If you are located outside the United States, your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees based on location.</p>
<p>2.3.2.
You authorize us to store and continue billing your payment method even after it has expired, to avoid termination of service and to facilitate easy payment for new services.</p>
<p>2.3.3.
Taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>2.3.4.
Unless an order says something different, (a) all subscriptions automatically renew (without the need to go through the services-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal order form) for additional periods equal to one (1) year or the preceding term, whichever is shorter.
and (b) the per-unit pricing during any automatic renewal term will remain the same as it was during the immediately prior term.
Either party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a subscription term to stop the subscriptions from automatically renewing.</p>

and (b) Client has first requested such information from surfaceOwl and surfaceOwl failed to make such information available (for a fee or otherwise) under reasonable terms and conditions.
Any information supplied to or obtained by Client under this section is confidential information of surfaceOwl, may only be used by Client for the purpose described in this section, and will not be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software that is substantially similar to the expression of surfaceOwl technology.</p>

General Terms</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Here are some important details about how to read the Agreement.</p>
<p>7.1 Valid Agreement</p>
<p>If a court with authority over this Agreement finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent.
If the court cannot do that, we agree to jointly ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Agreement.
To the extent allowed by law, the English version of this Agreement is binding and other translations are for convenience only.
This Agreement (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>
<p>If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Agreement, that does not mean that surfaceOwl has waived its right to enforce this Agreement.
You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent.
However, you agree that surfaceOwl may assign this Agreement to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent.
There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.2 Reserved Right to Change Agreement Terms</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Agreement and will provide you notice if we do and we agree that changes cannot be retroactive.
If you don't agree to these changes, you must stop using the Services.</p>
<p>7.3 Single Legal Notice Address</p>
<p>You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the physical mailing address provided in Section 8.</p>
