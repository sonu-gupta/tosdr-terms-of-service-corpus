<em>Effective starting: August 6, 2019</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for using Atlassian’s Cloud Products!&nbsp.
These Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service (these <strong>“Terms”</strong>) describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of our Cloud Products.
As applicable to the specific Cloud Product, if you are being invited or added to a Cloud Product set up by an Atlassian customer, the&nbsp;User Notice&nbsp;governs your access and use of the Cloud Product (and not these Terms).&nbsp.
These Terms are between you and the Atlassian entity that owns or operates the Cloud Product that you are using or accessing listed here&nbsp;(<strong>“Atlassian”</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>“we”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>).&nbsp.
<strong>“You”</strong> means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually.&nbsp.
If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms.
(ii) you have read and understand these Terms.
and (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent.
If you don’t have the legal authority to bind your employer or the applicable entity please do not click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.&nbsp.
<strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, THEN (A) YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT SUCH PARTY, (B) YOUR CLICK TO ACCEPT WILL BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND (C) THE WORD “YOU” IN THESE TERMS WILL REFER TO YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>These Terms are effective as of the date you first click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) or use or access a Cloud Product, whichever is earlier (the “Effective Date”).
These Terms do not have to be signed in order to be binding.
You indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Cloud Product, create a Cloud Product account, or place an Order.&nbsp;For No-Charge Products, you also indicate your assent to these Terms by accessing or using the applicable No-Charge Product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
What these Terms cover.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.1.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Cloud Products</u>.
These Terms govern our Cloud Products, related Support, and Additional Services.
These Terms include Our Policies (including our Privacy Policy), the Product-Specific Terms, and your Orders.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Product-Specific Terms</u>.&nbsp;Some Cloud Products may be subject to additional terms specific to that product as set forth in the Product-Specific Terms.
By accessing or using a product covered by the Product-Specific Terms, you also agree to the Product-Specific Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.3.</strong>
<u>Expanded Coverage Addendum</u>.
Certain qualifying Cloud Products are also subject to the Expanded Coverage Addendum, as specified in such terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.4.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Software Products Not Covered</u>.
These Terms do not apply to our downloadable software products (currently designated as “Server” and “Data Center” deployments), use of which requires a separate license agreement with us.
For clarity, however, any client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) we provide as part of the Cloud Products themselves remains subject to these Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
How Cloud Products are administered.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.1.</strong>
<u>Administrators</u>.
Through the Cloud Products, you may be able to specify certain End Users as Administrators, who will have important rights and controls over your use of Cloud Products and End User Accounts.
This may include making Orders for Cloud Products or enabling Apps (which may incur fees).
creating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions.
and managing access to Your Data by End Users or others.
Administrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to your domain (which become “managed accounts”, as described in our Documentation).
Without limiting Section 2.4 (Responsibility for End Users), which fully applies to Administrators, you are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above.
You agree that our responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Products for you.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Reseller as Administrator</u>.
If you order Cloud Products through a Reseller, then you are responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in your applicable agreement with the Reseller.&nbsp.
As between you and Atlassian, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other End User Accounts.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3.</strong>&nbsp;<u>End User Consent</u>.&nbsp;You will provide all required disclosures to and will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Administrators to have the access described in these Terms and the Privacy Policy.
and (ii) Atlassian’s provision of the Cloud Products to Administrators and End Users.
You will provide evidence of such consents upon our reasonable request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>2.4.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Responsibility for End Users</u>.
Our Cloud Products have various user onboarding flows.
Some Cloud Products require users to be designated by Administrators.
some allow users to sign up for individual accounts which can become associated with teams or organizations at a later time.
and some may allow users to invite other users.
You are responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Product you use and for controlling whom you allow to become an End User.
If payment is required for End Users to use or access a Cloud Product, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Products to those End Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such End Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Products.
Some Cloud Products may allow you to designate different types of End Users (for example, Jira Service Management&nbsp;distinguishes between “agents” and “customers”), in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of End User.
You are responsible for compliance with these Terms by all End Users, including for any payment obligations.
Please note that you are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including Orders they may place and how End Users use Your Data, even if those End Users are not from your organization or domain.
We may display our User Notice&nbsp;to End Users at sign up, account creation, Cloud Product registration, or in-product.
If you use&nbsp;single sign-on (SSO) for identity management of your Cloud Product(s) such that End Users will bypass these screens and our User Notice, you are responsible for displaying our User Notice&nbsp;to End Users and for any damages resulting from your failure to do so.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.5.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Credentials</u>.&nbsp;You must require that all End Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Cloud Products strictly confidential and do not share such information with any unauthorized person.
User IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared.
You are responsible for any and all actions taken using End User Accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.6.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Age Requirement for End Users</u>.&nbsp;The Cloud Products are not intended for, and should not be used by, anyone under the age of 16.
You are responsible for ensuring that all End Users are at least 16 years old.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.7.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Domain Name Ownership</u>.&nbsp;Where you are required to specify a domain for the operation of a Cloud Product or certain Cloud Product features, we may verify that you own or control that domain.
If you do not own or control the domain you specify, then we will have no obligation to provide you with the Cloud Product or Cloud Product features.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.

Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, we have no liability under these Terms for Sensitive Personal Information submitted in violation of the foregoing.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.4.</strong>
<u>Your Indemnity</u>.&nbsp;You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless us (and our Affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees) from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from any claim arising from or related to (i) your breach of Section 2.3 (End User Consent) or any claims or disputes brought by your End Users arising out of their use of Cloud Products, (ii) your breach (or alleged breach) of Sections 5.2 (Your Data Compliance Obligations) or 5.3 (No Prohibited Sensitive Personal Information).

We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of removals and suspensions when practicable, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Cloud Product or other users, we may suspend your access or remove Your Data immediately without notice.

Your receipt or use of any third party products or services (and the third parties’ use of any of Your Data) is subject to a separate agreement between you and the third party provider.
If you enable or use third party products or services with the Cloud Products (including Third Party Apps as referenced in Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)), we will allow the third party providers to access or use Your Data as required for the interoperation of their products and services with the Cloud Products.
This may include transmitting, transferring, modifying or deleting Your Data, or storing Your Data on systems belonging to the third party providers or other third parties.

Atlassian Apps for Cloud Products are considered “Cloud Products” under these Terms (unless we specify otherwise through the Atlassian Marketplace).
Third Party Apps are not Cloud Products and remain subject to their own applicable Vendor Terms.
We may enable interoperation of the Cloud Products with Third Party Apps as set forth in Section 6.1 (Third-Party Products).
The terms <strong>“Apps”</strong>, <strong>“Atlassian Apps”</strong>, <strong>“Third Party Apps”</strong>, <strong>“Vendor”</strong> and <strong>“Vendor Terms”</strong> are defined in the Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use, which is a separate agreement governing use of the Atlassian Marketplace.</p>

You may use any of Our Deliverables provided to you only in connection with the Cloud Products, subject to the same usage rights and restrictions as for the Cloud Products.

<p>
<strong>8.3.</strong>
<u>Your Materials</u>.&nbsp;You agree to provide us with reasonable access to Your Materials as reasonably necessary for our provision of Additional Services.
If you do not provide us with timely access to Your Materials, our performance of Additional Services will be excused until you do so.

<p>
<strong>8.4.</strong>
<u>Training Not Covered</u>.&nbsp;Your purchase, and our provision, of Training is subject to our Training Terms and Policies, which is a separate agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>9.
Billing, renewals, and payment.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.1.</strong>
<u>Monthly and Annual Plans</u>.
Except for No-Charge Products, all Cloud Products are offered either on a monthly subscription basis or an annual subscription basis.</p>
<p>
<strong>9.2.</strong>
<u>Renewals</u>.&nbsp;Except as otherwise specified in your Order, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to expiration of the current Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term of a period equal to your initial Subscription Term.
You will provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which may include account settings in the Cloud Products or contacting our support team.
Cancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged.
All renewals are subject to the applicable Cloud Product continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.</p>
<p>
<strong>9.3.</strong>
<u>Adding Users</u>.&nbsp;You may add users, increase storage limits, or otherwise increase your use of Cloud Products by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, we will charge you for any increased use at our then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>
<p>
<strong>9.4.</strong>
<u>Payment</u>.&nbsp;You will pay all fees in accordance with each Order, by the due dates and in the currency specified in the Order.
If a PO number is required in order for an invoice to be paid, then you must provide such PO number to Atlassian by emailing the PO number to accountsreceivable@atlassian.com.
For Additional Services provided at any non-Atlassian location, unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will reimburse us for our pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses, which we may charge as incurred.
Other than as expressly set forth in Section 10 (Our return policy), 18.3 (Warranty Remedy), Section 20 (IP Indemnification) or Section 24 (Changes to these Terms), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable.
You agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>
<p>
<strong>9.5.</strong>
<u>Delivery</u>.&nbsp;We will deliver the login instructions for Cloud Products to your&nbsp;account or through other reasonable means no later than when we have received payment of the applicable fees.
You are responsible for accessing your account to determine that we have received payment and that your Order has been processed.
All deliveries under these Terms will be electronic.</p>
<p>
<strong>10.
Our return policy.&nbsp;</strong>As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty in Section 18 (Warranties and Disclaimer), you may terminate your initial Order of a Cloud Product under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing notice of termination to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such Cloud Product.
In the event you terminate your initial Order under this Section 10, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the amount paid under such Order.
This termination and refund right applies only to your initial Order of the Cloud Product and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not apply to Additional Services.
You understand that we may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 24 (Changes to these Terms).</p>
<p>
<strong>11.
Taxes not included.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>11.1.</strong>
<u>Taxes</u>.
Your fees under these Terms exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received.
To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by us, you must pay to us the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under these Terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed, you may provide us with such exemption information, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with invoicing documents designed to enable you to obtain a refund or credit from the relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.2.</strong>
<u>Withholding Taxes</u>.&nbsp;You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes.
You and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available.
If we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof.
You will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.</p>
<p>
<strong>12.
If you purchased through a Reseller.
</strong> If you make any purchases through an&nbsp;authorized partner or reseller of Atlassian (<strong>“Reseller”</strong>):</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;Instead of paying us, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller.
We may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Products if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Products you are entitled to use, the number of End Users, the Subscription Term, etc.) will be as stated in the Order placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order as communicated to us.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;If you are entitled to a refund under these Terms, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;Resellers are not authorized to modify these Terms or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth in these Terms.</p>
<p>(e) The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to us for your use of the applicable Cloud Product under these Terms will be deemed the amount actually paid or payable by you to us under these Terms for purposes of calculating the liability cap in Section 19.2.</p>
<p>
<strong>13.
No contingencies on other products of future functionality.&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge that the Cloud Products and Additional Services referenced in an Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services.
Payment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other products (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Products and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order).
You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Products beyond the current Subscription Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.</p>
<p>
<strong>14.
Evaluations, trials, and betas.</strong> We may offer certain Cloud Products (including some Atlassian Apps) to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, <strong>“No-Charge Products”</strong>).
Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or, if not designated, until terminated in accordance with these Terms).
Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 14, the terms and conditions of these Terms governing Cloud Products, including Section 3.3 (Restrictions), fully apply to No-Charge Products.
We may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.
You understand that any pre-release and beta Cloud Products, and any pre-release and beta features within generally available Cloud Products, that we make available (collectively, “<strong>Beta Versions</strong>”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Cloud Products.
We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available.
In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 14.
All information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support, warranty and indemnity obligations.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THESE TERMS, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS WILL BE US$100.</p>
<p>
<strong>15.
IP Rights in the Cloud Products and Feedback.</strong> Cloud Products are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”.
We and our licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Our Technology (including the Cloud Products).
From time to time, you may choose to submit Feedback to us.
We may in connection with any of our products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.
No Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in these Terms limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>
<p>
<strong>16.
Confidentiality.</strong> Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (<strong>“Receiving Party”</strong>) by the disclosing party (<strong>"Disclosing Party"</strong>) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (<strong>“Confidential Information”</strong>), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.
Any of Our Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Products will be deemed our Confidential Information without any marking or further designation.
Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms.
The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 16 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by them with the terms of this Section 16.
The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.
(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.
(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.
or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.
The Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).
The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>
