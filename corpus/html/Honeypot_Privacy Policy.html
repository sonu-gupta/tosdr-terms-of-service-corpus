f)
GDPR.</p>
How does Honeypot use my personal data?
<p>Honeypot uses the data for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing the services you requested, e.g.
matching you with other members of
our service.</li>
<li>Making certain that you have the best possible user experience, e.g.
edit your
profile and manage your privacy settings.</li>
<li>Honoring our contractual obligations to you, e.g.
inform you about possible
connections (Interview Invites) via the platform, email or phone.</li>
<li>Enabling you to participate in our interactive service as far as you like.</li>
<li>To inform you about changes to our service.</li>
</ul>
<p>On our website you can set up an account to use our services in form of an
online job marketplace platform.
In case you sign up as a candidate (“Talent”),
you are required to enter your personal data such as name and e-mail,.
In
addition, you need to add languages and other skills, employment and education
history as well as location to create an account.
You can also sign up with your
LinkedIn or Github account (for further information please see provisions about
social media plug-ins below).
In this case, further information may be required,
such as name, photo, current position, etc.
Honeypot can contact the Talent to
determine further information required and update the profile accordingly.
Signing up as an employer requires to enter the company name, hiring location,
number of employees, contact person and contact e-mail.
The information required
for the implementation of the contract relationship will be processed for this
purpose only.
In most cases, companies access the profiles of Talents by
themselves on the platform after searching for certain skills and contact the
Talent directly.
Furthermore, however, Honeypot can contact the Talent or the
employer via phone, email or messaging service and suggest companies which fit
the Talent´s profile or suggest Talents which fit the company´s profile.
The
legal basis of this processing is Art.
6 (1) sentence 1 lit.
b) GDPR.
A storage
of data can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>The specified data and your entire user account can always be deleted in the
customer area.
You agree to treat personal access data confidentially and not to
make such data available to unauthorized third parties.
We do not assume
liability for misused passwords unless we are responsible for the abuse.
You
should notify us immediately if you are concerned about a third party having
knowledge of your password, if the password is used unauthorized or this seems
to be likely.
You are responsible for ensuring that your information is accurate
and complete and that you notify us of any changes to the information provided.
You can review and update the information provided and your account settings
section of our website.

personal data transferred (e.g.
payment data) for a period of 10 years.
After a
period of [e.g.
2 years] we restrict the use of specific data and, as a
consequence, the data may be used to comply with legal obligations only.</p>
Does Honeypot transfer data to third parties?
<p>We transmit your personal data to third parties only if you have consented to
the transfer, if the transfer is necessary for the performance of the contract,
or we are enforced to do so by law.</p>
<p>Companies we cooperate with to mediate the Talent and try to match the right
person with the right job have access to profiles of the Talents and therefore
personal data of Talents are transmitted to the companies as a result.
The
companies are only allowed to process these personal data within the framework
of the application process (especially save the data in their applicant tracking
system) and to contact the Talent in case there are interested.
The legal basis
of this processing is Art.
6 (1) sentence 1 lit.
b) and f) GDPR.</p>
<p>We sometimes use external service providers to process your personal data and to
provide our services.
They are carefully chosen and instructed by us.
They are
bound by our instructions and are regularly inspected.
The data provided to our
service providers may be used by them to fulfill their tasks only.</p>
<p>In particular, Honeypot transfers personal data to service providers to be able
to create and publish Talent profiles on the platform, to proof the Talent´s
qualification, to invite Talents to online interviews with companies or with
Honeypot, to ensure communication between Talents and companies and between
Talents and Honeypot and to help Talents and companies with the Visa process.</p>
<p>In order to improve the services of Honeypot and to assess on whether a contract
between Talent and Company will take place soon, Honeypot is able to access the
communication between Talent and Company on the platform.</p>
<p>If we transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will
do so only if the EU Commission has decided that the third country ensures an
adequate level of data protection or other appropriate safeguards exist (e.g.
EU
standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules) or a person has given
its consent to do so.</p>

Does Honeypot use Google Adwords?
<p>Honeypot uses Google Adwords to draw attention to our offers by using
advertising materials (so-called Google Adwords) on external websites.
In
relation to the data of the advertising campaigns, we can determine how
successful the individual advertising measures are.
We are interested in showing
you advertisements that are of interest to you, to make our website more
interesting to you and to achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.</p>
<p>These advertising materials are supplied by Google via so-called "ad servers".
Therefore, we use ad server cookies, which measure certain performance metrics
such as ads or user clicks.
If you access our website through a Google ad,
Google Adwords will store a cookie on your PC.
These cookies usually lose their
validity after 30 days and are not intended to identify you personally.
Typically, the unique cookie ID, number of ad impressions per placement
(frequency), last impression (relevant to post-view conversions), and opt-out
information (mark that the user does not like to be addressed) will be saved.</p>
<p>These cookies allow Google to recognize your internet browser.
If a user visits
certain pages of an Adwords customer's website and the cookie stored on their
computer has not expired, Google and the customer will be able to detect that
the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to that page.
Each Adwords
customer is assigned a different cookie.
Cookies cannot be tracked via the
websites of Adwords customers.
Honeypot does not collect and process any
personal data in the aforementioned advertising measures.
We receive only
statistical evaluations by Google.
On the basis of these evaluations, we can
identify which of the advertising measures used are effective.
We do not receive
any further data from the use of the advertising material, in particular we
cannot identify the users on the basis of this information.</p>
<p>Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct
connection to the Google server.
We have no control over the extent and the
further use of the data, which are raised by the appliance of this tool by
Google.
Therefore we inform you according to our knowledge level: By the
incorporation of AdWords conversion Google receives the information that you
entered the appropriate part of our internet appearance or click on an ad from
us.
If you are registered with a service provided by Google, Google may
associate the visit with your account.
Even if you are not registered with
Google or have not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will find and
store your IP address.</p>
<p>You can prevent participation in this tracking process in several ways: a) by
adjusting your browser software accordingly, in particular, suppression of
third-party cookies will prevent you from receiving any third party
advertisements.
b) by deactivating the cookies for conversion tracking by
setting your browser to block cookies from the domain "www.googleadservices.com"
under https://www.google.de/settings/ads.
However, this setting will be deleted
when you delete your cookies.
c) by deactivating the interest-based ads of
providers that are part of the self-regulation "About Ads" campaign via the link
http: http://www.aboutads.info/ choices, however this setting will be deleted
when you delete your cookies.
d) by permanent deactivation in your browser
(Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome) under the link
http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin.
We point out that in this case you
may not be able to use all the features of our offer.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art.

Does Honeypot use Social-Media-Plug-ins?
<p>Honeypot currently uses the following social media plug-ins on our website:
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Github.</p>
<p>Honeypot uses the so-called two-click solution.
This means that, by visiting our
website, no personal data is initially passed on to providers of such plug-ins.</p>
<p>The provider of the plug-in can be identified on our website by the
corresponding logo via the respective button.
We provide the opportunity to
communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in.
The plug-in provider only
receives the information that you have accessed its website via our online
service, if you click on the designated field and activate it.
Furthermore, the
information according to access and cookies of this Privacy Policy will be
transmitted.</p>
<p>In Germany, according to the information of the respective provider when using
Facebook plug-ins the IP address will be anonymized immediately after
collection.</p>
<p>Please note that through activation of the plug-in personal data will be
transferred about you to the respective plug-in provider (in case of US
providers to the USA).
Data collection is mainly done by plug-in providers via
cookies.
So we recommend to delete all cookies on the security settings of your
browser before clicking on the button.</p>
<p>We have no influence on the collected data and the data processing operations.
We are also not aware of the full scope of the data collection, the purpose of
the processing and the storage periods.
In addition, we have no information on
the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.</p>
<p>The respective plug-in provider stores the data collected about you in profiles
and uses them for marketing, market research and/or tailored design of its
website.
Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (also for non-logged-in
users) for the presentation of tailor-made advertising and to inform other users
of the social network about your activities on our website.
You have a right to
object against the creation of such usage profiles.
To exercise, you need to
contact the respective plug-in provider.
The plug-ins allow us to interact with
social networks and other users so that we can improve our offer and make it
more interesting for you.
The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art.
6
(1) sentence 1 lit.
f) GDPR.</p>
<p>A transfer of data takes place regardless of whether you have an account with
the plug-in provider and are logged-in .
However, if you are logged in to the
plug-in provider, your data collected from us will be assigned directly to your
user account.
If you activate the social media button and, for example, link the
page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and
shares it publicly with your contacts.
For this reason, we recommend to log out
regularly after using a social network, but especially before activating the
button, as this will prevent you from being assigned to your profile with the
plug-in provider.</p>
<p>For more information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and its
processing by the plug-in provider, please refer to the privacy statements of
the relevant provider, which are provided below.
You will also get further
information about your rights and settings options to protect your privacy.</p>
