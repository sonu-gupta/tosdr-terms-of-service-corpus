W.
Norton &amp.
Company, Inc., including its subsidiaries and certain affiliates (collectively “Norton,” “we,” or “us”), values your trust in us and cares about your privacy and security online.
This privacy policy (the “Policy”) describes our privacy and data collection practices (the “Practices”) and contains important information about the choices available to you when you interact with us through our websites, social media pages, online newsletters, and other online interfaces owned and operated by us (each a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”) that link to this Policy.
This Policy also applies to information that we may receive outside of the Sites, including for example, from publicly available databases, social media platforms, and authors and other third parties who may share such information in connection with joint marketing campaigns.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a student, this Policy also applies to information (“Student Data”) we collect from you or from your school and maintain on your school’s behalf in connection with assigned coursework that utilizes any of our online platforms, tools or systems.
Examples of Student Data include campus email addresses, class lists, platform usage, and learning outcomes such as test results.
We use Student Data in compliance with all applicable privacy and data protection laws, including the Family and Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA), and the requirements of each of our institutional partners.
We do not use personally identifying information in School Data for targeted advertising.
Please review the School Data Privacy section of this Policy for more information about our treatment of Student Data and contact your school for details about its use of your personal information.</p>
<p>By using our Sites, you are accepting the Practices described in the Policy.
We may supplement the Practices from time to time by posting additional or superseding terms on specific Sites in connection with particular features of those Sites or in connection with particular online services or applications.
If you continue to use the Sites after we post changes, you will be deemed to have accepted the changes.
Please do not use our Sites if you do not agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Policy, or if you do not understand any aspect of the Policy, the Practices, or any other terms you find posted on any of the Sites.
This Policy does not apply to information that we may collect offline, for example over the phone, by mail, or in person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18 AND NOT ENROLLED IN ANY ACADEMIC COURSE THAT REQUIRES SUBMISSION OF CLASS WORK OR HOMEWORK VIA A SITE, YOU MUST HAVE THE PERMISSION OF A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN BEFORE YOU MAY ACCESS OR INTERACT WITH ANY OF THE SITES.

<strong>
<u>Personally Identifying and Non-Personally Identifying Information Distinguished</u>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Personally identifying information is information that individually identifies you (for example, your name, address, email address, or telephone number), as well as other information that is associated with you and may be used to locate, identify or contact you.
Non-personally identifying information (for example, your age, gender, or 5-digit zip code, unless applicable law provides otherwise) is information that does not personally identify you but may contain demographics such as your area of residence or your interests (as suggested by your uses of the Sites).</p>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Our Collection of Personally Identifying Information</u>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect personally identifying information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly from you, when you elect to participate in activities within the Sites.
For example, we may ask you to provide your personally identifying information when you register for an account on the Sites, participate in social media events involving our books or authors, sign up to receive email newsletters from us, make a purchase on the Sites, enter a contest or sweepstakes, participate in surveys or special promotions, submit content on any part of the Sites where user-generated submissions are permitted, or knowingly identify yourself to us in order to request a specific interaction with us (for example, by submitting a job application or a help desk request or similar request for customer service).<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>From your school, if you are a student or instructor.
For example, your name and/or school email address may appear on a class list we receive from an educational institution at which you have registered to take a course that uses one or more of our platforms.
If you are a student, we may collect such information as your roster of courses.
&nbsp;if you are an instructor, we may collect information about what subjects and classes you teach.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>From our Sites or from third parties who provide data and/or help us analyze transactions on our Sites in order to assess how customers are engaging with our products and services.
For example, we may use automatic forms of data collection such as cookies to determine your browsing preferences, purchase history, the length of time you spend on the Sites, and similar information.
We treat information collected in this manner as Personally Identifying Information when we are able to use it, alone or in association with other data, to determine or infer your identity.
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
<strong>
<u>Our Collection of Non-Personally Identifying Information</u>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifying Information may be automatically collected by us (and our third-party providers) when you interact with the Sites or with emails you receive from us.
For example, both we and our third-party providers may use technologies that automatically collect information about your computer or another device you use to access the Sites.
Examples of this kind of information are IP addresses, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser types, browser languages, and other transactional information.
We may also collect information about how you use the Sites via log files, clickstream data, reading history based on the pages you view, search terms and results, and other “traffic data” such as times and dates of access, software crash reports, session identification numbers and referring website addresses.
If you choose to enable the location feature, some of our applications may deliver content based on your location, and the location information will be stored on your device and used by the app.
If you choose to save a location-based search in your history, we will also store that information on our servers.
We will not collect or store location information if you don’t enable the location-based service, or if an app does not include the location-based feature.
Subject to applicable law, by using our Sites, you consent to the use of tracking technologies as described in this section.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<u>More Information About Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies</u>
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies: The term “cookie” refers to a small text file that may be stored on your computer, phone, or other device when you visit certain web pages.
Web browser settings can usually be changed to decline cookies, although this option may result in limitations on your ability to access or use the Sites.
Most web browsers’ default settings accept cookies automatically, and if you do not change that setting we and our third-party service providers may place, view and/or use cookies, web beacons, local storage objects or similar technologies to learn about your use of the Sites and other websites, including information about web pages you view, links you click, and other actions you take on our Sites.
You should also be aware that cookies may be used to track responses to online advertising.

<br>
</li>
<li>A local storage object stores information on your computer or device about how you use our Sites, products and services.
We use local storage objects and web beacons to analyze how our customers and other visitors to our Sites engage with us and how we can improve, including by customizing our products, services and offerings.

<strong>
<u>How We Use the Information We Collect When You Make Purchases on or Through Our Sites</u>
</strong>
</p>
<p>When you make purchases on or through the Sites, you provide certain transactional information to us and to third parties such as transaction processors and financial institutions.
We use the information you provide in this connection primarily for the purpose of processing the transaction, but we may also use it for other lawful purposes including creating and managing your account, evaluating and improving our services, determining the effectiveness of our marketing, and performing certain forms of market and consumer research.
Where other third parties, such as vendors who supply our software or perform web hosting and other services for the Sites, have access to your personally identifying information, they may not use such information for any purpose other than to provide services in connection with the Sites, unless they receive express permission from you.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Information We Share With Others</u>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We may share your Personally Identifying Information as follows:</p>
<p>With your school, if you are a student, an instructor, or an individual otherwise affiliated with an educational institution.
For example, we may provide your school with information about the ways in which its students and instructors interact with our educational products and platforms, including information that compares instructors and students within the school.</p>
<p>With instructors and school administrators, if you are a student.</p>
<p>With the service providers we use to perform functions (such as hosting, billing, marketing, analytics, customer service and fraud protection on our behalf), subject to such providers’ obligation to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information and to use it for no purpose other than in accordance with our instructions to provide the requested services.</p>
<p>With third-party partners who provide services to you through the Sites, to the extent that you have authorized such sharing or have formed a relationship with the such partner, to permit your use of certain products or services and/or to validate the referrals and operate the platforms.
For example, we may share your information, including certain personally identifying information, with the third-party provider of an application that enables certain functionalities on the Sites, depending on your preferences as expressed in the privacy settings you choose.
Such third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Policy, will govern their use of information we share with them.</p>
<p>As necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which may include laws and regulations outside of your country of residence, and as required or appropriate to cooperate with law enforcement and government or other public authorities.</p>

<p>We may share your Non-Personally Identifying Information in any way that we deem necessary or appropriate.
For example, information that we have aggregated and/or anonymized in such a way that it can no longer be used to identify you or anyone else may be used by us for our own or others’ research purposes, or to generate further data for our own use or that of third parties.<br>
<br>

<u>Targeted Advertising</u>
</strong>
</p>

The technologies used for these purposes are not under our control and are not subject to this Policy.
Although we do not share your Personally Identifying Information with these third parties, it is possible that, by analyzing the data they collect on our Sites and comparing it with data from other sources, they may be able to personally identify you.

Although we do not share your Personally Identifying Information with social media platforms, a platform to which you have previously provided Personally Identifying Information (e.g., by setting up an account) may be able to identify you, and collect additional information about your activities online, when you interact with them through links on our Sites.
We have no control over the way in which your information may be used by any third-party site with which you choose to interact, and we are not responsible for any act or failure to act of any social media service provider, platform or service with which you may choose to interact, including through links available on our Sites.</p>

<u>School Data Privacy</u>

<p>We take seriously the privacy of enrolled students (each a “Student” and collectively “Students”) who interact with our Sites in connection with the services we provide to universities, colleges and schools (each a “School” and collectively “Schools”) including Students who use our products or services as part of a School course adoption.
Notwithstanding any otherwise applicable Practice described in this Policy, we do not use Students’ Personally Identifying Information for our own marketing or advertising purposes, except to the extent that we may notify Students of products or services we offer that are related, or may be relevant, to their coursework or to products or services they are already using.

&nbsp;Student information received by us from third parties will be held by us in accordance with this Policy, but the actions of Schools and third parties with respect to Student information are governed by such parties’ own privacy policies, for which we are not responsible.
&nbsp;Where we provide services to a School, including by making our publications and other products available for course adoption, we may share Student data (including class work, homework responses, test scores, and the like) and information with authorized faculty, administrators and other School officials in connection with our provision of services to the School and to permit instructors and other authorized School personnel to review Student work, monitor progress and otherwise support instruction.
&nbsp;We may also use Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect from and about Students for our own analytic purposes, to better understand how our products and services are accessed and used and to improve them, and we may develop and share with third parties analyses containing aggregated (Non-Personally Identifying) information for purposes of describing, marketing and selling our educational products and services.

&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact your School directly if you have any questions about the School’s LMS or its policies in connection with the restrictions on disclosure of Student information pursuant to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”).

We will not, however, materially change our Practices in any way that would make them less protective of personally identifying information we have previously collected from you unless we obtain your express consent to do so.
Please check the “effective date” above to see when this Policy was last revised.
Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Sites.
