<p>The handling of the decorative weapons sold by us is subject to, amongst others, the restrictions of the German Weapons Act (Deutsches Waffengesetz).

With a few exceptions, the carrying of the decorative pieces offered in public is prohibited.</p>
11.

11.1 Tickets and Vouchers for Services of other Providers
<p>Where tickets for events are offered in the web shop, we are not the organisers of those events.
Tickets ordered are excluded from the right of revocation! We can cancel the ticket purchase if you breach the event conditions or if you try to circumvent them.
The revocation/withdrawal can also be declared by crediting the amounts paid.</p>
11.2 Shopping Vouchers / Promotional Code
<p>You may not pay for a shopping voucher with a voucher.
Shopping vouchers are only redeemable in the EMP-App and on the internet pages listed under the section "Our Online Shops" .
Shopping vouchers can also be redeemed partially if the redeeming client has a customer account.
Shopping vouchers must be redeemed within three years after the end of the year in which they were purchased.
Only one promotional code can be applied per order.
The equivalent value of a shopping voucher / promotional code cannot be paid out in cash or offset against other claims.
Promotional codes can be bound to a minimum order value which you have to reach with your purchase.
If you subsequently fall below the minimum order value, e.g.
by returning part of your order, the advantage of the promotional code shall lapse.</p>
12.
Backstage Club
12.1 Conclusion of Agreement and Membership
<p>You can use the advantages of the Backstage Club in the EMP-App and on the internet pages listed under the section "Our Online Shops" .
To become a member you will need an EMP customer account.
A membership cannot be transferred to another customer account.
You can apply for the membership by ordering the "Backstage Club" as an article in our web shop and by us confirming receipt of the order in accordance with Clause 2.
The voluntary take-back guarantee of EMP shall not apply to membership of the Backstage Club.
The statutory right of revocation shall remain unaffected.
</p>
12.2 Advantages for Members
<p>Online orders are free of shipping costs for you.
Please note: Other fees such as charges for cash on delivery or fees for age verification will remain payable.
Our voluntary take-back guarantee shall be extended to 100 days.
</p>
12.3 Duration and Notice of Termination
<p>The Backstage Club membership is valid for the minimum term stated upon conclusion.
If neither party terminates the membership, your membership will be automatically extended by the respective minimum term.
Each party can terminate the membership with a notice period of one day to the end of the respective term.
The termination is possible either in the "My Account" ("Mein Konto") section or via contacting our customer service using the contact options indicated here.
</p>
<p>In addition, we can terminate the membership with a notice period of 3 months if we cease to offer the Backstage Club service.
You can terminate your membership without notice if we more than merely marginally restrict the advantages for members, who are an integral part of the Backstage Club.
If your membership thereby ends before the expiry of the respective term, the membership fees will be refunded to you pro rata.
Additionally, both parties have the right to terminate the membership without notice for good cause.
A good cause in our view exists if you delete your customer account, if you place fraudulent orders or if you commit a grave violation of the agree-ment.
In this case, there will be no refund.</p>
12.4 Gift Membership
<p>The voucher for a gift membership can only be redeemed by a third party.
Gift memberships shall automatically end upon expiry of the period stated in the voucher, unless the third party indicates in the "My Account" section or via contacting our customer service using the contact options indicated here that they want to continue their membership pursuant to Clause 12.3 following the period of the gift membership.</p>
12.5 Fees
<p>You can find the annually payable membership fee for the membership in the Backstage Club in the price table below.
We will automatically collect the membership fee due on an annual basis using the payment method indicated.
If this payment method becomes invalid during your membership or if the payment is otherwise refused, we will be entitled to switch the payment method automatically to another payment method indicated in your EMP customer account.
</p>
12.6 Change to the Participation Conditions
<p>We are entitled to change these participation conditions.
If we do so, we will inform you in due time and notify you of any such changes.
You can then object to the changes within one month.
If you do not object, the changed participation conditions will apply after one month.
When notifying you of the changes, we will also inform you of your right of objection and the conse-quences of the expiry of the term.</p>
13.
Free Articles
<p>The ownership of free articles will only pass to you upon expiry of the revocation period and the voluntary take-back term (retention of title).
If extras are linked to a minimum order value, the minimum order value shall refer to one order and must be reached by this single order even after exercising the statutory rights of revocation or the contractual return rights.
If the purchase value of your order falls below the respective minimum order value by virtue of exercising a statutory right of revocation or a contractual return right, then the extra for this purchase must also be sent back with the return of the goods.
In this case, an entitlement to other extras shall not arise.</p>
