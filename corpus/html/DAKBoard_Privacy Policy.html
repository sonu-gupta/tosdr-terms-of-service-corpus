</ul> European Union Users
Data protection law in Europe requires a “lawful basis” for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area.
Our lawful bases include: <ul>
<li>Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services.</li>
<li>Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data.
For example, tax laws require us to retain records of payments made through our Services.</li>
<li>Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights.
We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
<br>
<br>
For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services secure.
We may also send you promotional communications about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.
<br>
<br>
We analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well.
This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.
</li>
</ul> How This Information Is Shared Information that’s shared publicly
DAKboard does not share any information publicly.
<br>

<li>Your IP address;</li>
<li>Your phone number;</li>
<li>Private profile information, in accordance with your preferences.
and</li>
<li>Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem).</li>
</ul> Information that’s shared with trusted third-party services
We may share your information with certain trusted third-party services to help us provide, improve, promote, or protect DAKboard’s Services (like when we partner with payment processors).
When we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the DAKboard Services, we require that they use your information only for the purposes we’ve authorized, and that they protect your personal information at least to the same standards we do.
We may also share information that’s aggregated and anonymized in a way that it doesn’t directly identify you.
Information that’s shared to protect DAKboard and comply with the law
We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect DAKboard’s legal rights, property, or the safety of DAKboard, its employees, users, or others.
Links to other websites and services
Our Site may include links to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from DAKboard’s.
When you use a link to an external site or service, the privacy policy and data processing disclosures for that site or service governs.

<br>
<br>
We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Site, improve our Services or comply with legal obligations.
Data Transfers
Because DAKboard is a US-based company, your information will be collected and processed in the United States.
The United States has its own laws governing data protection and government access to information.

If you choose to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between DAKboard and its users.

Your account information is protected by a password, which you should choose carefully and keep secure.
