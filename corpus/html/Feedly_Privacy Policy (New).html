<li>If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Site, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not).
We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity.
In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice.
These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary.
We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.</li>
<li>We may also collect personal information, such as at other points in our Service that state that personal information is being collected.</li>
</ul>(b) Information You Provide to Facebook and other Social Networking Sites<p>The Services allow users to access Facebook to interact with friends and to share on Facebook and/or Google+ through friends’ news feeds.
When you click on “Personalize with Facebook,” or a similar connection on another social networking service (each, an “<b>SNS</b>”), you will be prompted to enter your SNS credentials or to “Sign Up” for the SNS.
By proceeding, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook or other SNS’s Terms of Use in your use of the Services.
In this case, we may receive information from Facebook or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site and show our relevant content from your Facebook or SNS friends.
Once you register on the Site and connect with Facebook or another SNS, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook or the other SNS.
Any information that we collect from your Facebook or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices.
You have the option to disable the connection between the Services and your SNS account at any time by logging into your Account through the Site and going to settings, “About Me,” “Linked Accounts,” and then unselecting your SNS.</p>(c) Information Collected via Technology<ul>

As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“<b>ISP</b>”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.

Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.
“<b>Cookies</b>” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.

In addition, we use “<b>Pixel Tagsb</b>” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).
Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies that are used to track online movements of Web users.
In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.
Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.
We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.

We use the information we get from these Analytics Companies only to improve our Site, Application and Services.

We do not combine the information generated through the use of our Analytics Companies with your personal information.
Although these Analytics Companies may plant a persistent Cookie on your web browser or mobile device to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but the Analytics Company that placed the applicable Cookie.
