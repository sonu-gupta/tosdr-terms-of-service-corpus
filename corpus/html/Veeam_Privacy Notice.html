<p>
<i>Your GDPR and California Privacy Rights.</i>

<p>
<i>
<u>Veeam does not “sell” your Personal Information.</u>

<p>Finally, under the CCPA you may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf.
If you choose to do that, we may seek additional information to ensure that you have actually designated the agent to make the request.</p> Data Security Veeam takes the security of Personal Information seriously.
To protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, Veeam uses risk-based technical and organizational security measures reasonably designed to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or access.
For example, Veeam has implemented strict security controls, intrusion detection software and processes to alert us in the case of a potential or actual intrusion of our information systems.
