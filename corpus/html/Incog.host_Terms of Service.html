We have some very basic rules that constitute acceptable use of our services.
This helps us maintain a quality service that can be enjoyed by all.
The first section covers our <u>Acceptable Usage Policy</u> (AUP), which states what sort of things we do not allow.
That is then followed by our <u>Terms Of Service</u>.
Are you looking for our Privacy Policy? That can be found on it's own page <u>here</u>.</p>
<p>By using our service you accept and agree to the following policies.
Please contact us if you have any questions or conncerns.</p>
<p>Last Updated: 01/23/2020</p> The following is NOT permitted.
<p>
<b>Resource Abuse:</b>
</p>
<p>This is any activity, intentional or otherwise, that consumes an abundance of system resources that negatively impacts of the quality of the service for other customers.</p>
<br>
<p>We will respond to resource abuse by suspending the account in question and reaching out to you for a solution.
We will work with you if this is happening unintentionally and help you resolve the issue.
If we discover an intentional abuse of resources then your service will remain suspended until you’re able to retrieve a backup of your data, which we supply you, so that you may move your ill-intentions elsewhere.</p>
<p>
<b>Unsolicited Communication:</b>
</p>
<p>Spamming is the use of messaging systems to send an unsolicited message (spam) to large numbers of recipients for the purpose of commercial advertising, for the purpose of non-commercial proselytizing, or for any prohibited purpose (especially the fraudulent purpose of phishing).</p>
<br>
<p>The use of our services for spamming is strictly prohibited.
Any customer discovered to be sending spam, intentional or otherwise, will have their service suspended without notice until we are able to reach you for a solution.
If discovered that the spamming is intentional, your service will remain suspended until you’re able to retrieve a backup of your data, which we supply you, so that you may move your ill-intentions elsewhere.</p>
<p>
<b>Malicious Content:</b>
</p>
<p>This will be defined as any script, code, or file that performs a harmful action, either to the user(s) affected or as a bulk action triggered by the user.
This, for the sake of ease, will be any content, code, network activity or script that would violate the laws of the United States.
This includes but is not limited to phishing sites, participating in DdoS or other network related attacks, using our services to attempt to gain unlawful access into networks, devices, or systems that you have no authority to gain access to, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Any account found to purposely be participating in the above actions will be suspended without notice, until we are able to reach you to determine if this was unintentional or intentional actions from your account.
If unintentional, we will work with you to resolve the problem.
If found to be intentional, your service will remain suspended until you’re able to retrieve a backup of your data, which we will supply you, so that you may move your ill-intentions elsewhere.</p>
<p>
<b>Content Depicting Minors Sexually:</b>
</p>
<p>Hosting, sharing or making available any images, video, or other media that depicts minors sexually (nude or non-nude) is strictly forbidden.
Any account found to be in violation of this will be immediately suspended.
If this is discovered to unintentional, we will advise you to remove the content immediately.
If it’s found to be intentional, your service will be terminated and your data removed from our servers.
We will not be put in a position where we are held liable for content such as that, and have no obligation to supply you with a backup of your data if in violation of the above rule.</p>
<p>Legal adult content is fine.
If faced with a situation where the legality is questionable, we will err on the side of caution and advise that it be removed.</p>
<p>
<b>Illegal Marketplaces:</b>
</p>
<p>Although we’re pretty libertarian, we can not in good faith knowingly allow our services to be used to host online marketplaces that deal in illegal goods or services.
You may link to them, you may review them, you may talk about them, you can do many things in regards to illegal marketplaces except host one yourself.
An illegal marketplace will be defined as any website allowing users and vendors to sign up to advertise and to purchase the sell of goods and services that would be determined to be illegal in practically every country on earth.
