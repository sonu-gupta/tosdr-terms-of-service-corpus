        <strong>Bug Bounty Programme - Bitpanda</strong>
<p>Bitpanda GmbH (Bitpanda) Bitpanda.com as Europe's leading retail exchange for buying and selling cryptocurrencies has made every effort to secure its platform and mobile applications and to eliminate all software vulnerabilities in its systems.
As part of Bitpanda's security guidelines we appreciate your cooperation in investigating and reporting any vulnerabilities of the Bitpanda Services (as defined below).
</p>
<p>This Bug Bounty Programme gives you the framework on how to act as a security researcher and be rewarded for finding and reporting bugs within the Bitpanda ecosystem (Bitpanda Bug Bounty Programme or Programme).
</p>
<strong>Scope of the Programme</strong>
<p>This section will give you an overview of the Bitpanda Bug Bounty Programme.
Please make sure you keep the ruleset in mind before investigating any issues.
Bitpanda offers rewards for significant bugs pursuant to this Programme.
</p>
<p>Bitpanda reserves the right to modify or cancel the Bitpanda Bug Programme at Bitpanda's sole discretion and at any time.
</p>
<strong>Security Researcher</strong>
<p>Every person participating in the Bitpanda Bug Bounty Programme is called a “Security Researcher”.
To be classified as a Security Researcher you must fully comply with this Programme.
Only fully compliant “Security Researchers” may get rewards according to this Programme.
</p>
<strong>Bitpanda Services</strong>
<p>The Bitpanda Bug Bounty Programme's scope covers software vulnerabilities in services by Bitpanda.
Bitpanda services and their specific domains are (Bitpanda Services): </p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<strong>Service</strong>
<strong>Domain</strong> Bitpanda https://www.bitpanda.com Bitpanda Platform https://web.bitpanda.com Bitpanda Platform API http://api.bitpanda/v1 Bitpanda Socket wss://socket.bitpanda.com Bitpanda Pro https://exchange.bitpanda.com Bitpanda Pro API https://api.exchange.bitpanda.com/public/v1 Bitpanda Pro Secure Web Sockets wss://streams.exchange.bitpanda.com Android App https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpanda.bitpanda iOS App https://apps.apple.com/app/bitpanda-buy-bitcoin-crypto/id1449018960 <p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Not part of the Bitpanda Bug Bounty Programme and explicitly out of the Programme's scope are following subdomains, hosted by third parties (Non-Bitpanda Services).
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<strong>Service</strong>
<strong>Domain</strong> Bitpanda Blog https://blog.bitpanda.com Bitpanda Magazine https://magazine.bitpanda.com Bitpanda Helpdesk https://support.bitpanda.com <p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Non-Bitpanda Services may be eligible for a bug report, if such vulnerability <em>directly leads to a relevant impact on a Bitpanda Service</em>.
</p>
<p>Additionally, all kind of other websites, software, applications etc.
are explicitly out of the Programme's scope, in particular: </p>
<ul>
<li>Websites not provided by Bitpanda </li>
<li>External websites, software, applications etc.
linking to Bitpanda </li>
<li>External websites, software, applications etc.
using Bitpanda's API </li>
<li>Websites not being Bitpanda Services or Non-Bitpanda Services as outlined above</li>
</ul>
<p>No exception is existent for external websites.
</p>
<strong>Bug Report</strong>
<p>A Bug report is a summary of your findings concerning a detected vulnerability of Bitpanda Services.
In general, a bug report must be valid, in scope report to qualify as a bug report and, hence, to qualify for a reward.
Please find the requirements for a compliant bug report under point "Complete Bug Report".
</p>
<strong>First Reporter Rule</strong>
<p>A Security Researcher reporting an issue first is called the First Reporter.
Rewards for a specific vulnerability go to the First Reporter.
A subsequent bug report reporting the same or similar vulnerability will not be eligible for a reward (first come first serve principle).
Provided that Bitpanda is already aware of a specific vulnerability at the time of a submitted bug report reporting the same or similar vulnerability as already known, Bitpanda is deemed to be the First Reporter.
</p>
<strong>Rewards</strong>
<p>Bitpanda grants rewards (also called bounty and/or bounties) for reporting software vulnerabilities in accordance with this Programme.
Rewards may be granted if the following requirements called the “Researcher Requirements” are collectively fulfilled: </p>
<ol>
<li>Responsible Investigation (description in point "Responsible Investigation").
</li>
<li>Complete Bug Report (description in point "Complete Bug Report").
</li>
<li>Eligibility of Vulnerability (description in point "Eligibility of Vulnerability").
and </li>
<li>Responsible Disclosure (description in point "Responsible Disclosure").</li>
</ol>
<p>If just one of the above requirements is not fulfilled, this has to be assessed as a non-compliance with this Programme.
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Bitpanda decides at its sole and own discretion whether a reward is granted and the exact amount of such bounty.
A granted reward will be paid to the Bitpanda fiat wallet (EUR) in the Bitpanda user account of the respective successful First Reporter.
This means that a First Reporter requires a user account on the Bitpanda platform for receiving the reward.
If a Security Researcher that is qualified as a respective First Reporter is not able to set up a user account on the Bitpanda platform (e.g.
Security Researcher holds citizenship of or is located in jurisdiction that is excluded from Bitpanda’s services due to regulatory reasons, AML/KYC considerations, etc), Bitpanda may, at its own discretion - and out of pure good will - arrange another form of granting the Reward to the successful First Reporter.
Security Reporter acknowledges and accepts, that he has no legal claim against Bitpanda for payment of any Reward in case he is not able to set up a user account on the Bitpanda platform.
</p>
<strong>Responsible Investigation</strong>
<p>Every investigation must be done responsibly.
Responsible investigation includes, but is not limited to: </p>

<li>Sharing of any gained sensitive information to any other third party is prohibited.
</li>
<li>Reports must be done without any demands, threats, ransoms or any other conditions </li>
<li>Security Researchers shall make sure that the integrity and confidentiality of the detected issues and any of Bitpanda's user data is secured and preserved</li>
</ul>
<p>Any breaking or neglection of these rules will be a violation of the Bitpanda Bug Bounty Programme.
</p>
<strong>Rewards Structure</strong>
<p>The reward that can be expected for your bug report depends on the severity of the reported vulnerability.
The table below will give you a general guideline what you can expect for your investigation efforts: </p>Vulnerability Reward in EUR (net) Critical dependent on severeness of vulnerability High 500.00 Medium 50.00 Low 5.00 <p>The above mentioned amounts are minimum bounties for each level of vulnerability.
A concrete bounty may excess the minimum amount based on the severity of the vulnerability and/or the Security Researcher's technique and reporting quality.
The granted reward will be determined by the impact on the Bitpanda Service.
</p>
<p>Previous granted bounty amounts are not considered precedent for future bounty amounts.
</p>
<strong>Evaluation of a bug report</strong>
<p>The evaluation of your complete bug report will be done solely by Bitpanda.
As mentioned the 4 researcher parameters stated out in point "Rewards" must be fulfilled to be evaluated as a valid bug report.
The impact of the found vulnerability will determine the reward as described in point "Rewards Structure.
The reported bug or vulnerability will be evaluated based on two factors: Impact and Exploitability.
</p>
<p>To give you an idea, how this works we provide you with some easy examples.
</p>
<strong>Impact</strong>
<p>Impact in general means the damage an abuser can cause.
This refers but is not limited to financial damages, functional damages, exploitation on confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive information &amp.
damages which could result in reputational damages.
</p>
<p>The scope of evaluation concerning the impact ranges from low to critical.
</p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
<p>
<em>Critical:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Manipulating funds balances (fiat or cryptocurrency) </li>
<li>Reading, changing or exporting of large amounts of sensitive data.
</li>
<li>Heavy interruption or exploitation of the Bitpanda trading engine.
</li>
<li>Heavy impact on performance and accuracy of the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Low:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaining small amounts of low sensitivity data </li>
<li>Slight impact on performance and accuracy of the platform</li>
</ul>
<strong>Exploitability</strong>
<p>Exploitability refers to the difficulty the system can be “gamed” or security measures can be bypassed.
</p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
<p>
<em>Critical:</em>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerabilities can be easily exploited without any significant roadblock </li>
<li>Vulnerabilities can be exploited without any special requirements like complicated hardware or software.
</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities which can be seen as an immediate threat</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<em>Low:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploits which are very difficult due to complicated or heavy requirements e.g.
complicated hardware or software requirements.
heavy guessing of unknown values (brute force) or </li>
<li>Exploits with a large uncertainty of success </li>
<li>Vulnerabilities which can be seen as improvements and no immediate threat</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that all these examples refer to unauthorized actions and not the normal intended functions (e.g.
data export, normal trading function) by Bitpanda.
</p>
<strong>Severity</strong>
<p>Severity is used for calculating the reward and is a combination of impact and exploitability.
</p>
<p>The formula can be seen as: </p>
<p>
<em>Impact (Damage) * Exploitability (How easy is it to repeat the damage) = Vulnerability Tier</em>
</p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
<p>
<em>Critical:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy accessible vulnerability without any major obstacle (critical exploitability) causing a major compromise (critical impact).
</li>
<li>Easy accessible vulnerability (critical exploitability) causing irreversible damage to Bitpanda or its users.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Low:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>No immediate threat (low exploitability) not heavily impacting the integrity of the system (low impact).
</li>
<li>Attack with high requirement and high uncertainty of success (low exploitability) causing a slight effect on the accuracy or performance of the system (low impact).</li>
</ul>
