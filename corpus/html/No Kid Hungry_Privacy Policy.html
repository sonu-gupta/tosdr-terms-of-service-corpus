<strong>Note to Parents About Our Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>Share Our Strength and its campaigns have a variety of programs for children.
We hope that children and parents will visit our websites,&nbsp;use our mobile apps together and participate in our programs, so they can jointly learn about the No Kid Hungry Campaign and opportunities for children to participate.
We may ask a child to provide certain information for notification and security purposes, including a parent or guardian’s email address and the child’s first name and gender.
We also may ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages.
We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.</p>
<p>Consistent with the requirements of Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with respect to any program that may be of interest to children, or in any instance where we ask for age and determine the user is age 12 or under, we will ask for a parent or guardian e-mail address before we collect information.&nbsp;<strong>If you believe your child is participating in an activity that collects personal information and you or another parent/guardian have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking your consent, please feel free to contact us at&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>info@strength.org</strong>
<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>In the event Share Our Strength wishes to collect personal information from a child, COPPA requires that we first seek a parent or guardian’s consent by email.
In the email we will explain what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, how the parent can provide consent, and how the parent can revoke consent.&nbsp;<strong>We will not use parent emails provided for parental consent purposes to market to the parent</strong>, unless the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.
If we do not receive parental consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the parent contact information and any other information collected from the child in connection with that activity.</p>
<p>On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child age 12 and under, we may need to ask for the child’s online contact information, such as an email address.
We will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.
In connection with certain programs or activities, we may collect a child’s online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once.
In such instances we will retain the child’s online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such as marketing.
Whenever we collect a child’s online contact information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address in order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the child’s information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child</p>
<p>On some occasions a child may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to “opt-out” of each communication individually.</p>
<p>We may also share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.
We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request.
(ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications.
(iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers.
or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.</p>
<p>
<strong>At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children in association with a particular program and can request that we delete from our records the personal information we have collected in connection with that account.</strong>&nbsp;Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of participation in a program.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about our collection of information from children, please contact us at&nbsp;info@strength.org.</p>
