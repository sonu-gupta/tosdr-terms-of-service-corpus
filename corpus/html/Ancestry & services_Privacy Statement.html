<strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Are Our Retention Practices?</strong>
</p>
<p>Ancestry Services are fundamentally premised on the notion that the personal voyage of self-discovery is not a one-time event and continues over lengthy periods of time—possibly lifetimes.
Additionally, and with particular regard to our subscribers and DNA customers who pay fees or purchase subscriptions, the ongoing enhancement of our collections of historical records and DNA features provide benefits and insights to our Users over time.
As a result, our retention practices reflect this ongoing value by retaining user accounts on our system until our Users inform us of their desire to delete their data or close their accounts.</p> Information Category Retention Period <strong>Account and Profile</strong> Ancestry will retain the Personal Information you provide while creating your account and your profile until such time as you ask us to delete it.
<strong>Family Tree</strong> Due to the multi-generational significance of family trees, Ancestry will retain your family tree data as needed to provide you with continuous access, updated features, and the ability to enhance your family tree.
<strong>DNA</strong> Ancestry retains your DNA Data as needed to provide you with the features and functionality you purchased (or were gifted), including continuously updated features such as DNA matches, increasingly granular ethnicity estimates and improved regions and communities, as well as new other features based on your DNA Data.
<strong>Related Brands</strong> Some of our related brands (Fold3®, Newspapers.com™, Find a Grave®, We Remember® or Archives®) have their own account logins and will retain the Personal Information you provide while creating your account and your profile as needed to provide you with continuous and updated Services until such time as you ask us to delete it.
You can delete these accounts at any time.
<strong>Usage Information</strong> We retain usage information (e.g., visits to sites) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
Once aggregated, this information ceases to be personal and will not be subject to user deletion requests.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;How Can I Delete My Personal Information?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can delete your Personal Information from Ancestry at any time.</p> Information Category How To Delete <strong>Personal Information</strong>
<p>You can delete your Personal Information from Ancestry by logging into your Account Settings.</p>
<p>If you have shared information with other Users (for example, by making your family trees public or by sharing your DNA Results directly with other Users), Ancestry will not be able to remove any copies of information that other Users may have retained, which can only be removed by your contacting the other User and asking them to delete it.</p>
<p>Please direct any request to remove information from linked archival records to the responsible archival entity.</p>

Please note that if you have agreed to our Informed Consent to Research, we will not be able to remove your Genetic Information from active or completed research projects, but we will not use it for any new research projects.</p>
<strong>General</strong> Please note that there may be some latency in deleting your Personal Information from our backup systems after it has been deleted from our production, development, analytics, and research systems.
Also, our laboratory partners may retain information they receive from us in order to comply with laws or regulations that may require them to do so, such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments regulations administered by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
Ancestry may also retain certain information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, as well as to comply with tax, payment industry, securities, and clinical regulatory compliance requirements.
<strong>Related Brands</strong> To delete information from our related brands (Fold3®, Newspapers.com™, Find a Grave®, We Remember® or Archives®), you can always contact us at the related brand and request that your Personal Information be deleted from that service.

<strong>Health Activation Information</strong>
</p>
<p>Ancestry uses your Health Activation Information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support and facilitate: <ul>
<li>The determination of eligibility for the AncestryHealth® Service.
and,</li>
<li>The patient-physician relationship with the independent physician network, which is provided as part of the AncestryHealth® Service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Process your AncestryHealth® kit and deliver personalized health reports to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Your Health History</strong>
</p>
<p>Ancestry uses Your Health History information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide information to the independent physician network so they may determine your eligibility for the test(s), and identify possible health issues or factors which may impact the results of your test.
and,</li>
<li>Deliver a personalized experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ancestry may also use Your Health History information in a de-identified format to improve, update and expand the AncestryHealth® Service.</p>

<strong>Family Health History</strong>

<p>Ancestry may use your Family Health History information to deliver a personalized experience.
Ancestry may also use your Family Health History information in a de-identified format to improve our AncestryHealth® Service and identify new product offerings.</p>
<p>
<strong>Genetic Information and Health Reports</strong>
</p>
<p>If the independent physician network partner approves your laboratory test, and, depending on which AncestryHealth® product you buy and whether we have your DNA Data from prior testing, Ancestry will either share your DNA Data, or send your sample for processing to our independent laboratory partner.
Using your DNA Data, our independent laboratory partner will generate a test result, which Ancestry, in turn, will use to provide your health report.</p>
<p>Ancestry’s independent physician network will also have access to your test result and health report.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> As addressed in our Privacy Statement, Ancestry commits not to share any Personal Information of AncestryHealth® Users with insurance companies, employers, or third party marketers.
Ancestry does not voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement.
To provide our Users with the greatest protection under the law, we require all government agencies seeking access to Ancestry customers’ data to follow a valid legal process, and do not allow law enforcement to use Ancestry’s services to investigate crimes or to identify human remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>16.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Do We Share Your Information and Who Are the Recipients?</strong>
</p>
<p>Ancestry will share your Health Activation Information, Your Health History, test results, health report, and any questions you submit through the “Submit a Question” feature with the independent physician network who has been appointed as part of the AncestryHealth® Service.
The independent physician network will use this information to determine your eligibility for the test, to review and provide oversight of the health reports, as well as to assist in providing genetic counseling services to you.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> The use of your information by the independent physician network, PWNHealth, will be subject to their Terms of Use and Notice of Privacy Practices.</p>

<p>
<strong>16.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Choices and Access to your Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>You may access your AncestryHealth® results and reports at any time, through the AncestryHealth® product.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>16.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Are Ancestry’s Retention Practices for the AncestryHealth® Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>Ancestry will retain the Personal Information you provided to the AncestryHealth® Service until you tell us to delete it.
This is to ensure that you always have access to your test results, health reports, and to the physician network service which is included as part of the AncestryHealth® Service.
