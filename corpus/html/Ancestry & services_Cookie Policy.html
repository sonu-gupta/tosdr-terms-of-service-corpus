<strong>Who sets Cookies when I use Ancestry’s Services?</strong>

<ul>
<li>First party Cookies: these Cookies are placed by Ancestry directly when you use our Services.
First party Cookies may include Cookies from Service Providers.</li>
<li>Third party Cookies: these Cookies do not belong to Ancestry.
They are owned by other companies, like Google or YouTube, and are used for site analytics and advertising purposes.
See further details below on how to manage these Cookies.
Third-party Cookies will be providing a service to Ancestry or a function to us but Ancestry cannot control how those third-party Cookies are used.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

For example, every time you visit our site we can log you in automatically, and remember your preferences.
Plus, we can keep you logged in as you move around the site and give you a personal experience.</p>

<strong>What Cookies does Ancestry use?</strong>
</p> Categories of Use Description <strong>Necessary</strong> These Cookies are essential for the operation of our Services.
These Cookies do things like ensure that your password works and you stay logged in when you move between pages on the website and help the website to remember details like what is in your shopping cart or how far you are through an order.
Necessary Cookies cannot be removed or turned off.
<p>We use those Cookies in a number of different ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication – To remember your login state so you don’t have to log in as you navigate through our websites.</li>
<li>Fraud Prevention and Detection – Cookies and similar technologies that we deploy through our website help us learn things about computers and web browsers used to access the Services.
This information helps us monitor for and detect potentially harmful or illegal use of our Services.</li>
<li>Security – To protect your data from unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Analytics</strong> Analytics Cookies help us understand how users interact with our Services.
We use those Cookies to analyze and improve our Services.
Cookies help us understand how people reach our website and they give us insights into improvements or enhancements we need to make to our Services.
<p>We use them to improve how our site works, understand what interests our users, and measure content effectiveness.</p>
<strong>Advertising</strong> Advertising Cookies are used to better understand your interests and show you ads from Ancestry and our third-party advertising partners that are more relevant to you.
Advertising Cookies may be used to share data with advertisers (also referred to as online behavioral advertising) so that the ads you see are more relevant to you, including from our partners, and allow you to share certain pages with social networks.
<p>These Cookies limit the number of times you see an advertisement.
We work with third parties who do this for us and we may, in limited circumstances, also place ads around our related brands’ sites.</p>

<strong>What other tracking technologies are used?</strong>
</p> &nbsp.
&nbsp.
<strong>Pixels</strong> A pixel (a.k.a, web beacons, action tags) is a tiny image that may be found within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails.
We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you opened an email or interacted with ads.
Pixels can also allow us and third parties to place Cookies on your browser.
<strong>Local Storage</strong> Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s).
Local storage may be used to improve the Ancestry experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.
<strong>SDKs</strong> A software development kit, or SDK, is a downloadable software package used in mobile applications.
A typical SDK may contain APIs which are pre-defined pieces of code that help you perform common programming tasks on the platform or other tools that help us do things like debug, build, run, and test our mobile apps.
