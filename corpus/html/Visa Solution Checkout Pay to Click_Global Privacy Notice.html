<dt> How We Use Personal Information </dt>
<dd>

<li>Provide you with the products, services, programs, offers, or information you request from Visa, and for related purposes such as determining eligibility and customer service.</li>

For example, if you enroll in a card issuer or merchant loyalty program, we will process Card Transaction Data to calculate your rewards and provide targeted offers to you from the client.</li>
<li>Operate&nbsp;Visa Checkout or click to pay with Visa (&nbsp;) including to enroll you in the solution, to enable you to stay signed in on your device (if you have chosen this), to enable you to check out using the solution, to integrate with other digital wallets (if you have chosen to do this), and to participate in programs related to your use of the solution.</li>
<li>Administer surveys, loyalty programs, sweepstakes, contests, and events.</li>
<li>Based on your choices, deliver marketing communications, personalized offers and interest-based ads to you.</li>

</ul>
<p>Please note that we may also use and disclose information that is not personally identifiable.
For example, we may publish reports that contain aggregated or statistical data, such as reports showing general payment card usage trends.
These reports do not contain any personal information.</p>

<p>
<sup>3</sup>This includes our core processing activities, such as authorization, clearing, and settlement of transactions and tokenization.</p>
<p>
</p>
</dd>
<dt> Visa Advertising Solutions (VAS) </dt>
<dd>
<p>In the United States, Visa enhances and uses Card Transaction Data for VAS, a suite of aggregated data products that enable our clients to improve their marketing efforts, such as to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns, or identify audiences for their campaigns.
The VAS products do not disclose personal information.
For example, a VAS marketing report may show our clients that consumers in a geographic area tend to spend more at auto parts stores than consumers in another geographic area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>U.S.
cardholders can opt out of Visa using their card transaction data for VAS.
This opt out will not limit our use of data in other aspects of Visa's business, including where the use is necessary to operate our business, required by law, or in designing and operating other products and services unrelated to VAS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
</dd>
<dt> Why Personal Information Is Disclosed To Others </dt>
<dd>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to:</p>

<li>Our Affiliates, which may only use your information for the purposes described in this Notice, and</li>
<li>Our service providers, who use your information to provide services to us and are required to protect it<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With your consent, we may disclose your information to merchants, rewards networks, and other partners, such as when you opt-in to a co-branded or promotional program.
In some cases, Visa operates as a service provider to companies that offer cash-back and rewards programs, and we may disclose information about you and your payment transactions based on the consent that you provided the rewards company to enable it to provide the rewards.
For example, if you sign up to receive offers from a travel partner through Visa, we may share your personal information with that partner as needed to operate the program, validate referrals, and measure success of the promotions.<br>
</p>
<p>We may share your information with other third parties as permitted by law, such as when we sell or transfer business assets, enforce our contracts, protect our property or the rights, property or safety of others, or as needed for audits, compliance, and corporate governance.</p>
<p>We will also disclose personal information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.<br>
