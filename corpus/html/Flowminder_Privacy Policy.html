</p>
<p>As part of any recruitment process, the organisation collects and processes personal data relating to job applicants.
The organisation is committed to being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to meeting its data protection obligations.</p>
What information does the organisation collect about job applicants
<p>The organisation collects a range of information about you.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>your name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number;</li>
<li>details of your qualifications, skills, experience and employment history;</li>
<li>information about your current level of remuneration, including benefit entitlements;</li>
<li>whether or not you have a disability for which the organisation needs to make reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process;</li>
<li>information about your entitlement to work in the UK.
and</li>
<li>equal opportunities monitoring information, including information about your ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health, and religion or beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The organisation collects this information in a variety of ways.
For example, data might be contained in application forms, CVs or resumes, obtained from your passport or other identity documents, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment, including online tests.</p>
<p>The organisation will also collect personal data about you from third parties, such as references supplied by former employers.
The organisation will seek information from third parties only once a job offer to you has been made and will inform you that it is doing so.</p>
<p>Data will be stored in a range of different places, including on your application record, in HR management systems and on other IT systems (including email).</p>
Why does the organisation process personal data?
<p>The organisation needs to process data to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
It also needs to process your data to enter into a contract with you.<br>In some cases, the organisation needs to process data to ensure that it is complying with its legal obligations.
For example, it is required to check a successful applicant's eligibility to work in the UK before employment starts.</p>
<p>The organisation has a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process.
Processing data from job applicants allows the organisation to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate's suitability for employment and decide to whom to offer a job.
The organisation may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.</p>
<p>Where the organisation relies on legitimate interests as a reason for processing data, it has considered whether or not those interests are overridden by the rights and freedoms of employees or workers and has concluded that they are not.</p>
<p>The organisation processes health information if it needs to make reasonable adjustments to the recruitment process for candidates who have a disability.
This is to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.</p>
<p>Where the organisation processes other special categories of data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health or religion or belief, this is for equal opportunities monitoring purposes.</p>
<p>The organisation will not use your data for any purpose other than the recruitment exercise for which you have applied.</p>
Who has access to data?
<p>Your information will be shared internally for the purposes of the recruitment exercise.
This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area with a vacancy and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for the performance of their roles.</p>
<p>The organisation will not share your data with third parties, unless your application for employment is successful and it makes you an offer of employment.
The organisation will then share your data with former employers to obtain references for you.</p>
<p>Your data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA) as we store all data in the cloud.
Data is transferred outside the EEA on the basis of US Privacy Shield and Model Contract Clauses.</p>
How does the organisation protect data?
<p>The organisation takes the security of your data seriously.
It has internal policies and controls in place to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by our employees in the proper performance of their duties.</p>
For how long does the organisation keep data?
<p>If your application for employment is unsuccessful, the organisation will hold your data on file for six months after the end of the relevant recruitment process.
If your application for employment is successful, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your personnel file and retained during your employment.
The periods for which your data will be held will be provided to you in a new privacy notice.</p>
