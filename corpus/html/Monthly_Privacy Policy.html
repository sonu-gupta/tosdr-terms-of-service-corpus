The amount and type of information depends on how you interact with our Services.
Here are some examples:</p>

<strong>Basic Account Information</strong>:&nbsp;While you can browse parts of our website without registering, we ask you to sign up for a&nbsp;com&nbsp;account to access certain parts of the Services (e.g., to participate in one of our classes).
When you sign up for a monthly.com account, we may ask you for basic personal information such as your email address, first name, and last name.
We may also allow you to submit additional voluntary account information, such as a profile picture, your bio, or country/city you’re located in.
You can also sign up to receive email newsletters and promotional offers from us or to join a waitlist for a class by submitting your email address.</li>
<li>
<strong>Public Profile Information</strong>:&nbsp;If you have an account with us and enroll in a Monthly class, certain of your profile information will be used for your public profile.
For example, your username, profile picture, and self-reported location of residence are part of that public profile, along with any other information you choose to put into your public profile, such as your bio.
