<p>Last updated: 24 October&nbsp;2019</p>SRG SSR Swiss Broadcasting Corporation<br>General<p>The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG) takes the protection of your data seriously.
We would like to make sure that you feel safe when using our <strong>
<em>SRG online platforms</em>
</strong>.
In the following, we will explain which data we collect and how we use them.</p>
<p>Any personal data you supply to SRG when using our <strong>online platforms </strong>are processed in accordance with the <strong>Swiss</strong>
<strong>Data Protection Act (DSG)</strong> and other legal provisions.
The term <em>online platforms </em>refers to a broad variety of SRG offerings on the Internet.</p>
<p>To make this Data Privacy Statement easier to read, we have replaced the DSG terms <em>controller of a data file</em> and <em>data processing by third parties </em>with <em>controller</em> and <em>processor</em>.
The Data Privacy Statement is thereby borrowing the terminology of the <em>Council of Europe</em> and the <em>European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU DS-GVO)</em>.
You will find an overview of the most important terms of the DSG and their equivalents in the EU DS-GVO in our <strong>glossary</strong>.</p>End of insertion<p>
<br>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>II.&nbsp;</em>
</strong>
<strong>
<em>Transparency: </em>
</strong>
<em>Data privacy is a top priority to us.
We therefore inform our users of the purpose of the data processing.
Where necessary, we obtain the users' consent.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>III.&nbsp;</em>
</strong>
<strong>
<em>Security: </em>
</strong>
<em>Data security is a top priority to us.

<p>
<br>

<p>SRG reserves the right to change this Data Privacy Statement from time to time.
We therefore recommend that you read this Data Privacy Statement regularly.
You will see the date of the last update at the top of this Data Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>
<strong>What are personal data?</strong>
</p>
<p>Personal data are the details of an identified or identifiable natural person, e.g.
name, address, telephone number, date of birth or e-mail address.</p>
<p>
<em>As a rule, you can use our online platforms without providing any personal data.
</em>To use certain online platforms you may be required to enter personal data, e.g.
in order to subscribe to a newsletter, post a comment or enter a competition.</p>
<p>Personal data are therefore not generally processed, but only under <em>certain circumstances</em> and for <em>specific purposes</em>.</p>
<p>
<strong>When are personal data processed for the SRG online platforms?</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to provide the <strong>SRG</strong>
<strong>online platforms</strong>, SRG or third parties process personal data in the context of:</p>
<p>
<strong>A.&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>Websites: </strong>Personal data are processed via the <strong>logfiles, cookies, analysis tools, contact forms </strong>and <strong>plug-ins</strong> of social media and other providers.</p>
<p>
<strong>B.&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>User-generated content</strong>: Personal data are captured via forums, chats and blogs and processed in the form of <strong>user-generated content</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>C.&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>Newsletters:</strong> Personal data are processed on the basis of your consent when you subscribe to the <strong>newsletter</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>D.&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>Contact forms:</strong> Personal data are processed via <strong>contact forms </strong>when you submit suggestions and questions about our service.</p>
<p>
<strong>E.&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>Competitions: </strong>Personal data are processed via <strong>contact forms </strong>when you take part in a competitions.</p>
<p>
<strong>For what purposes are personal data processed?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>To make the online platforms available to users</li>
<li>To optimize the online platforms (e.g.market research and audience measurement)</li>
<li>To personalize the online platforms for their users</li>
<li>To send out e-mail newsletters</li>
<li>To run competitions</li>
<li>To protect the data of the online platform users</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Based on which legal foundations does SRG process personal data?</strong>
</p>
<p>If we obtain your <strong>consent</strong> to process your personal data, this serves as the legal basis.
This is the case with newsletters, comment posts or competitions, for example.</p>
<p>We also process your personal data on the basis of <strong>our legitimate interest</strong>.
This includes processing data for the purpose of providing and optimizing our online platforms.</p>
<p>When personal data are processed under a <strong>legal obligation</strong>, this obligation serves as the legal basis.
This may be the case, for example, when personal data are passed on to a third party, and for reasons of obligatory storage duration or retention periods.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>Disclosure of personal data to third parties<p>
<strong>Do we pass personal data on to third parties?</strong>
</p>
<p>We only disclose your personal data to third parties if you have given your consent or if there is a legitimate interest on our part.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we may transmit data to third parties if we are obliged to do so on the basis of legal provisions or an enforceable administrative or judicial order.</p>
<p>
<strong>Are any third parties involved in the processing of data?</strong>
</p>
<p>We use service providers for the data processing.
Service providers are generally involved as contractors who are permitted to process users' personal data only in accordance with our instructions.
For example, your e-mail address may be passed on to a service provider so that it can send you a newsletter that you subscribed to.</p>
<p>
<strong>Do we pass on personal data to recipients in a third-party country (outside Switzerland/EU/EEA)?</strong>
</p>
<p>We do pass on personal data to third parties or contractors who are not based in Switzerland nor a EU/EEA country.
In this case, before passing on the data, we check that the recipient either has an appropriate level of data privacy (e.g.
based on a suitability test for the respective country, a self-certification process by the recipient for the Swiss-US Privacy ShieldExternal link (framework for transmitting personal data from Switzerland to the USA), or by using &nbsp;the European Union's standard contract clauses or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (EDÖB) standard contract) or that the user has given their consent.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>Storage duration and retention periods<p>
<strong>For how long does SRG store the personal data?</strong>
</p>
<p>We store your data for as long as necessary to make our online platforms and the associated services available or for as long as we have a legitimate interest in storing them.
In all cases, we delete your personal data except those that we need to continue to store in order to fulfil our legal obligations (e.g.
retention periods).</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>Users' rights<p>
<strong>What rights do you have?</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Right to information: </strong>Users have the right to demand from the controller confirmation of the personal data that are processed and whether they are transmitted to a third-party country.</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to correction: </strong>Users have the right to demand that the controller correct any incorrect or incomplete personal data that pertain to them.</li>
<li>

<li>
<strong>Right to limited processing: </strong>Users have the right to demand that the controller limits the processing of their data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to revoke consent: </strong>Users have the right to revoke their consent to the processing of their respective personal data for one or more specific purposes at any time, if the processing is based on their express consent.
When you revoke your consent, the legality of the processing that was done until then is not affected as this was based on the consent you had given before revoking it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to object: </strong>Users have the right to object to the processing of their respective personal data at any time, if the processing is done on the basis of the legitimate interest of the controller or a third party for the purpose of direct marketing, for example.</li>
