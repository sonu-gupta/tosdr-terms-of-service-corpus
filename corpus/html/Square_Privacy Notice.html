<p>Privacy laws that apply in certain places, like California, treat “businesses” and “service providers” differently.
Under those laws, a business is the company that decides why and how to process personal information.
A service provider processes personal information on behalf of a business in order to provide services.
When Square processes Your Customers’ Data, we generally act as your service provider.
In select cases, however, we may act as a business when we process Your Customers’ Data.
For example, we act as a business when we use Your Customers’ Data to send Your Customers digital receipts directly from Square, or when we allow you to use Customer Directory or Square Marketing to contact your buyer using a masked email address (for example, j<strong>**</strong>***@gmail.com) that gets routed to them via Square.
Your Customers can visit the Privacy Notice for Square Buyer Features for more information on how Square processes their data when it is acting as a business, and the Privacy Notice for non-account holders for more information on how Square processes their data as your service provider.</p> SOURCES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU <p>We collect your information from you and the other sources listed below.</p>

<p>When you interact with our online services, or open emails we send you, we obtain certain information using automated technologies, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other technologies.
A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.
A “web beacon,” also known as an internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, is a tiny graphic image that may be used in our websites or emails.</p>

For example, we may use other companies’ web analytics services (described in the “Third-Party Analytics Services” section), which use automated technologies to help us evaluate how customers use our websites.</p>
<p>Your browser can alert you when cookies are placed on your device, and how you can stop or disable them via your browser settings.

The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs to help us analyze how you use our online services.

</ul> ONLINE TRACKING AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING <p>We and the service providers we use to advertise to you may collect information about your activities on Square.
We use this information to advertise to you and to tailor our products and services to your interests.
You may see certain ads on other websites because we use third-party services to advertise our services to you.
We use these services to target our ads to you and others based on your demographics, interests, and context.
These third party ad services track your online activities over time and across multiple websites by collecting your information through automated technologies, including third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons.
The ad services use this information to show you Square ads that may be tailored to your individual interests.
The information our ad services may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Square ads, such as the pages or ads you view and the actions you take on those websites.
This data collection takes place both on our online services, and on third-party websites that serve our ads to you.
This process also helps us figure out if our ads to you are effective.</p>

<p>Certain web browsers allow you to instruct your browser to respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals to website you visit, informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be tracked.
At this time, our websites are not designed to respond to DNT signals or similar mechanisms from browsers.</p> HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION <p>We keep your information as long as you keep using our products and services.
After that, we keep it for as long as we need it to do things like fight fraud, collect fees you owe, resolve disputes with (or involving) you, follow the law, enforce our agreements and defend our rights in court.</p>
<p>We generally keep your information as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law.
However, even after you deactivate your account, we can retain copies of information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of time that is consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our General Terms or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.</p> YOUR CHOICES <p>You can see, change or fix information you gave us, ask us to deactivate your account, control your location information, or tell us to stop marketing to you by opting out.</p>

This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising.

This program offers a mobile application called the “AppChoices,” which provides a centralized location where you can make choices about the use of your information for online behavioral advertising within the mobile environment.
The AppChoices application can be downloaded from your mobile device at www.aboutads.info/appchoices or from your device’s app store.
If you opt out of online behavioral advertising using this method, this opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.</p>

<strong>Even though you use our services while acting as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietor of a business, nonprofit, or government agency, if you live in</strong> California, California law gives you the right to ask if we disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes (we do not disclose your personal information for others’ direct marketing purposes).
It also gives you the right to ask if we sell your personal information to third parties (we do not sell your personal information and have not done so in the past), and if we did (which we don’t), you’d have the right to opt out of such sales.</p> Children’s Personal Information <p>If you are a kid under 13, please don’t use our services.
