<p>4.- <strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>You can manage your data preferences using two built-in tools.
The Control Center manages your preferences when you’re logged into your Ring account, while the Cookie Preferences Manager controls your preferences when you’re browsing Ring.com websites when you are not logged in (e.g., e-commerce -- ring.com/products).
We will apply your cookie preferences to our Sites and the browser on which you made your choice.<br>
<br>
Different cookies may be used between your logged in and/or logged out experiences.
If you disable a particular cookie in the Cookie Preferences Manager, but have enabled it in the Control Center, we will disable it for both logged-in and logged-out experiences.
But if you enable a particular cookie in the Cookie Preferences Manager and disable it in the Control Center, we will disable it throughout your logged-in experience but enable it in the logged-out experience because we are not able to verify the identity of your Ring account when you are logged out.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you can disable cookies from your web browser by selecting the appropriate settings.
Most web browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, how to disable or remove existing cookies and when cookies will expire.
You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser’s menu or by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org.
For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.
Please note, however, that without certain cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Sites or our products or services.
For example, if you disable all essential cookies in your browser, you may not be able to add items to your shopping basket, proceed to checkout or use any our Sites that require login.
You may also need to manually adjust some of your preferences every time you visit one of our Sites.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>5.- <strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>For our European ring.com domains, there is a 13-month retention period for Analytics Cookies and Advertising Cookies on your browser, which starts once you opt-in to the cookies via the Cookie Preferences Manager.
If you opt out of such cookies via the Cookie Preferences Manager, then we will remove them from your browser and disable them until you change your preferences.<br>
