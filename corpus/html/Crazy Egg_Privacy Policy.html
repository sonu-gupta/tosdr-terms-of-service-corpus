<p>This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Crazy Egg, Inc.
(“Crazy Egg”, “we”, “us”, “our”) on our websites located at the domains crazyegg.com, crazyeggvcr.com, and crazyeggproxy.com, as well as such other websites or mobile applications that we own or operate (individually and collectively, “Our Website” or the “Crazy Egg Website”).</p>
<ol>
<li> Scope of this Privacy Policy <p>As further discussed, below, data protection laws, regulations, and directives in certain jurisdictions distinguish between the rights and responsibilities of “Controller(s)” of personal information or data (“Information”), from those who are “Processor(s)” of such Information or data on the applicable controllers’ behalf.
Crazy Egg is generally the controller of Information that it collects from and about the persons and entities who are visiting Our Website (“Crazy Egg Visitors”), and this Privacy Policy applies to Crazy Egg Visitors.</p>
<p>We also provide certain services to commercial persons and entities (each, a “Client” and collectively, “Clients”), who, in turn, own and operate their own websites or mobile applications (“Client Site(s)”), and who wish to utilize our code, software and services and reports (the “Service(s)”) to analyze how third party visitors to their Client Sites (“Client Site Visitor(s)”) use, interact with, and engage their Client Sites.
The applicable Clients are the Controllers of Information collected from their Client Site Visitors, whether or not such information is accessed, analyzed, or otherwise utilized by or on behalf of the Client via the Service (“Client Visitor Information”).
Crazy Egg is not the Controller of such Client Visitor Information.
This Privacy Policy applies to the use of Services by our Clients.
However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the Client Sites themselves, nor to any Client Visitor Information.
For any questions regarding the privacy, security, or other practices or policies on the Client Sites, please contact the applicable Client.</p>

For example, if a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from a search engine, Crazy Egg may receive information contained in the referring URL for the applicable search query, such as the terms the Crazy Egg Visitor was searching for before visiting the Crazy Egg Website.</p> Registration Information from Crazy Egg Clients <p>When Crazy Egg Visitors register as Clients to use the Crazy Egg Service, register to use a trial version of the Crazy Egg Service, or request additional information about Crazy Egg, Crazy Egg may require Information, such as name, employer or company name, e-mail, mailing address, phone number, financial information (e.g., credit card number, billing address), and/or proposed Client Site to be tracked, to process the registration or request ("Client Registration Information").</p> Session Recording Information <p>We may use session recording software on the Crazy Egg Website.
This software enables us to record Crazy Egg Visitors’ use, interaction, and engagement with the Crazy Egg Website.
This software may capture user input, such as mouse and keyboard inputs and mobile gestures, and user views, such as browser or screen output.
