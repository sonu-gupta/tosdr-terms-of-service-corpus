<p>
<b>VII.
DISPUTES, ARBITRATION, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b>
</p>
<p>Any dispute arising out of or relating to the Services ("Dispute") will be resolved according to the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Notice of Dispute</b>.
In the event of a Dispute, you or the Beacon must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution.
You must send any Notice of Dispute by U.S.
Mail to the <i>Washington Free Beacon</i> at 1600 K Street NW, STE 200, Washington, DC 20006.
The Beacon will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S.
Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address.
You and the Beacon will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.
After sixty (60) days, you or the Beacon may commence arbitration, as described in this section.</li>
<li>
<b>Small claims court</b>.
You may also choose to litigate any Dispute in small claims court in the District of Columbia or in your own county of residence, if the Dispute meets all the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated with the Beacon informally first.</li>
<li>
<b>Binding Arbitration</b>.
If you and the Beacon do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section.
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.
Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</li>
<li>
<b>Class Action Waiver</b>
<b>.</b> Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
Neither you nor the Beacon will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</li>
<li>
<b>Arbitration Procedures</b>.
Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, Inc, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules").
You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in the District of Columbia.
The Beacon agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence.
In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</li>
<li>
<b>Arbitration Fees</b>.
For disputes involving $75,000 or less, the Beacon will reimburse your filing fees and pay the JAMS and the arbitrators fees and expenses.
For disputes involving more than $75,000, the JAMS Rules will govern payment of all filing fees and expenses.</li>
<li>
<b>Claims or disputes must be filed within one year</b>.
To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in small claims court, or in an arbitration proceeding.
The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.
If a claim or dispute isn’t filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</li>
<li>
<b>Severability</b>.
If any provision of this section ("Disputes, Arbitration, and Class Waiver") is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed, with the remainder of the section remaining in full force and effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>VII.
Choice of Law and Forum</b>
</p>
<p>The Services are intended for use by residents of the United States.
We do not intentionally provide access to the Services to individuals located outside the United States.
These Terms will be governed by the laws of the District of Columbia without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
With respect to any Disputes not subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth above, you and the Beacon agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>
<b>VIII.
Miscellaneous</b>
</p>
<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us.
In the event any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.
You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Services.</p>
<p>Our failure to enforce any provisions of these Terms or respond to a violation by any party does not waive our right to subsequently enforce any terms or conditions of the Terms or respond to any violations.
Nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use.</p>
