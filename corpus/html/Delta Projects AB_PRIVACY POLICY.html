<b>Sensitive personal data</b>
<p>Delta Projects does not knowingly create data segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we don’t create any data segments to determine credit worthiness, for insurance underwriting or similar purposes, nor do we create segments of EU consumers based on personal data considered to be sensitive in the EU, e.g.

We take steps designed to ensure that this is done in compliance with applicable laws and self-regulatory guidelines, including through our contracts and policies with our clients and partners.</p>
<b>How the data is being collected</b>

<p>None of these technologies enable us to personally identify an individual as yourself.
Instead, they enable the Services to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a browser or device is the same as one with which the Services has previously interacted.
