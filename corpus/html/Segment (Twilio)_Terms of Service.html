The supported Sources and Destinations are identified in the Documentation.
For Sources owned or controlled by Customers (“<b>Customer Properties</b>”), Customer enables the collection of Customer Data by implementing Segment’s JavaScript, SDK or other code (“<b>Segment Code</b>”) on such Customer Properties.

<p>Each party (as “<b>Receiving Party</b>”) agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (“<b>Disclosing Party </b> constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party, ("<b>Confidential Information</b>”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.
&nbsp;Any Segment technology, performance information relating to the Services, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Segment without any marking or further designation.
&nbsp;Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party shall (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.
&nbsp;The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Segment, the subcontractors referenced in Section 13.10), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 10 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 10.
&nbsp;The Receiving Party’s confidentiality obligations shall not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.
(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.
(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.
or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.
&nbsp;The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.
&nbsp;The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;<b>Role and Scope of the Processing</b>
</p>
<p>a.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;Segment will Process Customer Data only in accordance with Customer’s instructions.
By entering into the Agreement, Customer instructs Segment to Process Customer Data to provide the Services and pursuant to any other written instructions given by Customer and acknowledged in writing by Segment as constituting instructions for purposes of this Addendum.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that such instruction authorizes Segment to Process Customer Data (a) to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Agreement.
and (b) to perform its legal obligations and to establish, exercise or defend legal claims in respect of the Agreement.</p>
<p>b.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;For clarity, nothing in this Addendum limits Segment from transmitting Customer Data to and among Sources and Destinations as directed by Customer through the Services.
The parties agree that neither Sources nor Destinations are Subprocessors of Segment and that, between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for the Processing of Customer Personal Data by, and other acts and omissions of, Sources and Destinations or parties associated therewith.</p>
<p>6.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;<b>Subprocessing</b>
</p>
<p>a.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;Customer specifically authorizes Segment to use its Affiliates as Subprocessors, and generally authorizes Segment to engage Third Party Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data.
Segment:</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;shall enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor, imposing data protection obligations substantially similar to those set out in this Addendum.
and</p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;remains liable for compliance with the obligations of this Addendum and for any acts or omissions of the Subprocessor that cause Segment to breach any of its obligations under this Addendum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;A list of Segment’s Subprocessors, including their functions and locations, is available at https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/ or such other website as Segment may designate (“<b>Subprocessor Page</b>”), and may be updated by Segment from time to time in accordance with this Addendum.</p>
<p>c.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;When any new Third Party Subprocessor is engaged, Segment will notify Customer of the engagement, which notice may be given by updating the Subprocessor Page and via a message through Customer’s Segment Workspace.
Segment will give such notice at least ten (10) calendar days before the new Subprocessor Processes any Customer Personal Data, except that if Segment reasonably believes engaging a new Subprocessor on an expedited basis is necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Customer Personal Data or avoid material disruption to the Services, Segment will give such notice as soon as reasonably practicable.
If, within five (5) calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies Segment in writing that Customer objects to Segment’s appointment of a new Third Party Subprocessor based on reasonable data protection concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith and whether they can be resolved.
If the parties are not able to mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for convenience.</p>
<p>7.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
<b>Security</b>
</p>
<p>a.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;Segment shall implement and maintain technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Customer Personal Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data, in accordance with Segment’s security standards referenced in the Agreement (“<b>Security Measures</b>”).</p>
<p>b.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Segment relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meet Customer’s requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws.
Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Segment’s obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p>
<p>c.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;Upon becoming aware of a confirmed Security Incident, Segment shall notify Customer without undue delay unless prohibited by applicable law.
A delay in giving such notice requested by law enforcement and/or in light of Segment’s legitimate needs to investigate or remediate the matter before providing notice shall not constitute an undue delay.
Such notices will describe, to the extent possible, details of the Security Incident, including steps taken to mitigate the potential risks and steps Segment recommends Customer take to address the Security Incident.
Without prejudice to Segment’s obligations under this Section 7.c., Customer is solely responsible for complying with Security Incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Security Incidents.
Segment’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 7.c.
will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Segment of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.</p>
<p>d.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;Customer agrees that, without limitation of Segment’s obligations under this Section 7, Customer is solely responsible for its use of the Services, including (a) making appropriate use of the Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of the Customer Data.
(b) securing the account authentication credentials, systems and devices Customer uses to access the Services.
(c) securing Customer’s systems and devices that it uses with the Services.
and (d) maintaining its own backups of Customer Data.</p>
<p>8.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;<b>Data Subject Requests</b>
</p>
<p>Segment shall upon Customer’s request (and at Customer’s expense) provide Customer with such assistance as it may reasonably require to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in cases where Customer cannot reasonably fulfill such requests independently by using the self-service functionality of the Services.
If Segment receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to their Customer Personal Data, Segment will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request.</p>
<p>9.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;<b>Return or Deletion of Data</b>
</p>
<p>a.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;Segment shall, within sixty (60) days after request by Customer following the termination or expiration of the Agreement, delete all of the Customer Personal Data from Segment’s systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.
&nbsp.
