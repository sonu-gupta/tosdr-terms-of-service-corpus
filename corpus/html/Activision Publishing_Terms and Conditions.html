BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</p>
<p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p>
<p>These BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Product in the United States.
&nbsp;In the United States, this Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal arbitration law.&nbsp.
These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Product from outside the United States.
See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.</p>
<p>To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and Activision agree to submit all Disputes between us to individual, binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions in this Section 4.&nbsp.
A “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and Activision that in any way relates to or arises from any aspect of our relationship, including, without limitation, your use or attempted use of the Product, all marketing related to the Product, all Services, Service Provided Content, and Virtual Currency, any licensed content, and all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement (including Activision’s Privacy Policy and all other terms incorporated into this Agreement) or any other agreement between you and Activision, including any disputes over the validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.&nbsp.
A Dispute shall be subject to these BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions regardless of whether it is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.&nbsp.
This includes claims or requests for relief that accrued before you entered into this Agreement.&nbsp.
You understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award is limited.</p>
<p>
<b>Initial Dispute Resolution</b>:&nbsp.
Activision's Customer Support department is available at https://support.activision.com/ to address any concerns you may have regarding the Product.
Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction.
In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute between us, you and Activision agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding (the “Initial Dispute Resolution Period”).&nbsp.
That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the Dispute.&nbsp.
If Activision has a Dispute with you, it will send notice of that Dispute to your billing address and email address you have provided to us.&nbsp.
If you have a Dispute with Activision, you must notify us in writing at the following email address: legalaffairs@activision.com, using the subject line “Initial Dispute Resolution Notice.”&nbsp.
Your notice of Dispute must be individual to you and must include your name, the screen name and/or email address associated with your player account, and your residential address.&nbsp.
The notice of Dispute also must describe the Dispute, explain the facts of the Dispute as you understand them, and tell Activision what you want us to do to resolve the problem.&nbsp.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of Dispute containing all of the information required above, followed by at least 30 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.&nbsp.
A notice of Dispute will not be valid, will not start the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, and will not allow you or Activision later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph.&nbsp.
If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant notice of Dispute, you and Activision agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it complies with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period.&nbsp.
You and Activision authorize the arbitration provider or the arbitrator to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period requirement, relying solely on this Agreement and the notice of Dispute (if any) that you or Activision provided before commencing arbitration.</p>
<p>
<b>Binding Arbitration</b>: If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations during the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve the Dispute, unless an exception applies as stated below.&nbsp.
Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration (as defined below), the arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) effective as of the date of the Notice of Dispute, which are available at the JAMS website, http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration, as modified by this Agreement.&nbsp.
If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, then except as otherwise stated below, you may file your Dispute with any national arbitration company that handles consumer arbitrations following procedures that are substantially similar to the JAMS Rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitration hearings may be conducted by videoconference unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary.&nbsp.
In such instances, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles County, California, and you and Activision agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law.
The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and Activision, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration.
The arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of validity, enforceability or arbitrability, including, but not limited to, where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are exempted from the arbitration requirement or that any portion of this agreement is not enforceable.</p>
<p>If a lawsuit filed in court includes claims or requests for relief that are arbitrable and claims or requests for relief that are not, you and Activision agree that any non-arbitrable claims or requests for relief shall be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable claims or requests for relief.</p>
<p>
<b>Class Action Waiver</b>: &nbsp;TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND ACTIVISION AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL.&nbsp.
To the extent applicable law does not permit waiver of private attorney general claims, but permits them to be arbitrated, then such claims shall be resolved in arbitration.&nbsp.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.</p>
<p>If any provision in Section 4 of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect.&nbsp;<b>The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or collective actions as provided for above.
This means that if the prohibition against class or collective actions is found to be unenforceable for any reason, the entire Section 4 of this Agreement (but only Section 4) shall be null and void.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims:</b>&nbsp;Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Product under this Agreement.
Such claims are subject to the &nbsp;jurisdiction and applicable law provisions in Section 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
If an arbitration is filed, before the arbitrator is formally appointed either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider may close the case.</p>
<p>
<b>Exception – Mass Arbitration Before FedArb:&nbsp;</b>Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to have arbitrations administered by JAMS, if 20 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall not be governed by JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS.
Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by FedArb, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the FedArb Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the “FedArb Rules”), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement.
The FedArb Rules are available at https://www.fedarb.com/ or by calling 1-650-328-9500.
You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using FedArb’s Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL, available at https://www.fedarb.com/.
Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with FedArb, you and we agree to contact FedArb jointly to advise that the parties intend to use FedArb’s Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL.
The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on FedArb’s claim form(s) and as directed by FedArb.
You and Activision agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before FedArb rather than JAMS, you or Activision may seek an order from JAMS compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before FedArb.
Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed.<b>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>30 Day Right to Opt Out</b>: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration agreement and class action waiver provisions in this Section 4 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email address: legalaffairs@activision.com, using the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out.” The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Product (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Product and agree to these terms).
otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.

Entire Agreement</p>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and Activision, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the matters contained herein.</p>
<p>Appendix 1</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS – APPLICABLE TO RESIDENTS OF GERMANY</p>
<p>The following Section below supersedes and replaces the corresponding Section 14 (‘Termination’) with respect to sub-section B(i):</p>
<p>ACTIVISION MAY TERMINATE THE LICENSE GRANTED TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR SUSPEND, MODIFY, OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU SERIOUSLY VIOLATE THIS AGREEMENT.
WE WILL NOTIFY YOU IN ADVANCE IF WE DECIDE TO TERMINATE OR SUSPEND THE LICENSE, UNLESS WE ARE TERMINATING OR SUSPENDING IT TO COMPLY WITH A LEGAL OBLIGATION WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE A PRIOR NOTICE OBLIGATION.
WE WILL RESTORE THIS LICENSE IF YOU HAVE GOOD CAUSE TO BELIEVE OUR ACTIONS WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY JUSTIFIED.
SERIOUS VIOLATIONS ARE VIOLATIONS OF IMPORTANT PROVISIONS WHICH INCLUDE SECTION 3(C)(i)-(iv) AND 8(E) OF THIS AGREEMENT, REPEATED VIOLATIONS OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING FURTHER NON-COMPLIANCE WHERE YOU HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED A PRIOR WARNING).</p>
<p>IF YOU THINK THAT SUCH DECISION WAS TAKEN WRONGLY, YOU CAN CONTACT ACTIVISION AT support.activision.com.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of the sub-section ‘For the residents of the European Economic Area’ of Section 19 shall be replaced with the following paragraph:</p>
<p>If these changes affect you negatively in a more than minor way, we will give you at least six weeks’ advance notice of the change and you will have 30 days from our notice of the change or from when the change comes into effect (whichever is later) to reject the changes and terminate the Agreement.
You may also be able to receive a proportionate refund for any Product or Service Provided Content paid for but not received.
Please visit support.activision.com for more information.
If you do not reject these changes or terminate the Agreement within the stated time limit, we will take that as your acceptance of the changes.</p>
<p>The sub-section ‘For residents of the European Union and the United Kingdom’ within Section 22 shall be replaced with the following paragraphs:</p>
<p>From time to time, Activision may need to amend this Agreement if there is a good reason for the change and the changes reasonably take into account the interests of both parties, for example to reflect or include new products or services, and to enhance security for users or because of changes in the law, but we will not modify the terms to change our main obligations to you.
If Activision makes a change to this Agreement, we will inform you of the particular changes in advance of the changes coming into force, and you will have at least six weeks (starting from our notice to you) to indicate whether you accept the amended Agreement.
If you don’t tell us that you object to the changes within the time period set out above, you shall be deemed to have accepted these changes (i) unless you have notified us of your objection to such changes within the stated six weeks, or (ii) if you use the Product after the changes have entered into force.
In the&nbsp;notification, we will inform you of your right to object, the applicable notice period and the legal consequences of a failure to object.</p>
<p>The latest version of this Agreement will always be available on our website, so we recommend that you check for updates to this Agreement each time you use the Product.
Changes to the Agreement shall not affect your accrued rights, shall not substantially disrupt the contractual balance between you and us under this Agreement and shall not have retroactive effect.</p>

Information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal
<p>
<b>Right of Withdrawal</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>You have the right to withdraw from this Agreement within 14 calendar days without giving any reason.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The withdrawal period will expire after 14 calendar days from the day of the conclusion of the Agreement.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us (Legal Team, Activision Blizzard UK Ltd of The Ampersand Building, 178 Wardour Street, London, W1F 8FY, United Kingdom) contact details available at&nbsp;</b>
<b>www.support.activision.com</b>
<b>&nbsp;of your decision to withdraw from the Agreement by an unequivocal statement (e.g.
a letter sent by post, or e-mail).
You may use the model withdrawal form attached hereafter, but it is not obligatory.
To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Effects of withdrawal</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>If you withdraw from the Agreement, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you under this Agreement, including the costs of delivery if applicable (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 calendar days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this Agreement.
We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise.
in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>If you requested to begin the performance of services under an Agreement during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated to us your withdrawal from that Agreement, in comparison with the full coverage of these services under the Agreement.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>You lose your right of withdrawal, insofar as the Agreement is a service contract, after the service has been fully performed and if the performance has begun with your prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that you will lose your right of withdrawal once the service has been fully performed by us.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>You lose your right of withdrawal insofar as the Agreement comprises the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal.</b>
</p>
<p>Based on the above, you understand that by purchasing Service Provided Content, you consent that we make available these Service Provided Content to you directly after we have accepted your order.
You will lose your right of withdrawal once the Service Provided Content has been made fully available to you by us.
However, your right of withdrawal is not lost if you purchase Virtual Goods that are granted to you for a certain period of time (e.g.
time-limited premium memberships).</p>

<b>C.
Statutory guarantees under French law for residents in France regarding the Product</b>
French law grants you as consumers the following statutory rights and guarantees in relation to the Product.
Activision will therefore offer you the protection granted by law under the legal warranty of conformity provided by articles L.
224-25-12 to L.
224-25-26 of the French Consumer Code.
Activision is liable for supplying digital contents and services that comply with the Agreement and with the objective and subjective criteria set out by the law.
Regarding one-off supply, Activision is accountable for any non-conformity that exists at the time of supply and which becomes apparent within two years of supply.
Regarding digital content or service supplied on a continuous basis, Activision is accountable for any non-conformity which becomes apparent during the period in which it is supplied under the Agreement.
We are also accountable, within the same time limits, for any non-conformity resulting from the incorrect integration of the digital content or service into the consumer's digital environment where this has been done by us or under our responsibility, or where the incorrect integration by the consumer is the result of deficiencies in the instructions provided by us.
For the 12 month period following the supply of the Product, the consumer will not be required to prove the existence of the defect.
In the event of lack of conformity, the consumer shall be entitled to have the digital content or service brought into conformity or, failing that, to have the price reduced or to cancel the contract under the conditions set out in the French Consumer Code.
