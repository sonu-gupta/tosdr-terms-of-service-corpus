<strong>Personal Information Collected through the Security Camera or other Camera-Enabled Products</strong>

<p> When you enable the recording features of your security camera or other camera-enabled products (for example, SimpliSafe’s video doorbell product), we will record, store, and process video and/or audio recordings from the device, depending on how you configure the camera and its settings.
This may include capturing and making available to you portions of the recording data as part of a notification or analysis of the data to identify motion or other events.
We process and store information from your camera-enabled product so that we can send you alerts when there is an event.
If you have the recording features enabled, during the subscription period applicable to your camera-enabled product we will capture, process, and store video and audio recordings from your camera for at least 30 days from the date such data is first recorded and stored on our systems ("SimpliSafe's date of first capture").
During your subscription period, you will be able to access those recordings for up to 30 days from SimpliSafe's date of first capture of such data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE: Privacy laws in your state may impose certain obligations on you and your use of security camera or other camera-enabled products.
You (not SimpliSafe) are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use such camera-enabled products.
For example, you may be required to display a notice (even inside your home) that alerts visitors to your home that you are using a security camera or other camera-enabled products that are recording audio and video.
Please also consider that recording and sharing of video that involves other people may affect their privacy rights.</strong>
