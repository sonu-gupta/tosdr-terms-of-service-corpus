<strong>Onward Transfer to Third Parties</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services.
We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services.
The types of companies that may receive personal information and their functions are: hosting services, technical assistance and security, database management/back-up services, payment processors, analytics and digital marketing, CRMs, collaboration software, and customer service.
All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and implemented by Weights and Biases.
We may also disclose personal information to our parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures, or other companies under common control in order to support marketing, sale and delivery of any services.<br>

<p>Weights and Biases’s accountability for personal information that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles.

<p>In the event of a merger, dissolution, reorganization or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity.
