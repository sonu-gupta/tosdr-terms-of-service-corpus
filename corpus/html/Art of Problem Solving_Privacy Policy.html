This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time as necessary.
</p> COPPA Policy <p> The federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires that we inform you of our practices with regards to our collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children under the age of 13, and to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to collecting, using, or disclosing any such information.
If we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will either seek the parent's consent for that collection or delete the information.
We won't require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.
</p> 1.
Information we collect and share <p> When we use the term "children" or "child", it refers to individuals under the age of 13.
We may collect and share the following personal information with verifiable parental consent (where necessary under COPPA) from children:
</p>
<p> (a) Children may provide us their email address during registration or as part of receiving our services.
We may use this email address to communicate directly with the child.
If the child joins one of our email lists, their email address will be shared with the third party we use to manage our email lists.
We will not otherwise share an email address with a third party except when required by law.
</p>
<p> (b) A username used to uniquely identify each child is created during registration.
This username may be disclosed on our website, for example in our message boards, online classroom, or any other part of the site on which the child may participate.
Other members of the website may use the child's username to directly contact the child (for example, by private message or in online classroom discussions).
</p>
<p> (c) We may ask the child to provide his or her real name.
The child's name will only be used for internal purposes, or will be disclosed only to third parties to whom the child has given specific authorization, for example a teacher at the child's school who has requested access from the child to view the child's online school reports or a coach overseeing the child’s participation in a contest you have authorized to access your contest results.
Such third parties must request permission from us before they request this information from the child, and we make a reasonable effort to determine if the third party has your consent and their request is legitimate before granting such permission.
The child's real name will never be made publicly available on our website by us.
</p>
<p> (d) Other non-identifying data may be collected in the course of a child's participation on the website.
for example, online homework submissions, live classroom discussions, etc.
These data may be combined or associated with the child's username, and may be publicly available on the site, at the child's or parent's discretion.
</p>
<p> (e) Children using our site may have the opportunity to post personal information about themselves (for example, in a message board post or on a blog or in our online classroom).
Such information may be publicly displayed on the website alongside the child's username.
We strongly discourage users from sharing personal information, but we cannot prevent it in every instance.
This policy addresses how parents can delete information posted by their children in item #2 below.
</p>
<p> (f) When children use our websites, certain information may automatically be collected by third parties: IP address or mobile identifier, the type of computer operating system, the web browser, the frequency with which the user visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider.

</p>
<ul>
<li> An email address is collected from a child at the time of registration, solely to contact the child's parent in order to obtain the necessary parental consent.
</li>
<li> To protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology.

however, this username cannot be used to contact the child, nor be used for the purposes listed in sections (c) and (d) of above, unless and until we receive verifiable parental consent.
</li>
</ul> 2.
Parental rights and responsibilities
