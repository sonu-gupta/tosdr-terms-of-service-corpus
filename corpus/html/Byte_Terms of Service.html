</ol>
</li>
<li>
<b>Governing Law and Forum Choice.</b> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 19 "Dispute Resolution," the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Byte are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Southern District of New York, and you and Byte each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</li>
<li>
<b>Dispute Resolution.
</b>
<ol>
<li>
<u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</u> We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, <b>"Disputes"</b>) will be resolved <b>solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.</b> You and Byte agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Byte are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
</li>
<li>
<u>Exceptions and Opt-out.</u> As limited exceptions to Section 19(a) above: (i)&nbsp;you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
In addition, you will retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email at hello@byte.co or by regular mail at <b>Byte Legal Department, PO Box 611, New York, NY 10272</b> within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms.</li>
<li>
<u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.</u> The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.
The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.
<p>If your claim is for U.S.
$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds U.S.
$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location.
The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<u>Arbitration Costs.</u> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
We'll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration we'll pay all of our attorneys' fees and costs and won't seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</li>
<li>
<u>Class Action Waiver.</u> YOU AND BYTE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, if the parties' dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</li>
<li>
<u>Effect of Changes on Arbitration.</u> Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 "Changes to these Terms or the Services" above, if Byte changes any of the terms of this Section 19 "Dispute Resolution" after the date you most recently accepted these Terms, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to hello@byte.co) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of Byte's email to you notifying you of such change.
By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Byte in accordance with the terms of this Section 19 "Dispute Resolution" as of the date you most recently accepted these Terms.</li>
<li>
<u>Severability.</u> With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 19(e) of these Terms ("Class Action Waiver"), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</li>
</ol>
