<p>INTERNATIONAL USERS – CONSENT TO PROCESSING AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Service is operated and based in the United States, with our servers and offices headquartered in the United States.
Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Service may be processed and transferred to, and be subject to the laws of, the United States.
The privacy and data protection laws in the United States may not be equivalent to privacy and data protection laws in your country of residence.
By using the Service, or by providing us with any information about your preferences or about you, including information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number or home address you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of any and all such information to and within the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
For more information on safeguards relating to international transfers, see &nbsp;HOW WE TRANSFER INFORMATION WE COLLECT INTERNATIONALLY</p>
<p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p>Information You Provide to Us</p>
<p>In connection with the Service, the Company may collect information that can identify you, including, but not limited to your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other similar information that you provide the Company (<strong>“Personal Information”</strong>) when it is voluntarily submitted to us, including when you log on directly, or using a social network or other third-party log-in.</p>
<p>Information We Collect Automatically</p>
<p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Service, Arkadium, as well as any third-party vendors and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Service is accessed and used (<strong>“Usage Information“</strong>).
Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, device type, an estimate of your geographic location associated with your IP address, the location of your mobile device, the page served, the time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests.
This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on which the Service is installed, how long they stay on that page, the type of content on that page, which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on and how they generally engage with that page.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Arkadium associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Arkadium treats it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>
<strong>IP Addresses and Device Identifiers</strong>
</p>
<p>We also automatically collect the internet protocol (<strong>“IP“</strong>) address or other unique identifier (<strong>“Device Identifier“</strong>) for each computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “Device“) you use to access the Service.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify each Device by its Device Identifier.
An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet.
Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a “dynamic” address).
Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed identifiable.
This is because with some broadband connections your IP Address doesn’t change (it is “static”) and could be associated with your personal computer.
We use your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve the website.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a small string of data sent by the Service that is stored in your Device and provided back to the Service each time you interact with the Service.
Cookies do not convey Personal Information about you.
they provide anonymous information to us regarding how you use the Service.
We may use session cookies, which are temporary cookies that disappear after you close your browser and/or persistent cookies, which remain on your hard drive after you close your browser and are reloaded when you open a new browser session.
In general, cookies can make it so that you do not need to log-in again to the Service once you have already done so, they help us and our partners better understand users’ interests in order to make improvements, they allow us to show you specific content recommendations that we think will be of particular interest to you, and they can make the Service load faster and more enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, disabling cookies may make certain features unavailable or not function optimally, and we may not be able to tailor our recommendations as well as we would be able to if you had not blocked the cookies.</p>
<p>
<strong>Log Files</strong>
</p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we and our third-party tracking-utility partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Sites and Service, to track users’ movements around the Sites and Service and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>
<strong>Web Beacon / Pixel tags</strong>
</p>
<p>A Web Beacon, also called a single-pixel (1×1), clear GIF, or pixel tag, is a transparent image embedded in a webpage or HTML-based e-mail that allows us to collect web log information.
Web log information is gathered when you visit one of our websites by the computer that hosts our website (called a “webserver”).
We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened.
This information may include the time and date of a page view, the webpage where the beacon is placed, the pages you visited, the website you came from, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 7), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g., AOL).
No Personal Information is detected by web beacons, but they can help us track online usage patterns of our users and gauge the effectiveness of our activities anonymously by, among other things, enabling us to see whether particular webpages are viewed or e-mails are opened by recipients.
While you may not decline web beacons, you may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
However, if you disable the cookies associated with a beacon, some services may not function properly.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Analytics</strong>
</p>
<p>We use third-party analytics services to analyze various data.
We currently use Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States.
Google Analytics does not identify users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
We use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us understand website traffic and webpage usage.
You can find out more about the information Google collects, and controlling the information collected by Google at &nbsp;https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.&nbsp.
You can find more about the cookies used by Google at &nbsp;https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage.</p>
<p>We also use Microsoft Application Insights.
Application Insights places a cookie in the browser of the visitor of the web pages which allows for an analysis of your use of the site.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website is usually transferred to a server of Microsoft in the US and stored there.
This information may include your activity on the site, as well as your operating system, browser, screen resolution, approximate location, and IP address.
On our behalf as a website operator, Microsoft will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other information on website usage and internet related services to us as a website operator.
All this information is anonymous statistical data and referencing these to a person is not possible.
The evaluations serve only for troubleshooting and optimization of the website and the application.
Further information from Microsoft about privacy can be found at: &nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Privacy/default.aspx</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Technologies</strong>
</p>
<p>We may also use other kinds of local storage, such as “flash cookies,” authentication tokens, and HTML5 local storage.
Like cookies, these technologies are stored on your computer, albeit in different parts of your device, and perform similar functions.
They can also be used to store certain information about your preferences.
Your Internet browser may allow you to disable HTML5 or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage by changing your browser setting.
Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of the Service.</p>
<p>

Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers in any country where we do business.
