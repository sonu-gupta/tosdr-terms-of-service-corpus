<p>In close cooperation with our hosting provider, we make every effort to protect the databases from outside access, data loss, misuse or falsification.
No personal details are stored when you access our websites.

Site usage data is in no way linked with personal data.</p>
<p>In order to make regular improvements to the service we offer, we use a web analytics system known as eTracker.

No data is supplied for any other purpose or to any third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to testing eTracker, we are also looking at the web analysis solution Matomo (formerly Piwik).
Matomo provides us with additional useful information and also delivers better data protection.
For the sake of comparison we will initially be using both tools.
However, no data will be used for other purposes, or be passed on to third parties.</p>
