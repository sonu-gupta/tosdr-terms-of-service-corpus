<p>If you record any meetings, these are stored until deleted.
Please remember to remove them when they're no longer needed to free up storage for other users.
</p>
<p>If meetings are recorded, the chat log is stored with the meeting to make it viewable in the recording.
</p>
<p>Unlisted recordings are only viewable by the room owner (with one exception).
If made public, they will be listed on that room's page.
</p>
<p>Administrators (currently only Amolith) can join any in-progress meeting and view any recording regardless of whether or not it's publicly accessible.
However, I will refrain from doing so.
I'm busy enough as it is and simply don't have the time much less interest.

all work just as well as legitimate ones.
