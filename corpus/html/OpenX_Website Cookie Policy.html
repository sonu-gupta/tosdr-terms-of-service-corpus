What are cookies? <p>We use cookies on our website.
A cookie is a very small text document containing a string of characters that, in many cases, uniquely identifies your web browser or device.

Each cookie allows its issuer to identify certain information about the browser or device on which it is stored, such as whether it is a computer, tablet, or mobile device.</p>
<p>OpenX may place cookies on your browser or device every time you come back to our website or load a new page on our website.</p>
