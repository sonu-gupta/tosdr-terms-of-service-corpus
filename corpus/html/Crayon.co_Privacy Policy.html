<p>&nbsp;</p> 5.
Disclosures of Your Personal Information
<p>We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table <em>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</em>&nbsp;above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third Parties as set out in the <em>Glossary</em>.</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets.
Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them.
If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law.
We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 6.
International Transfers
<p>We largely operate in the United States (“U.S.”), and therefore, if you reside outside of the U.S.
you understand and agree that your personal information may be transferred to, stored or processed in, the U.S.
by us and our third party hosting providers.
Furthermore, you understand that U.S.
law may not afford the same level of protection to personal information as those afforded in your country.
Personal information may be transferred for the performance of a contract or as required for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request or to establish or exercise our legal rights.</p>
<p>If you are based in the European Union and when we are given access to your personal information by one of our clients in connection with services we provide to them, then we rely on our client data controllers’ written instructions to ensure that any transfer of your personal information to us and to our service providers based outside the European Economic Area is performed in accordance with applicable EU law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 7.
Data Security
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
They will only process your personal information on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Notice will be given promptly, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures necessary for Crayon or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to assure or restore the integrity of the data system.
Crayon may delay notification if Crayon or a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, unless and until Crayon or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.
If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at&nbsp;privacy@crayon.co</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 8.
Data Retention
<p>
<strong>How long will you use my personal information for?</strong>
</p>
<p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.
We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your information: see <em>your rights and choices</em>&nbsp;below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 9.

<strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and the best and most secure experience.
We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests.
We do not use your personal information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
<p>
<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your information where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
<p>
<strong>Comply with a legal obligation </strong>means processing your personal information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p>
<p>
<strong>Consent</strong> means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of your wishes by which you, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal information relating to you.</p>
<p>
<strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Service providers acting as processors who provide IT, payment processing, analytics, and system administration services.

<li>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p>
<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request").
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</p>
<p>
<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with applicable law.
Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p>
<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>
<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want us to establish the information's accuracy.</li>
<li>Where our use of the information is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
<li>Where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
<li>You have objected to our use of your information, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p>
<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal information.
However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
