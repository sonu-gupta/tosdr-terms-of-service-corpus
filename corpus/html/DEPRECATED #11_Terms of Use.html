<li>a.
<strong>Microsoft account.</strong> You’ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services.
Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.
<ul>
<li>i.
<strong>Creating an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online.
You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account.
In some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you.
If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account.
Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.
If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.
You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity.
To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential.
You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.</li>
<li>ii.
<strong>Account Use.</strong> You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active.
This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services.
If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you.
Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.
You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.
You must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account.
If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.
Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content.
If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656.</li>
<li>iii.
<strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of “majority” where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.
If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help.
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.</li>
<li>iv.
<strong>Closing Your Account.</strong>
<ul>
<li>1.
You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason.
To close your Microsoft account, please visit https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx.
When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, we will put it in a suspended state for 60 days just in case you change your mind.
After that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed.
Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed.
Logging back in during that 60-day period will reactivate your Microsoft account.</li>
<li>2.
If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen.
First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately.
Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).
You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed.
Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b.
<strong>Work or School Accounts.</strong> You can sign into certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address.
If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised.
You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply.
If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.
</li>
<li>c.
<strong>Additional Equipment/Data Plans.</strong> To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan.
You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone.
You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment.
Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees.
Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.
</li>
<li>d.
<strong>Service Notifications.</strong> When there’s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications.
If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases.
We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages).
<strong>Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.</strong>
</li>
<li>e.
<strong>Support.</strong> Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com.
Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified.
Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services.
</li>
<li>f.
<strong>Ending your Services.</strong> If your Services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends.
Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).
As a result you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services).
You should have a regular backup plan.
Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.
If you have canceled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be canceled immediately.

<strong>Payment Terms.</strong> If you purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>a.
<strong>Charges.</strong> If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge.
The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise.
The price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes.
You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.
Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered.
We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.
Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.
Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li>
<li>b.
<strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.
You can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount.
Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network.
You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions.
Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.</li>
<li>c.
<strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate.
(ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method.
and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force.
We may bill you (a) in advance.
(b) at the time of purchase.
(c) shortly after purchase.
or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services.
Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services.
We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.</li>
<li>d.
<strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft.
You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services.
We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services.
By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, <strong>"Electronic Payments"</strong>).
Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period.
If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.</li>
<li>e.
<strong>Online Statement and Errors.</strong> Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and print your statement.
For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing into your account at www.skype.com (https://www.skype.com).
This is the only billing statement that we provide.
If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill.
We will then promptly investigate the charge.
If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund.
If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.</li>
<li>f.
<strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.
If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.
No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.
We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.
If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.
This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.
For more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).</li>
<li>g.
<strong>Canceling the Services.</strong> You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause.
Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service.
To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website.
You can request a refund from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286).
You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation.

<li>h.
<strong>Trial-Period Offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.</li>
<li>i.
<strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services.
Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.</li>
<li>j.
<strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change.
If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect.
If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.</li>
<li>k.
<strong>Payments to You.</strong> If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you.
You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you.
You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment.
If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment.
You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this.
We may reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.</li>
<li>l.
<strong>Gift Cards.</strong> Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions).
Information on Skype gift cards is available on Skype’s Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).</li>
<li>m.
<strong>Bank Account Payment Method.</strong> You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method.
Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house ("<strong>ACH</strong>") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area ("<strong>SEPA</strong>") or "iDEAL" in the Netherlands).
Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the “mandate” in the case of SEPA) also apply.
You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method.
By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits.
You understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account.
Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error.
Laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account.
By registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms.</li>

</ul>Top of pageBinding Arbitration and Class Action WaiverBinding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver<p>15.
<strong>Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or, If a Business, Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the United States.</strong> We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally.
If we can’t, you and we agree to <strong>binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury</strong>.
Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA.
<strong>Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed.
Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.
</strong>"We," "our," and "us" includes Microsoft, Skype (see section 10) and Microsoft’s affiliates.</p>
<ul>
<li>a.
<strong>Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP.</strong> The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be.
It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your Microsoft account, advertising, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, <strong>except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights</strong>.</li>
<li>b.
<strong>Mail a Notice of Dispute First.</strong> If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S.
Mail to <strong>Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A.</strong>.
Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want.
A form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499.
We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you.
After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.</li>
<li>c.
<strong>Small Claims Court Option.</strong> Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court if you meet the court’s requirements in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A..</li>
<li>d.
<strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules).
For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.
To start an arbitration, submit the form available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us.
In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington if your dispute is with Microsoft.
You choose.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.
Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim.
But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.</li>
<li>e.
<strong>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</strong>
<ul>
<li>i.
<strong>Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less.</strong> We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.
(ii) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any.
and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.</li>
<li>ii.
<strong>Disputes Involving More than $75,000.</strong> The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f.
<strong>Conflict with AAA Rules.</strong> These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</li>
<li>g.
<strong>Must File Within One Year.</strong> You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes—see section 15.a) within one year from when it first could be filed.
Otherwise, it’s permanently barred.</li>
<li>h.
<strong>Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.</strong> You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S.
Mail to the address in section 15.b.
If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.</li>
<li>i.
<strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of section 15 (Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class-wide or representative arbitration, section 15 will be unenforceable in its entirety.</li>
</ul>Top of pageMiscellaneousMiscellaneous<p>16.
<strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This section, and sections 1, 9 (for amounts incurred before the end of these Terms), 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 and those that by their terms apply after the Terms end will survive any termination or cancellation of these Terms.
We may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you.
You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Services.
This is the entire agreement between you and Microsoft for your use of the Services.
It supersedes any prior agreements between you and Microsoft regarding your use of the Services.
All parts of these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law.
If a court or arbitrator holds that we can't enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms won't change.
Section 15.i says what happens if parts of section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable.
Section 15.i prevails over this section if inconsistent with it.
Except for section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) these Terms are solely for your and our benefit.
they aren’t for the benefit of any other person, except for Microsoft’s successors and assigns.</p>

<ul>
<li>a.
<strong>Microsoft account.</strong> You’ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services.
Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.
<ul>
<li>i.
<strong>Creating an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online.
You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account.
In some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you.
If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account.
Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.
If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.
You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity.
To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential.
You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.</li>
<li>ii.
<strong>Account Use.</strong> You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active.
This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services.
If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you.
Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.
You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.
You must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account.
If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.
Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content.
If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656.</li>
<li>iii.
<strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of “majority” where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.
If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help.
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.</li>
<li>iv.
<strong>Closing Your Account.</strong>
<ul>
<li>1.
You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason.
To close your Microsoft account, please visit https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx.
When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, we will put it in a suspended state for 60 days just in case you change your mind.
After that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed.
Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed.
Logging back in during that 60-day period will reactivate your Microsoft account.</li>
<li>2.
If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen.
First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately.
Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).
You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed.
Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b.
<strong>Work or School Accounts.</strong> You can sign into certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address.
If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised.
You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply.
If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.
</li>
<li>c.
<strong>Additional Equipment/Data Plans.</strong> To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan.
You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone.
You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment.
Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees.
Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.
</li>
<li>d.
<strong>Service Notifications.</strong> When there’s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications.
If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases.
We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages).
<strong>Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.</strong>
</li>
<li>e.
<strong>Support.</strong> Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com.
Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified.
Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services.
</li>
<li>f.
<strong>Ending your Services.</strong> If your Services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends.
Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).
As a result you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services).
You should have a regular backup plan.
Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.
If you have canceled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be canceled immediately.

<ul>
<li>a.
<strong>Charges.</strong> If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge.
The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise.
The price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes.
You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.
Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered.
We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.
Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.
Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li>
<li>b.
<strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.
You can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount.
Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network.
You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions.
Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.</li>
<li>c.
<strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate.
(ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method.
and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force.
We may bill you (a) in advance.

We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.</li>
<li>d.
<strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft.
You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services.
We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services.
By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, <strong>"Electronic Payments"</strong>).
Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period.
If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.</li>
<li>e.

This is the only billing statement that we provide.
If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill.
We will then promptly investigate the charge.
If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund.
If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.</li>
<li>f.
<strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.
If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.
No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.
We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.
If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.
This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.
For more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).</li>
<li>g.
<strong>Canceling the Services.</strong> You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause.
Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service.
To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website.
You can request a refund from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286).

<li>i.
<strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services.
Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.</li>
<li>j.
<strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change.
If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect.
If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.</li>
<li>k.
<strong>Payments to You.</strong> If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you.
You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you.
You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment.
If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment.
You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this.
We may reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.</li>
<li>l.
<strong>Gift Cards.</strong> Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions).

<li>m.
<strong>Bank Account Payment Method.</strong> You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method.
Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house ("<strong>ACH</strong>") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area ("<strong>SEPA</strong>") or "iDEAL" in the Netherlands).
Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the “mandate” in the case of SEPA) also apply.
You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method.
By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits.
You understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account.
Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error.
Laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account.
By registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms.</li>

</ul>Full textBinding Arbitration and Class Action WaiverBinding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver15_bindingArbitrationSummary<p>15.
<strong>Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or, If a Business, Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the United States.</strong> We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally.
If we can’t, you and we agree to <strong>binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury</strong>.
Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA.
<strong>Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed.
Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.
</strong>"We," "our," and "us" includes Microsoft, Skype (see section 10) and Microsoft’s affiliates.</p>
<ul>
<li>a.
<strong>Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP.</strong> The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be.
It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your Microsoft account, advertising, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, <strong>except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights</strong>.</li>
<li>b.
<strong>Mail a Notice of Dispute First.</strong> If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S.
Mail to <strong>Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A.</strong>.
Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want.
A form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499.
We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you.
After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.</li>
<li>c.
<strong>Small Claims Court Option.</strong> Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court if you meet the court’s requirements in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A..</li>
<li>d.
<strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules).
For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.
To start an arbitration, submit the form available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us.
In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington if your dispute is with Microsoft.
You choose.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.
Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim.
But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.</li>
<li>e.
<strong>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</strong>
<ul>
<li>i.
<strong>Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less.</strong> We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.
(ii) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any.
and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.</li>
<li>ii.
<strong>Disputes Involving More than $75,000.</strong> The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f.
<strong>Conflict with AAA Rules.</strong> These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</li>
<li>g.
<strong>Must File Within One Year.</strong> You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes—see section 15.a) within one year from when it first could be filed.
Otherwise, it’s permanently barred.</li>
<li>h.
<strong>Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.</strong> You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S.
Mail to the address in section 15.b.
If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.</li>
<li>i.
<strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of section 15 (Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class-wide or representative arbitration, section 15 will be unenforceable in its entirety.</li>
</ul>Full textMiscellaneousMiscellaneous16_17_18_miscellaneousSummary<p>16.
<strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This section, and sections 1, 9 (for amounts incurred before the end of these Terms), 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 and those that by their terms apply after the Terms end will survive any termination or cancellation of these Terms.

Section 15.i says what happens if parts of section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable.
Section 15.i prevails over this section if inconsistent with it.
Except for section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) these Terms are solely for your and our benefit.
they aren’t for the benefit of any other person, except for Microsoft’s successors and assigns.</p>
