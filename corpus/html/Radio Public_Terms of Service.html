They govern your use of RadioPublic’s mobile apps, sites, services, products, and content (“Services”).</p>
<p>By using RadioPublic, you agree to these Terms.
If you don’t agree to any of the Terms, you can’t use RadioPublic, alas.</p>

<p>
<strong>Third party content</strong>
</p>
<p>RadioPublic displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds, sites, publishers, networks and producers, and downloads and provides online listening to podcast files directly from each podcast’s third-party servers.
These third parties may have their own privacy policies and terms of use, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>
<p>RadioPublic also contains links to websites, services, content and advertisements that we don’t own or control.
We don’t necessarily endorse or assume responsibility for those things, either.</p>
<p>We don’t pre-screen anyone’s content.
However, we have the right to review and remove or disable access to any content through RadioPublic for any reason.
We assume no liability for anything that you or anyone else publishes through RadioPublic.</p>
