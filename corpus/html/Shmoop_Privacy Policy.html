Privacy Policy
<p>As of April 28, 2020</p>
<p>Shmoop's Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand what information we collect from you and how that information is used by Shmoop University, Inc.
(collectively, “Shmoop,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
Your trust and confidence are essential to our success.
Shmoop respects your privacy and will not sell or share your personally identifiable information with another party without your expressed consent, other than as described in "Exceptions to Sharing Personally Identifiable Information" below.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the websites and domains on which it is posted, including, but not limited to, www.shmoop.com (the “Site”) and to the various education tools and services we offer on the Site (the “Services”).
It does not cover:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Information collected by third-party websites linked from Shmoop</li>
<li>Information collected off-line</li>
</ul>
<p>Your use of the Shmoop Site and Services constitutes your consent to this Privacy Policy and Shmoop's Terms of Use.
Capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy either have the meanings given them in this Privacy Policy or in the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Shmoop may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to accurately reflect the Shmoop Site and Shmoop Services and our privacy practices or changes in the law.
Please review this Policy frequently for any changes.
The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of information about you and will be located at https://www.shmoop.com/privacy-policy.
If Shmoop makes material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a notice on the Site or sending an email to the email address we have on file for you or that you provided in your Shmoop account.
Please ensure your email address remains current so you will receive updates.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please email us at support@shmoop.com.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are a resident of the European Union or California, you have additional rights as set forth below.</p> Information We Collect <p> We collect two types of information from you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Information you voluntarily provide when registering or participating in activities or using Services on Shmoop.
and</li>
<li>Information collected automatically by using cookies and other tracking technologies from your computer or other device that you use to access the Site or Services, including your geographic location when you use Shmoop.</li>
</ul>
<p> All personally identifiable information collected from the Site or through the Services will not be shared with any other entity without your expressed consent, other than as described in “Exceptions to Sharing Personally Identifiable Information” below.
</p> Registration <p>To use some parts of our Site or certain of our Services, you must register with Shmoop and create an account (“Registration Information”).
When you register, we collect personally identifiable information such as your name and email address.
You may provide other personally identifiable information voluntarily (e.g., year in school, gender), but it is not required for registration.
If you register for a subscription or purchase a product at our Site, then we may collect credit card and debit card information to provide to our payment processor, including credit/debit card numbers, expiration dates, CV numbers, billing address, shipping address, date of order, payment information, and the product or subscription ordered.<br>
We use this Registration Information to contact you about the Services on our Site about which you have expressed interest, to process subscriptions, and provide you the Services you have purchased or for which you have registered.
</p> Other Voluntarily Submitted Information - User Generated Content <p>The Services also allow users to submit information and content through the Site and in connection with the Services.
This includes, but is not limited to the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Any response, content, or information you provide in connection with the Services.
For example, we collect your answers to test prep questions, essays you might write, responses to survey questions or polls, responses to assessment questions in the Heartbeat™ tool, and notes and other content you create.</li>
<li>We track your progress and performance in connection with the Services you use.</li>
<li>We collect your contact and other information you provide when providing us feedback, making inquiries, or asking for customer support.
</li>
<li>We collect the optional profile information that you wish to share with other users of the Site and Services.</li>
<li>We collect other information that you submit voluntarily through our Shmoop message boards, notes, conversations, and other communications.
</li>
</ul> Automatically Collected Information <p>In addition to the information you voluntarily send us while visiting Shmoop, like most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, mobile device ID, advertising identifiers, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>Shmoop uses third-party products called Google Analytics, Google AdSense, HotJar and Rhapsody that use cookies and/or other tracking mechanisms embedded in our pages to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site in the aggregate, such as total visitors to the site and length of visit.
We use this usage information for internal purposes.
We do not share your personally identifiable information with these third parties.
</p> Our Use of Information <p>We use the information that we collect on our Site and through the Services for the following purposes: </p>
<ul>
<li>provide access to the Site and to provide you with requested Services and customer support and to process and respond to your inquiries.
</li>
<li>personalize, customize, measure, and improve our Services, content, and advertising and otherwise to enhance your experience of the Site.
</li>

and take any other action as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties without your expressed consent, other than as described in “Exceptions to Sharing Personally Identifiable Information” below.
We may provide information in the aggregate about our users to third parties for other purposes, but in this case, all personally identifiable information will be removed.</p> Student Privacy - FERPA <p>Shmoop may have access to student education records that are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C.
1232g, et seq.
and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
This information is considered confidential and is, therefore, protected from disclosure, except with the consent of the student or in the case of a minor, a parent or legal guardian, or other person authorized to consent on behalf of the student.
</p>
<p>To the extent that Shmoop has access to “education records” subject to FERPA, it does so as a service provider to educational institutions.
We will only use such education records and personally identifiable information contained therein for the purposes of providing Services to users that access our Services under our contract with the educational institution.
We will not use such information to market to the users except to the extent permitted by law or by our contract with the educational institution.
</p>
<p>Except as required or permitted by law, or with consent as noted above, we shall not disclose or share such education records with any third party unless (a) such disclosure is permitted by the terms of our contract with the particular educational institution from which we received the educational records, and (b) the third party has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the education records to the same extent required of Shmoop under its contract with the educational institution.</p>
<p>In the event any person(s) seek to access protected education records, we will only retrieve such data or information upon receipt of, and in accordance with, written directions, if allowed by law.
If we receive a court order or lawfully issued subpoena seeking the release of such data or information, Shmoop will provide notification to relevant users with a copy of the court order or lawfully issued subpoena prior to releasing the requested data or information, if allowed by law or judicial and/or administrative order.</p>
<p>If a student or his or her parent would like to request to access, modify, refuse further collection of, or delete a student’s personally identifiable information that we have been provided under a contract with a school or school district, please contact your school or school district with your request as we may not be able to respond to such requests directly under our contractual confidentiality obligations with the schools and school districts.
</p> Children's Privacy
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of persons less than 13 years of age (“child” or “children”) who use our Site or Services.
This policy explains our information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to information provided by children and is in accordance with the U.S.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
Shmoop does not knowingly permit any child to register directly for the Site or Services unless we reasonably believe, or have received assurances from the subscribing user or in the case of use under a plan with an educational institution, the administrator, that the child’s parent has consented to such registration and use of the Site and Services.
If Shmoop learns that personally identifiable information of a child has been collected on the Site without parental consent, then we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.
If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has a registered account with the Site without your consent, please email Shmoop at support@shmoop.com and request that Shmoop delete that child's personally identifiable information from its systems.</p> Registration and Use of the Site
<p>When a child requests to register for the Site or Services, Shmoop will seek consent from the child's identified parent or guardian (“Parent”).
We may ask the child to provide certain information for notification and security purposes, including the Parent's email address, the child’s first name and gender, the child’s username, and password.
We may also ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages.
Please note that children can choose whether to share their information with us, but certain features cannot function without it.
As a result, children may not be able to access certain features if required information has not been provided.
We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.
Parents may also agree to the collection and use of their child’s information, but not allow disclosure to third parties.</p>
<p>Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, on any child-targeted site or application, or in any instance where we ask for age and determine the user is less than 13 years of age, we will ask for a Parent email address before we collect any personally identifiable information from the child.
If you believe your child is participating in an activity that collects personally identifiable information and you or another Parent have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking your consent, please feel free to contact us at support@shmoop.com.
We will not use Parent emails provided for parental consent purposes to market to the Parent, unless the Parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.
</p>
<p>If you are a Parent and wish to provide direct consent for your child’s registration on the Site and Services, you must first register through the Site and affirmatively verify you are the child’s Parent and consent to the collection of the child’s personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>If, in addition to collecting content that includes personally identifiable information, Shmoop also plans to post the content publicly, share it with a third party for the third party’s own use or allow the child to post content publicly, we will obtain a higher level of parental consent as required by COPPA (verifiable parental consent).
Methods by which we will obtain verifiable parental consent include, but are not limited to, requiring a signed consent form by mail, fax or electronic scan, asking for a credit card or other online payment method for verification, or having the Parent speak to a trained customer service representative by telephone or video chat.
We will not post a child’s personally identifiable information or content publicly or except as permitted by law or as stated in the section entitled “When Information Collected From Children is Available to Others,” share such personally identifiable information or content with a third party for their third party’s own use without first obtaining verifiable parental consent.</p> Teacher or Administrator Consent <p>With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personally identifiable information from children.
Schools should always notify parents about these activities.</p> Email Contact with a Child <p>On occasion, and as permitted by COPPA, in order to respond to a question or request from a child, Shmoop may need to ask for the child’s online contact information, such as an email address.
Shmoop will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.</p>
<p>In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child’s online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once.
In such instances we will retain the child’s online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such as marketing.
Whenever we collect a child’s online contact information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a Parent email address in order to notify the Parent about the collection and use of the child’s information, as well as to provide the Parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.
On some occasions a child may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a Parent may be required to "opt-out" of each communication individually.</p> Persistent identifiers: <p>When children interact with us, certain information may automatically be collected, both to make our Site and Services more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business.
As discussed in this Privacy Policy, examples include the type of computer operating system, the child’s IP address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our Site, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider.
This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers (which we define under the “Cookies.
Do Not Track” section of this Privacy Policy).
This information may be collected by Shmoop or by third-party businesses for the purposes explained in the “Cookies.
Do Not Track” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from children on our Site or Services for other purposes, if required by COPPA, we will notify parents and obtain consent prior to such collection.</p> When Information Collected From Children is Available to Others <p>In addition to those instances where a child’s personally identifiable information is posted publicly (after receiving verifiable parental consent), we also may share or disclose personally identifiable information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may share information with our service providers if it is necessary for them to perform a technology support function for us, or for other legitimate educational purposes.</li>
<li>We may disclose personally identifiable information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personally identifiable information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request.
(ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Site.
(iii) to protect the security or integrity of our Site, Services and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers.
or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.
</li>
</ul> Parental Choices and Control <p>At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to use and collect further personally identifiable information from their children in association with a particular account, and can request that we delete from our records the personally identifiable information we have collected in connection with that account.
Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service.</p>
<p>Where a child has registered for a Shmoop account, we use two methods to allow Parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their children:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parents can request access to and delete their child’s personally identifiable information by logging onto the child’s account.
Parents will need their child’s username and password.</li>
<li>Parents can contact us to request access to, change, or delete their child’s personally identifiable information at support@shmoop.com.</li>
</ol>
<p>In any correspondence such as email or mail, please include the child’s username and the Parent’s email address and telephone number.
To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a Parent’s identity before granting access to any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We will retain your child’s information for as long as their account is active or as needed to provide them services.
If you wish to cancel your child’s account or request that we no longer use that information to provide them Services, please contact us at support@shmoop.com.
We will retain and use their information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p>If we make material changes to how we use personally identifiable information collected from children, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain parental consent for the new uses of the child’s personally identifiable information.</p> Our Communication with You <p> After you register with Shmoop, we may contact you in several ways.
Please see our contact us page to opt-out of specific types of messages.
</p> Customer Service <p>When you register, we will send you a welcome message from Shmoop.
We may also respond to your customer service inquiries, your suggestions, or your requests to manage your account.
We will communicate with you by email or phone, in accordance with your preferences.</p> Special Offers <p>We may send our users emails with information about special offers and promotions.
You may opt-out of such communications at the time of registration and on our Contact page or by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the email.</p> Newsletters, Product Updates, and Notifications <p>YWe may send our users newsletters, product updates, and other marketing-related notifications by email.
You may opt-out from such communication on our Contact page or by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the email.</p> Service Announcements <p>TWe may send our users updates regarding the Service or their account.
These are sent to all registrants of Shmoop on occasions when a significant service change or disruption occurs.
You cannot opt-out of such Service-related or account-related emails.
</p> Accessing, Changing and Managing Your Information
<p>You can access or change your personal profile and contact information or delete your account by either logging into your account or contacting customer service at support@shmoop.com.
</p> Security of Your Information <p>The security of your information is important to us.
We use a number of measures to help protect the security of the personally identifiable information submitted to us.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and any information you transmit to Shmoop or submit through the Site or the Services is done so at your own risk.
If you have questions about security on our Site or Services, please contact us at support@shmoop.com.</p> Sharing Information within Shmoop Message Board, Site Sharing Features and Site Contributions <p>When you use our Site or Services, you have the option to make contributions including, but not limited to, your notes, comments, creative works, or information about yourself, available to other visitors to our Site or Services.</p>
<p>We will, generally, provide you with the option to control the privacy of your contributions or remove your contributions from the Site or Services.</p>
<p>If you use Shmoop’s message boards, chat rooms, conversations, or other Services on the Shmoop site, please be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<p>If you have not removed or marked private any given piece of identifiable information, Shmoop will assume that you are aware that it is viewable by other users of Shmoop and the public at large.
</p>
<p>If you have further questions about your contributions to this Site, please contact us.</p> Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information

</p> Cookies.
Do Not Track <p>Shmoop, along with our third-party service partners, vendors, and business partners may use cookies, locally stored objects, and web beacons to automatically collect information about your use of the Site.
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
We use both “persistent cookies,” which remain on your computer after you have closed your browser as well as “session cookies,” which exist only during a visitor’s online session and disappear from your computer when you close your browser.
Locally stored objects or “flash cookies” are data files that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit and are a way for websites to store information for later use.
Locally stored objects are different than cookies because they are stored in different parts of your computer than cookies.
Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.
We use cookies, locally stored objects, and web beacons to make your experience with our Site more efficient and customized.
Our cookies do not include any sensitive information, but they do help us learn which of our Site pages are visited and what tools and Services are most often used.
Please note that in order to use Shmoop, your web browser must be configured to accept cookies.</p>
<p>The Site may include links to other websites and other content from third-party businesses.
We permit third parties to track your actions through cookies and web beacons over time and across different websites or platforms.</p>
<p>In addition, you may be able to adjust your browser settings or other settings so that “do not track” requests are sent to the websites and mobile applications that you use.
However, Shmoop will not disable tracking technology that may be active on the Site in response to any “do not track” requests that are sent to the Site.</p> Testimonials and User Feedback <p>From time to time, we will publish comments from users who have shared positive testimonials about our Site and Services.
When we publish such content, we will identify those users only by their first and last name or a screenname, and their city, state, and school.
We may also retweet your feedback and testimonials through our Twitter account, provided that we will not retweet feedback and testimonials from children under 13 without parental consent.</p> International Users - Applicable Law <p>Shmoop gathers, aggregates, processes, stores, discloses, and disposes of personally identifiable information submitted to the company according to applicable United States law.
To use the Site and Services, users agree that their personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United States and processed by Shmoop to provide the Site and Services as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
If you are not a United States resident, your use of the Site and Services is an acknowledgement and agreement that, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, Shmoop may gather and process your information outside your resident jurisdiction and in the United States.
In using the Site, you acknowledge that United States law may offer levels of protection for personally identifiable information that differ from or less protective of your rights than those available in your resident country or jurisdiction.</p> EU Data Subjects
<p>If you are a resident of the European Union, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) to the extent it is applicable to your personally identifiable information (for purposes of this section, this term is the same as “personal data” as defined in the GDPR).

<p>We rely on the following legal basis for processing of your personally identifiable information:</p>

The collection and processing of personally identifiable information based on your consent is in accordance with Art.
6 para.
1(a) GDPR.</li>
<li>Necessary to perform a contract: we process personally identifiable information as necessary for the performance of contracts with you, including to provide Services.

Such processing is based on Art.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Right to Object to Processing: You have the right to request that we cease processing your personally identifiable information for marketing activities, including profiling for statistical purposes where such processing is based upon our legitimate business interests, unless we are able to demonstrate a compelling legitimate basis for such processing or we need to process your personally identifiable information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim.</li>
<li>Right to Restrict Processing: You have the right to request that we limit the processing of your personally identifiable information: <ul>
<li>while we are evaluating or in the process of responding to a request by you to update or correct your personally identifiable information where such processing is unlawful and you do not want us to delete your data;</li>

<li>where you have submitted an objection to processing based upon our legitimate business interests, pending our response to such request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Portability Requests: You have the right to request that we provide you or a third party that you designate with certain of your personally identifiable information in a commonly used, machine readable format.

Although we do not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing, you may make one request each year by emailing us at support@shmoop.com or sending a letter to:</p>
<p>Shmoop University Inc.,<br> PO Box 15550<br>Scottsdale, AZ 85267</p> Nevada Opt-Out <p>Although we do not sell the personally identifiable information of Nevada residents, out of an abundance of caution and according to Nevada law, any Nevada resident who wants to opt out of the sale of personally identifiable information may submit a request by contacting us at support@shmoop.com.
Please note that we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.</p> Your Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act <p>This California Privacy Notice supplements the Privacy Policy and contains the disclosures required under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).
For individuals who are California residents, the CCPA requires certain disclosures about the categories of personally identifiable information (for purposes of this section this is the same as “personal information” as defined in the CCPA) we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom we collect personally identifiable information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share it.</p>
<p>Please note that for California residents, the term personally identifiable information means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in the CCPA.
All other capitalized terms have the same meanings as given them in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>If you are a California resident who has provided personally identifiable information to Shmoop University, Inc., or a California resident that reasonably believes that Shmoop University, Inc., collected or stores their personally identifiable information, you may exercise your rights under the CCPA and submit your requests by emailing: support@shmoop.com.</p>
<p>Although we do not sell consumers’ personally identifiable information as defined under the CCPA, out of an abundance of caution and according to California law, any California consumer who wants to opt out of the sale of personally identifiable information may submit a request by contacting us at support@shmoop.com.
If we think the CCPA opt-out applies, we will process the request in accordance with the CCPA.
</p>
<p>You have the right to request Shmoop University Inc.
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disclose if we have collected personally identifiable information about you;</li>

and</li>
<li>Delete personally identifiable information we have collected about you (if you satisfy the conditions set out in the CCPA).</li>

<p>In order to submit a request, we will need to verify your identity.
If you have an account with us that is password-protected, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account.</p>
<p>If you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns “categories” of personally identifiable information collected, we can request from you two data points of personally identifiable information to verify your identity.
If you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns specific personally identifiable information, we can request from you at least three data points of personally identifiable information as well as a signed declaration with penalty of perjury to verify your identity.</p>
<p> Please note that following your verified request, we will send you your personally identifiable information from the following email address: support@shmoop.com.
(Any response to your request, including any personally identifiable information may be sent as an encrypted file.)</p>
<p>Please note that once you have submitted a request, we will send you a receipt, acknowledging your request, within 10 business days.
If, for some reason, you do not receive such a receipt within 10 business days of your submitted request, please send us an email to support@shmoop.com as an error may have occurred.
</p>
<p>We will process and respond to your request within 45 calendar days after it is received (in some cases, as is allowed under the CCPA, this process may be extended by an additional 45-90 calendar days).</p>
<p>Please note you may only make two requests to know in a 12-month period, and the information provided need only cover the 12-month period prior to our receipt of your request.
</p>
<p>As a California resident, you also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.
We may require proof that you have designated the authorized agent to act on your behalf and to verify your identity directly with us.
Please contact us at support@shmoop.com for more information if you wish to submit a request through an authorized agent.</p>
