<strong>Retention and Deletion of Personal Data</strong>
</p>
<p>This section sets out our data retention policies and procedure, which are designed to help ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of personal data.</p>
<p>Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.</p>
<p>We will retain your personal data as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>[personal data category or categories]&nbsp;</em>will be retained for a minimum period of&nbsp;<em>[26 months]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reset on new activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The retention period for a specific user will reset with each new event from that user (thus setting the expiration date to current time plus retention period).
For example, if data retention is set to 26 months but a user initiates a new session every month, then that user’s identifier is refreshed every month and never reaches the 26-month expiry.
If the user doesn’t initiate a new session before the retention period expires, then that user’s data is deleted.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</li>
