<dt>Revision to this Privacy Policy</dt>
<dd>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in accordance with the law.
If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on our websites or by sending you emails or other notifications, and we will update the Last Updated Date above to indicate when such changes became effective.</dd>
<dt>What Information We Collect about You</dt>
<dd>Your information is the data relating to you, which can be used to identify you directly or indirectly.
We collect and process your information to provide and improve our Services for you, to administer your use of our Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
We will be transparent about the collection and use of your information so that you can make informed decisions.
You are not required to provide us with the information that we have requested, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our Products and Services or to respond to any queries you may have.</dd>
<dd>We collect the following information about you:</dd>
<dd>Basic Subscription Information.
If you create an account in connection with your use of any of the Services (“<b>Account</b>” or “<b>WPS ID</b>”), either through our Sites or when you download and install our Products, we’ll collect certain information about you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and credit card information (“<b>PII</b>”).
If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your accounts with certain third-party social networking services such as Google, Facebook or Twitter (each, an “<b>SNS Account</b>”), we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.
If you create an Account, we may also collect other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</dd>
<dd>Information Collected Using Cookies and Other Web Technologies.
Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</dd>
<dd>“<b>Cookies</b>” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services.
We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services.
We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and Web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.
Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser.
Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies.
Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services.
Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive on the basis of related arrangement.
Please note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies but not use of Cookies by such third parties.</dd>
<dd>“<b>Web Beacons</b>” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.
Unlike Cookies which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on Web pages (or in an e-mail).</dd>
<dd>At the same time, our Services may include third-party tracking tools without limitation to individual cookies, APIs (application programming interface) and SDKs (software development kit) which belong to part of the third-party services providers on behalf of WPS to collect and analyze technical data from you.
WPS or aforementioned third-party services providers on behalf of WPS collect such data not to identify any specific individuality or personality of yours but to understand how you access and use the Services at general manner.
Such data helps us provide the Services for you, learn how the Services are used, and make the Services more useful to you.
The technical data collected by WPS and the aforementioned third-party services providers may include:</dd>
<ul>
<li>Your devices or software data, such as your Internet Protocol (“<b>IP</b>”) address, device identifier, region and language settings, Network provider, network settings and status, operating system, device storage, Android ID, Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs (collectively, “Mobile IDs”), User Agent and HDID, browser or Apps that you have installed, mobile websites that you have interacted with, and how you interact with them, including whether and how you interact with ads (including time-stamp information);</li>
<li>Your operation data, such as the aggregate number of time, frequency and activity of your use of our Services, and when you use contact management functions or interact with other persons or institutions through our Services, we may collect data relating to your contacts and your relationship with such contacts, we may also collect Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser’s website or downloaded the advertiser’s app;</li>
<li>The metadata shared by you, such as shooting, uploaded sharing photos or videos, as well as exact date, time, place, and other data stored when using our Services.</li>
</ul>
<dd>Information Related to Use of the Services.
Our servers automatically record certain data about how a person uses our Services (“<b>Log Data</b>”), including that of both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “<b>User</b>”).
Log Data may include certain data such as a User’s IP address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics.
We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding and tailoring features and functionalities of our Services to our Users’ needs and preferences.
We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying data about where our Services are used.
In addition, for the aforementioned purposes and providing better access to and experience of our Services for you, we may allow certain third parties to collect and use your information.</dd>
<dd>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device.
We may collect certain data sent by your mobile device when you use our Services, such as a device identifier, the number and type of your devices you use to connect to the Service, user settings, device storage, Android ID, Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs (collectively, “Mobile IDs”), HDID and the operating system of your devices (e.g., iOS, Android etc.), as well as data relating to your use of our Services.</dd>
<dd>Location Data.
When you use our Services, our third party services providers (such as Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook Analytics, Umeng, Flurry etc.) may collect and provide us with your location data by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location.
We may use such location data to improve and personalize our Services for you.</dd>
<dd>Information Received from Our Partners and Other Third Parties.
We also may link your subscription information with the data information we receive from our partners or other third parties ( such as Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook Analytics, Umeng, Flurry etc.) to help smoothly facilitate our Services for you, to better understand your needs and to provide you with better Services experience.
Use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</dd>
<dd>Contact Information for Technical Support.
