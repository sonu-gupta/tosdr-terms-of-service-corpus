         <b>OFFENSIVE Security’s ACADEMIC POLICY – TRY HARDER</b>
<p>At Offensive Security we train our students by developing their mindset.
We believe the “Try Harder” mindset is essential to be a successful security professional.&nbsp.
We develop this mindset through hands-on labs and exams.
We believe that working independently through the exercises and training materials is part of the journey necessary to gain this mindset.&nbsp.
To achieve our training goals, we do not provide our students with hints or answers.
Instead we expect them to ask targeted and researched questions and work independently through repeated trial and error to find solutions to the various challenges in our training and exams.&nbsp.
With these goals and spirit in mind, our Academic Policy describes the actions and behaviors expected of our students.</p>
<p>In this Academic Policy the phrase “Course Materials” means Offensive Security’s (a) course books and videos (b) course and exam lab machines and associated content (c) exam and lab report templates (d) any other non-public material Offensive Security supplies to its students.</p>
