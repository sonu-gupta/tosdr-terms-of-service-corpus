<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”), California residents have certain rights around Logitech's collection, use, and sharing of their personal information.
Logitech does not sell your personal information and will not do so in the future without providing you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of such sale as required by law.
Similarly, we do not offer financial incentives associated with our collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information.</p> Read more <p>

<p>Logitech collects various categories of personal information when you use the Service, including identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network or device activity information, geolocation data, and professional information.
A more detailed description of the information We collect and how we use it, the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information, and what information may be shared under different circumstances in the policy above.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal information has been collected about you, and to access that information.
You also have the right to request deletion of your personal information, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow Logitech to retain and use certain personal information notwithstanding your deletion request.
You can learn more about how to submit a data rights request through contact details located within this policy.
You may also send your request by email to privacy@logitech.com.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
An agent may submit a request on your behalf, but you must verify that your agent is authorized to do so.</p>
<p>Separate from the CCPA, California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask companies what personal information they share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or services to you unless you request such disclosure.
