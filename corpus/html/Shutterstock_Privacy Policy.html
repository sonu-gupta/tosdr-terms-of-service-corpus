<p>This Privacy Statement describes how Shutterstock manage personal information and respect your privacy.
This policy may be amended from time to time.
We encourage visitors to and users of our sites to regularly review our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>All "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" (which is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time.
To update your information and preferences, see the section entitled "Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences."</p>
<p>Shutterstock is made up of different legal entities.
This privacy notice is issued on behalf of the Shutterstock group of companies.
When we refer to "Shutterstock", "we", "us" or "our" in this privacy notice, we mean the Shutterstock entity that acts as the controller or processor of your information, as explained in more detail in the "Entities Collecting Personal Information" section below.</p>Privacy Shield Framework<p>Shutterstock participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield.
Shutterstock is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit the U.S.
Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.
[https://www.privacyshield.gov/list]</p>
<p>Shutterstock is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.
Shutterstock complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, UK, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Shutterstock is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
In certain situations, Shutterstock may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>Collection of Personal Information<p>As a visitor to the Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information.</p>
<p>However, when you register to use a Shutterstock site and order products or services as a Shutterstock subscriber in order to provide the services to you, we may collect the following Personal Information from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information such as your name, phone and fax numbers, address and email address.
and</li>
<li>Billing information such as the number, expiration date, card type and billing address of your credit card;</li>
<li>Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type.
and</li>
<li>Profile data, including your username and password, details about your purchases and the Content that you license from us.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit content to Shutterstock for licensing, you may be asked to provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information such as your name, phone number, primary address, and email address.</li>
<li>Shutterstock may verify this information by asking you to either: a) upload a scan of a government issued ID (which will be stored securely on our servers).
or b) provide a credit card number.
If used to verify your identity, your credit card number will be used solely for the purpose of verifying your name and address.
The credit card number will not be stored.</li>
<li>Payment and contributor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display name, content focus, camera equipment, and information about your skill level and creative process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.
If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>As is true of most websites, when you use the Site, Shutterstock or third party subprocessors contracted by Shutterstock may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services.
For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer.
We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services.
Shutterstock also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site.
To better understand the needs of our visitors to the Site we may occasionally match such information with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, and prevent abuse of our system, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submit to us with information from third-party sources.
For example, we may supplement your contact information with address information provided by the U.S.
Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database.
We may supplement the information that we collect directly from you with information stored in third-party databases, such as demographic information or company information in order to make it more likely that any marketing communications we send will be relevant and of interest to you.
You may find a list of any third-party subprocessors that we use to process information here.</p>
<p>When you download and use our Mobile Apps or Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, and operating system version.
We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or Services.</p>Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences<p>Upon request Shutterstock will provide you with information about and access to your Personal Information that we process.
