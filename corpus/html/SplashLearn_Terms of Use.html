What about my privacy?
SplashLearn takes the privacy of its users very seriously.
For the current SplashLearn Privacy Policy, please click here.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under thirteen (13).
We collect limited personal information (e.g.
first name and gender) about minors on the site, but only where you, the minor's parent or legal guardian, has provided that information to us during the registration process.
Such information is not shared with third parties and is only shared internally, as described in our Privacy Policy .
A child's usage information, such as scores from games and assessments is only shared in an aggregated anonymous manner and never in a way that could personally identify the minor.
For example, you might know your child's math scores rank in the top 10% for children in that zip code, but we will never identify or compare a minor's score that personally identifies a minor.
In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a minor without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that your child or a minor may have provided us personal information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Website, please contact us at compliance@splashmath.com.
After you enroll your child into one of our tutoring programs (SplashLearn Courses) and provide us with your verifiable consent in a manner set forth in our Privacy Policy , children may then share their personal information with the tutor and other students in the class during live video sessions.
Recordings of such live classes may be shared with the tutor as well as other students in the class and their parents.
If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under thirteen (13) will be accessing the Services.
You are responsible for understanding how our Services may collect and use information of users of the Services, including children.
When obtaining consent from parents or guardians, you must provide them with our Privacy Policy .
You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them.
If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district.
If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a school or school district, you will only grant access codes to teachers and staff members who are current employees of your school or district.
Upon termination of a teacher or other staff member's employment with you, you will require such individual to return and cease using all access codes he or she has in his or her possession.
If at any time you learn a user of the Services claims to be affiliated with your school or district who is not, in fact, affiliated with your school or district, you will notify us immediately.
For more information on COPPA, please see https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy.

<li>
b) Billing.
We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services.
The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms.
Currently, we use Stripe, Inc.
as our Payment Processor.
You can access Stripe’s Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal and their Privacy Policy at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.
We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor.
By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”).
You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.
We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.
</li>
<li>
c) Payment Method.
The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.
If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.
</li>
<li>
d) Recurring Billing.
As agreed to by you, some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring periods, for each of which there is a one-time charge of the same amount as made during the initial period.
By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.
WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.
SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.
TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.
</li>
<li>
e) Current Information Required.
YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT.
YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.
CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS.
IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
</li>
<li>
f) Change in Amount Authorized.
If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.
Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.
You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
</li>
<li>
g) Auto-Renewal for Paid Services.
Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your account settings, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate.
To change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings or, for mobile applications, cancel your subscription in the subscription management section of the applicable App Store.
If you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.
However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.
IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING BASIS BASED ON YOUR SELECTED PLAN.
YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICE THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS OR TERMINATE YOUR SPLASHLEARN ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM.
PAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, SPLASHLEARN WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID.
</li>
<li>
h) Reaffirmation of Authorization.
Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service.
We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.
This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.
Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.
</li>
<li>
i) Free Trials and Other Promotions.
Any trial that provides access to a Paid Service without charge must be used within the period specified for the trial.
You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of that trial period in order to avoid being charged for access to the Paid Service.
If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and believe you have been inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at help@splashlearn.com.
</li>
</ol> What if I want to stop using the Services?
You’re free to do that at any time by contacting us at help@splashlearn.com.
please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.
SplashLearn is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.
SplashLearn has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.
If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at help@splashlearn.com – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.
Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.
By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.
What about Mobile Applications and In-App Purchases?
You acknowledge and agree that the availability of our mobile application is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an “App Store”).
Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to Apple App Store set forth below.
You agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions.
To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms of Use apply.
Through our mobile applications, you may purchase (“In-App Purchase”) certain goods or features designed to enhance the performance of the Services.
When you make an In-App Purchase, you are doing so through either the Apple iTunes service or the Google Play service and you are agreeing to their respective Terms and Conditions, available at http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html and http://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html).
SplashLearn is not a party to any In-App Purchase.
I use the SplashLearn App available via the Apple App Store – should I know anything about that?
These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including our iOS applications (the “Application”) available via the Apple, Inc.
(“Apple”) App Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the Application: <ol>

What else do I need to know?
Warranty Disclaimer.
SplashLearn and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (SplashLearn and all such parties together, the “SplashLearn Parties”) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the SplashLearn Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services.
The SplashLearn Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services.
THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY SPLASHLEARN (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Limitation of Liability.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE SPLASHLEARN PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO SPLASHLEARN IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Indemnity.
To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold the SplashLearn Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.
In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).
Assignment.
You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without SplashLearn's prior written consent.
We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.
Choice of Law.
These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
Arbitration Agreement.
Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with SplashLearn and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from SplashLearn.
Both you and SplashLearn acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, SplashLearn's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.
(a) Arbitration Rules.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.
If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California.
The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.
The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) Costs of Arbitration.
The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
SplashLearn will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.
SplashLearn will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
(c) Small Claims Court.
Infringement.
Either you or SplashLearn may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
(d) Waiver of Jury Trial.
YOU AND SPLASHLEARN WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
You and SplashLearn are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
In any litigation between you and SplashLearn over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SPLASHLEARN WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor SplashLearn is entitled to arbitration.
instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.
(f) Opt-out.
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 548 Market St #64304, San Francisco, CA 94104 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.
You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.
(g) Exclusive Venue.
If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or SplashLearn to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and SplashLearn agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.
(h) Severability.
If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with SplashLearn.
Miscellaneous.
You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the SplashLearn may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.
The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
You and SplashLearn agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and SplashLearn, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of SplashLearn, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind SplashLearn in any respect whatsoever.
Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application and the arbitration agreement, you and SplashLearn agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
