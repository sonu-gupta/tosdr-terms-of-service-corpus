(“Canary”) uses cookies and other technologies on our website, mobile applications, electronic communications, advertisements, and other online services (collectively, the "Services") for a number of purposes, including: authenticating users, remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of content, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing site traffic, mobile app features and trends, and generally understanding the online and mobile behaviors and interests of people who interact with our Services.</p>
<p>Your continued use of our Services constitutes your consent to our use of these cookies and other technologies and to our use in accordance with this policy and our Privacy Policy.</p>
<small>What Are Cookies?</small>
<p>Cookies are small files containing an identifier that are stored on your browser or device.</p>
<p>There are different types of cookies.
Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies.” Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you're visiting are called “third party cookies.”</p>
<p>Canary also uses other identification technologies, such as pixel tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) which are small blocks of code on a webpage or app that allow them to read and place cookies or transmit information to us or our partners.
The resulting connection can include information such as a device's IP address, the time a person viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with the browser or device, and the type of browser being used.
Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or app to store and retrieve data on a person's computer, mobile phone or other device.
Some examples include device or HTML5 local storage and caching.</p>
