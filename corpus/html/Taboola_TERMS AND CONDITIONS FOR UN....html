In the absence of a Prepayment, Taboola will charge the credit card submitted by Advertiser via the Wizard once the Campaign spend reaches certain increments set by Taboola.
Any late payments will accrue interest equal to one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum amount allowable under law, whichever is less, compounded monthly.
If Advertiser withdraws its credit card information prior to the end of its Campaign and does not replace it with a valid alternative method of payment, Taboola reserves the right to, notwithstanding the withdrawal, charge the credit card for all Campaigns that were initiated prior to withdrawal (this includes the tail payment owed for the amount spend below the established increment).

Further, if Advertiser fails to make any payment as set forth herein, Advertiser shall pay all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Taboola in collecting such payments.
Upon the conclusion of each calendar month that the Campaign is running on the Taboola Network (each a “Campaign Month”), the Analytics Dashboard will provide Advertiser with details regarding the amount of Clicks on Advertiser’s Content and the amount of the Prepayment, if applicable, spent by Advertiser (based on the cost per click set by Advertiser in the Analytics Dashboard during the Campaign Month).
Advertiser acknowledges that any analytics provided in the Analytics Dashboard are estimates, and will only be finalized after fourteen (14) days of the Campaign Month.
For purposes of clarity, all payments shall be made in the currency designated by Taboola, unless otherwise agreed to in a separate writing between the parties.

A click will be counted each time a Visitor clicks on Advertiser Content as measured and reported in Taboola’s tracking logs (the “Click”), which are available to Advertiser anytime on the Analytics Dashboard.
(ii) Cost per Thousand Impressions (“CPM”): Advertiser pays Taboola for each Advertiser Content impression and, in the case of video Advertiser Content, once a video ad has started to play (i.e., the first frame).
An impression will be counted each time Advertiser Content is displayed on a Taboola Property (the “Impression”).
(iii) Cost per Thousand Viewable Impressions (“vCPM”): Advertiser pays Taboola only for viewable Impressions and, in the case of video Advertiser Content, a video ad is deemed viewable when at least fifty percent (50%) of its pixels appear on-screen for at least two (2) consecutive seconds.

Completion occurs when: (1) a Visitor views video Advertiser Content until the end of the video.

Any objection to any invoice shall be stated in writing to Taboola within ten (10) days of receipt of the invoice, otherwise Advertiser waives such objections and such invoice will be deemed final, not subject to dispute, and accepted by Advertiser.
Advertiser acknowledges that any analytics provided in the Analytics Dashboard or over email during the Campaign Month are estimates, and that each invoice shall reflect the final charges for each Campaign Month and the balance due.
Advertiser shall pay each invoice within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of each Campaign Month.

In addition to any other rights or remedies that Taboola may have, Advertiser’s failure to pay any invoices as set forth herein may result in Taboola cancelling or pausing Advertiser’s Campaigns.
Further, if Advertiser fails to make any payment as set forth herein, Advertiser shall pay all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Taboola in collecting such payments.
If Taboola agrees to a written request by an Advertiser to send an invoice to a third party on Advertiser’s behalf, Advertiser agrees to remain responsible and liable for payment, and if such third party does not pay the invoice within the thirty (30) day payment period, Advertiser shall immediately pay all such amounts to Taboola.</li>

In the event that&nbsp;any amount payable by Advertiser hereunder is subject to deduction or withholding for taxes, including value added taxes,&nbsp;the amount&nbsp;payable by Advertiser hereunder shall be increased such that the amount received by Taboola equals the&nbsp;amount stated on the applicable invoice.

<li>Video Bandwidth Fees: Impressions of any video Advertiser Content that is 6MB or larger, shall incur a&nbsp;“Video Bandwidth Fee”, at a rate equal to five cents per gigabyte served ($0.00005/MB).
For example, if&nbsp;1000 Impressions of an 8MB video Advertiser Content file were served hereunder, the Video Bandwidth&nbsp;Fee with respect that file would be $0.40 (i.e.
1000 Impressions * 8MB * $.00005).</li>
<li>Data Fees: Advertiser may be given the ability to target its Advertiser Content to certain audiences on the&nbsp;Taboola Network by using Taboola-provided audience data segments based on inferred&nbsp;Visitor interests or demographics (“Data Segments”).

<li>Campaign Information: Advertiser may change the Campaign Details for a particular month, a portion of a month, or on a going-forward basis at any time dashboard in the Analytics Dashboard.

For purposes of clarity, the Campaign Budget shall be in the currency designated by Taboola, unless otherwise agreed to in a separate writing between the parties.</li>
