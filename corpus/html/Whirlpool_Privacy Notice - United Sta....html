<p>You may provide your Personal Information in a variety of situations, including when you sign up for a Whirlpool account, contact us, sign up to receive communications from us, purchase a product or service, submit your product registration, submit a customer service request, enter a sweepstakes or contest entry, provide us feedback or survey responses, or otherwise use any of the Services.
Personal Information you provide may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, social media information, phone number, etc.</li>

<p>Our Apps and Smart Appliances may collect images, video, audio, or other content.
For example, a Smart Appliance might capture images of your food to recognize and automatically cook it, you might submit photos of suspected product issues so that we can help you resolve them, or you might tell us what cooking or laundry task you are performing so we can offer you customized tips.
We might also collect information from you to help us improve our products and services.</p>
2.
Usage Information.
<p>Whirlpool, our business partners, and our service providers may use technologies that collect information about how you interact with our Services, emails, advertising, and content (“Usage Information”).
Usage Information may include: (i) your device ID and IP address, which is a unique set of numbers assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
(ii) the type of browser and operating system you use.
(iii) your Smart Appliance ID, serial and part numbers, and the IP address of your home router when you connect a Smart Appliance to our network.

<p>After you connect your Smart Appliance to our network, we may automatically collect information from the Smart Appliance on a periodic basis, including status (such as whether the Smart Appliance is off or on, and details about the cycle or function it is performing), instructions that have been entered on the Smart Appliance, and aspects of its environment that may affect how it operates (such as input voltage, signal strength, and air temperature).
We may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App accesses our servers, what information has been downloaded to the App, and the instructions that are transmitted to the Smart Appliance.</p>

You may also unsubscribe from receiving promotional communications from a Whirlpool brand by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in that brand’s promotional emails.

We may retain backup copies of your information, including to assist with any legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
We will retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of processing described in this Notice.
