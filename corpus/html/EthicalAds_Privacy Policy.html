<p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p> What information EthicalAds collects and why
Information from website browsers
<p>If you're <strong>just browsing our website</strong> or just browsing a site running ads from our ad network, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect.
We use common internet technologies, such as web server logs.
We collect this basic information from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>
<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the visitor's browser type</li>
<li>language preference</li>
<li>referring site</li>
<li>the date and time of each visitor request</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use EthicalAds, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</p>
<p>We analyze potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses although we generally do not store this information.
It is used in real-time for geo-targeting advertising and fraud prevention.
Logs containing IP addresses are deleted after no more than 10 days.</p>
Information from users with accounts
<p>If you <strong>create an account</strong> as publishers who display our ads or advertisers buying ads do, we require some basic information at the time of account creation.
You will create your own password, and we will ask you for a valid email account.
You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."</p>
<p>"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her.
Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of "User Personal Information."</p>

We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p> What information EthicalAds does not collect
