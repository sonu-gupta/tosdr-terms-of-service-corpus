You’ll need to be a U.S.
resident and at least 18 years old.
If you want to use your account balance to send money to another Cash App user, then you’ll need to give us some more information about you, and we’ll need to be able to verify your identity.</p>
<p>You must be a resident of the United States, at least 18 years and the age of majority in your State of residence, and you must register for an account (your “Account) to use the Service.
Certain features of the Service will only be available for use in the United States.
Some features, such as the ability to send money to another Cash App user with the balance in your Account, may be available only if you provide us with certain information about you and we are able to verify your identity.</p>
III.
Cash App Account and Communication
1.
Cash App Account
<p> Here’s the part where you tell us you own the email or phone number you registered with and that the personal information you provide to us is correct.
You agree to cooperate with us so that we can verify your identity.
We might use third parties to help us do so.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you own the email or mobile phone number you register with and all information entered or collected in the course of creating your Account and any information you subsequently add or update from your settings (“Account Information”) is true and accurate.
All Account Information is subject to Square’s Copyright and Trademark Policy.</p>
<p>To register, open, use, or upgrade an Account, Square may require that you submit certain Account Information, including but not limited to your name, email address, text-enabled mobile phone number, street address, zip code, date of birth, social security number, and a government issued form of identification to Square.</p>
<p>When you first open your Account, it will be a “Restricted Account.” A Restricted Account has all the features and functionality described in these Terms of Service except that you cannot make a payment to another Cash App customer (including a Cash for Business Seller) using your Cash App Balance (defined below).
With a Restricted Account you may link an external, U.S.-issued bank account (an “Eligible Bank Account”) (subject to these Terms of Service) to make a payment to another Cash App customer (including payments made to a Cash for Business Seller), and you may transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to your Eligible Bank Account.
If you have a Restricted Account and you attempt to make a payment to another Cash App customer from your Cash App Balance, then you will be given the option of upgrading your Account to an “Unrestricted Account”.To upgrade your Account, you will need to provide us with certain personal information so that we can verify your identity.
After we verify your identity, your Account will convert to an Unrestricted Account.
If you decline to provide us with the information that we request or if we cannot verify your identity to our satisfaction (in our sole judgment and discretion) for any reason, then your Account will remain a Restricted Account and you will not be able to use your Cash App Balance to make payments to other Cash App users.</p>
<p>The first time you access your Account using a new device we may require you to authenticate your Account with additional information.
If your Account cannot be verified you may be required to set up a new Account.</p>
<p>You hereby authorize Square, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity or authenticate your identity and Account Information and, for Cash for Business Accounts, your company or employer.
This may include asking you for further information or documentation about your Account usage or identity, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, mobile phone number or financial instruments, or verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources.</p>
<p>In connection with your use of the Service, you may not refuse to (a) cooperate in an investigation concerning activity that potentially violates the law or the Service Terms, (b) provide confirmation of your identity, or (c) provide confirmation of any information you provide us.</p>

Error Resolution
<p> Contact us if you see any errors or issues with your account.
Our contact info is below, along with a description of the process and timeline for us to look into your issue.
We’ll need some basic information from you to begin our investigation.

We must allow you to report an error until 60 days after the date you electronically access your Account, if the error could be viewed in your electronic history.
In order for us to assess the situation, you will need to tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name and Account number;</li>
<li>Why you believe there is an error, and the dollar amount involved.
and</li>
<li>Approximately when the error took place.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.
We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.
If we need more time however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.
If we decide to do this, and your Account is registered with us, we will credit your Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.

4.
Your Liability for Unauthorized Transactions
<p> Contact us as soon as possible if you think there has been unauthorized activity on your account.
Depending on the circumstances, if an unauthorized transaction has occurred we may be able to cover you.
</p>
<p>Please let us know if you believe there is an Unauthorized Transaction on your Account.
You could lose all the money in your Account.</p>
<p>We will protect you from Unauthorized Transactions in your Account.
When this protection applies, we will cover you for the full amount of the Unauthorized Transaction, so long as we were able to complete the Error Resolution procedures described above.</p>
<p>An "Unauthorized Transaction" occurs when money is sent from your Account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.
For example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your Account, and sends a payment from your Account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.
However, the following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give someone access to your Account (e.g.
by giving them your login information) and they use your Account without your knowledge or permission, unless you have notified us that transfers by that person are no longer authorized;</li>
<li>If you, or someone else with whom you are acting in concert, act with fraudulent intent.
or</li>
<li>You reverse engineer or chargeback a transaction made with your Cash Card.</li>
</ul>
5.
Our Liability
<p> We will cover your losses for certain incomplete or incorrect transactions, detailed here.
</p>
<p>If we do not complete a transaction to or from your Account on time or in the correct amount according to these Cash Terms, we will be liable for your losses or damages.
However, there are some exceptions.
We will not be liable, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If, through no fault of ours, you have insufficient funds in your Account to complete the transaction;</li>
<li>If the ATM where you are making the Transaction or using your Cash Card does not have enough cash;</li>
<li>If the Cash App was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction;</li>
<li>If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.</li>
</ul>
6.
Funding Sources Used for Payments Made Through the Service
<p>You may link an Eligible Bank Account to your Cash App to fund payments made through the Service.
Square reserves the right to limit which banks or what types of accounts constitute an Eligible Bank Account.
If you choose to link your Eligible Bank Account to your Cash App by providing the username and password you use to access your bank information online, you acknowledge your personal and financial information is being provided to Plaid Inc., that your personal and financial information will be collected, processed, transferred, or stored in accordance with Plaid Inc.’s Privacy Policy, and that you acknowledge and agree to Plaid Inc’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When you initiate a payment through the Cash App, if you have a Restricted Account, then you will not be able to initiate payments to other Cash App users (including Sellers with Cash for Business accounts) with your Cash App Balance.
If you have a Restricted Account and you wish to make a payment to another Cash App customer, you may: (1) use an Eligible Bank Account or Eligible Credit Account.
or (2) upgrade to an Unrestricted Account to make the payment with your Cash App Balance.</p>
<p>If you have an Unrestricted Account and have sufficient funds in your Cash App Balance to satisfy the full payment amount you can choose whether you want the payment fulfilled by your Cash App Balance, Eligible Bank Account or Eligible Credit Account.
If you do not have sufficient funds in your Cash App Balance to cover the full transaction, then you may choose the funding source from your Eligible Transaction Accounts or Eligible Credit Accounts.</p>
7.
Cashtags
<p> You may choose a unique username for Cash App, which will be your “Cashtag.” If you choose a Cashtag that turns out to be too confusing or deceptive, we might require you to change it.
</p>
<p>You may select a unique alpha-numeric name to identify yourself on the Service (a “Cashtag”).
Your Cashtag must accurately and truthfully represent your business or personal identity.
You may not select a Cashtag that misleads or deceives others as to your identity or creates an undue risk of chargebacks or mistaken payments.
We may require you to change your Cashtag or details of your Account Information in our sole discretion, and we may reclaim or make unavailable Cashtags without liability to you.</p>
8.
Sharing of Your Information
<p>We will share Account Information and transaction information, including your name, the amount, and a description, with the other party to your transaction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p> Here’s where we describe your consent to receive texts from us and your representations regarding texts we send to others relating to your payments.
</p>
<p>By providing us with a mobile number, you consent to receiving text (SMS) messages from us.
If you provide us with the mobile number of any other person or entity when initiating or requesting a payment through the Service, you represent and warrant to us that the person or entity has consented to receive text messages from us related to that payment.

<p>c.
<strong>Limitations</strong>.
Square may impose limits on the amount you can keep in your Cash App Balance and reserves the right to change these limits at any time.
Funds in your Cash App Balance might not be available to use for all types of transactions.

2.
Funding Your Cash App Balance
<p> There are several ways you can add funds to your Cash App balance.
Each method is described here.
</p>
<p>a.
<strong>Eligible Bank Account</strong>.
You may use funds from your Eligible Bank Account to fund your Cash App Balance.</p>
<p>b.
<strong>Direct Deposit</strong>.
You may direct payments made to you from your employer or otherwise into your Cash App Balance using the bank routing and account number provided to you under the direct deposit program provided by our partner banks (the “Direct Deposit”).
Such Direct Deposits are governed by the terms and conditions provided by the applicable bank.</p>
<p>c.
<strong>Debit Card</strong>.
You may link a debit card to fund your Cash App Balance.
To do so, you must have a valid debit card issued by a U.S.
bank or financial institution bearing the Visa Inc.
(“Visa”), MasterCard International Inc.
(“MasterCard”), or DFS Services, LLC (“Discover”) logo.
Any such debit card, collectively with your Cash App Balance (if you have an Unrestricted Account) and an Eligible Bank Account, is referred to herein as an “Eligible Transaction Account”.</p>
<p>d.
<strong>P2P Payments Received Through Cash App</strong>.
You can keep funds received from P2P Payments (defined below) made to you through the Cash App in your Cash App Balance.</p>
<p>e.<strong>Access to Funds</strong>.Certain funding features (such as cash loads and Direct Deposit) may be unavailable or delayed from time to time due to risk-based restrictions, scheduled maintenance, changes to our Services, unforeseen circumstances, or outages.</p>
3.
Transferring Funds to Your Bank Account
<p> You can transfer funds from your Cash App balance out to your bank account.
These transfers can take up to three days, or for a fee, be made instantly.
We may limit your ability to transfer funds to your bank account, based on the circumstances.
For example, we may delay transfers while we screen for fraud or risks.
You are responsible for all amounts owed on your account even after it is closed.
</p>
<p>a.
<strong>Transfers to Your Bank Account</strong>.
You may electronically transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to an Eligible Bank Account.
By selecting an Eligible Bank Account as your deposit source you are requesting that we settle an electronic transfer to your bank account.
Square will settle these electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association (“NACHA”)) to your Eligible Bank Account in the amount you instruct, and you will not be able to cancel the ACH transfer.
Such transfer to your Eligible Bank Account via ACH will typically arrive within three (3) business days.</p>
<p>b.
<strong>Instant Deposit</strong>.
If such feature is available to you, you may transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to your Eligible Bank Account instantly via the Cash App’s instant deposit feature, which is subject to the fees detailed in the Instant Deposit experience.</p>
<p>c.
<strong>Limitations</strong>.
Square may limit how many transfers you can initiate from your Cash App to your Eligible Bank Account and the amount of funds you can transfer in a single transaction.
We reserve the right to delay or further limit such transfers while we screen for risk, or we may request you provide additional information to verify your identity.
You may not transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to your Eligible Bank Account to evade a payment investigation.
If you attempt to transfer your Cash App Balance while we are conducting an investigation, we may hold your funds at our discretion to protect Square or a third party against the risk of reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability.
We also may defer or redirect payout or restrict access to your funds as necessary to comply with applicable law, subpoena or court order, or if requested by any governmental entity.
You will remain liable for all obligations related to your Account even after the Account is closed.</p>
4.
Treatment of Funds
<p> Square will not mix your funds with Square’s corporate funds.
Your funds will be held in pooled bank accounts with the funds of other Cash App customers.
</p>
<p>If you do hold funds in your Cash App Balance, Square will hold such funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use your funds for any corporate purposes, nor will Square voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
Square will combine your funds with the funds of other users and place those pooled accounts in one or more bank accounts in Square’s name.</p>
5.
Interest
<p> You will not receive interest on the funds that you have in your stored balance.
</p>
<p>You agree that you will not receive interest on or other monies derived from the funds that Square handles and places in pooled accounts.
It is likely that Square will receive interest on funds held for its users.
In consideration for your use of the Service, and with full knowledge and understanding that Square will receive this interest, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Square all right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in pooled accounts.</p>

Description Of Service
<p>The peer-to-peer Service (“Peer-to-Peer Service”) allows you to send funds or receive funds for peer-to-peer personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>
2.
Sending Funds
<p> You will be able to send funds using our P2P service if you have a linked bank account or linked a credit card.
If you have an Unrestricted Account you will also be able to send funds using our P2P service if you have funds available in your balance.
You authorize us to move funds on your behalf.
We won’t be responsible for certain incomplete transactions, as described here.</p>
<p>Once you have opened an Account and either have funds available in an Eligible Transaction Account or linked a credit card issued by a U.S.-based bank or financial institution bearing the trademark of Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express Travel Related Payment Services Company, Inc.
(“American Express”) (an “Eligible Credit Account), you will be able to send funds using the Peer-to-Peer Service.
Note that your Cash App Balance will not be an “Eligible Transaction Account” until you have given us certain information and we have verified your identity, as set forth above.
This means that until (a) you give us this information (b) we verify your identity and (c) you have an Unrestricted Account, you will not be able to use the Cash App Balance to send funds using the Peer-to-Peer Service.
Your Cash App Balance is an “Eligible Transaction Account” only if you have an Unrestricted Account.
With a Restricted Account, you may send funds with the Peer-to-Peer Service using an Eligible Credit Account or an Eligible Bank Account.</p>
<p>As a party initiating a transfer (“Sender”), you will send funds to your selected recipient (“Recipient”) by designating the Recipient and the transfer amount to us (a “Payment Instruction”).
Your Payment Instruction authorizes us to move funds from your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account to your designated Recipient (a “P2P Payment”).
By submitting a Payment Instruction, you are also authorizing us to move funds to your applicable Eligible Transaction or applicable Eligible Credit Account for P2P Payments that are canceled or otherwise returned.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that when you initiate a P2P Payment Instruction using the Service, the processing of the Payment Instruction will begin, and funds will leave your Eligible Transaction Account, as early as the moment of the initiation of such Payment Instruction.
However, we will only begin to process the requested transfer of funds to the Recipient once the Recipient has provided all required information, and you hereby authorize and direct us to retain such funds until the earlier of such time as the Recipient has provided all required information or fourteen (14) days.</p>
<p>You agree that we shall incur no liability if we are unable to complete any transaction because of: (i) insufficient funds in your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account.
(ii) malfunction of the Peer-to-Peer Service due to circumstances beyond our control or due to circumstances that you were already aware of at the time you initiated your Payment Instruction.
(iii) inaccurate or insufficient Payment Instructions.
or (iv) failure of the Recipient to claim the P2P Payment.
or (v) either you or the Recipient does not provide us with any information that we request, or we are unable to verify your identity or the identity of the Recipient to our satisfaction.</p>
3.
Requesting Funds
<p>You may also request funds to be transferred to you through the Peer-to-Peer Service by designating the amount of funds requested and your selected Sender (a “Cash Request”).
If the Sender approves your Cash Request, your Cash Request will become the Sender’s Payment Instructions and be processed as described in these Cash Terms.</p>
4.
Receiving Funds
<p>Any P2P Payment you receive via the Peer-to-Peer Service will be stored in your Cash App Balance.</p>
5.
Peer-to-Peer Service Payment Amount Limits
<p> If you’re sending large amounts of money over the thresholds described here, you will need to provide additional ID so that we can make sure you are who you say you are.
</p>
<p>Additional identification information will be required to send more than two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) in any one transaction or in multiple transactions over any seven (7) day period or to receive more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) in any thirty (30) day period.
Senders may not send more than seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) in any one transaction or in multiple transactions over any seven (7) day period, subject to some restrictions.
We may adjust these limits at any time in our discretion.
Current limits are posted on our Support Center.</p>
6.
Peer-to-Peer Service Fees
<p> Sending money to others through our P2P service is currently free, but we can charge fees in the future.
</p>
<p>There are currently no fees for sending funds via an Eligible Transaction Account using the Peer-to-Peer Service.
The fee for sending funds using an Eligible Credit Account through Peer-to-Peer Service will be displayed at the time of the transaction.
We reserve the right to charge for or change the fees associated with use of the Peer-to-Peer Service at any time subject to these Cash Terms.</p>
7.
Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments
<p>Our ability to stop a P2P Payment Instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction will depend on how the Payment Instruction was initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction has begun processing.
P2P Payments not claimed by a Recipient for fifteen (15) days after the processing has begun will be canceled automatically.
We will attempt to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied P2P Payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account, as applicable.
If we are not able to do so, we may use other reasonable means to return the P2P Payment to you, as permitted by applicable law.</p>
8.
Invalid P2P Payments
<p> If we believe you received a payment that should not have been made for some reason (for example, fraud), you give us permission to reverse that payment.
We are not responsible for any payments that you receive, even if you don’t know who sent the payment.
</p>
<p>If you receive a P2P Payment and we later determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Payment was invalid for any reason, you hereby authorize us to move funds from the applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account in an amount equal to the P2P Payment.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable in any way for any P2P Payments that you may receive, regardless of whether you authorized the Sender to send them to you.</p>
9.
Risk of Fraudulent Transactions
<p>The Peer-to-Peer Service is a money transmission service.
As a result, fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of funds with no recourse.</p>
VI.
Cash Card
1.
Issuance of the Cash Card
<p> We may arrange for a bank to provide you with a virtual or physical Cash Card.
By using the Cash Card, you agree to any additional applicable terms from the issuing bank.
We may cancel, repossess or revoke your Cash Card at any time.
</p>
<p>Square may arrange for an issuing bank to provide you with access to a prepaid payment card under the Cash App Prepaid Card Program or a debit card under the demand deposit account program (each a “Cash Card”).
By using the Cash Card, you agree to the Cash App Prepaid Card Program Agreement or the Cash Lincoln Savings Bank Terms, as applicable (each the “Cash Card Terms”), which may be updated from time to time.
For avoidance of doubt, the applicable Cash Card Terms are between you and the issuing bank of your card program, not Square, and in the event of any inconsistency between these Cash Terms and the applicable Cash Card Terms, the applicable Cash Card Terms shall govern your use of the Cash Card and your relationship with the issuing bank.</p>
<p>The Cash Card may be issued in virtual or physical form.
To activate the virtual card, and to request a physical card, you need to follow in-app prompts.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to reject signatures and card applications for any reason.
Prohibited signatures include, but are not limited to, those signatures that depict inappropriate subject matter, the intellectual property rights of others, or an ink-intensive design.</p>
<p>Once you receive your physical card in the mail you must follow the directions in the mailing to activate your card prior to use.
Your personal identification number (“PIN”) will be the code you set as your Cash PIN, and you may reset the PIN in the Cash App.
Your physical card may be cancelled, repossessed, or revoked at any time without prior notice at our discretion (including for depicting a prohibited signature) subject to applicable law.</p>
2.
Using the Cash Card
<p> You can use your Cash Card to make purchases using any available Cash App balance.
You agree we can move funds from your balance to your Cash Card for purchases that you make with your Cash Card.
</p>
<p>Your Cash Card may be used to make purchases with a merchant using any available amounts in your Cash App Balance.

3.
Payment Transaction Limits
<p> You agree that you won’t make a purchase or transaction in excess of the funds available in your balance and if you do, you agree that we can recover any negative balance.
</p>
<p>You can only make transactions using your Cash Card to the extent that you have funds in your Cash App Balance to support those transactions.
You agree not to make a purchase or other transaction in excess of the funds available in your Cash App Balance.
If you do make a purchase or other transaction that exceeds the funds available in your Cash App Balance, you agree that we can recover any negative balance incurred.</p>
4.
No Right to Stop Payment
<p>You do not have the right to stop payment on a transaction originated with your Cash Card.</p>
5.
“Disable Card” Feature
<p> You may use the “Disable Card” feature of Cash App to disable your Cash Card if you lose your Cash Card or think it has been stolen.
</p>
<p>In the event of a lost, stolen, or misplaced Cash Card, or you otherwise want to prevent future transactions from your Cash Card, you may disable your Cash Card with the Cash App’s “Disable Card” feature within the Cash App.
Use of this feature will not prevent processing of pending transactions initiated prior to disabling your Cash Card.
In the event you have found your card, or otherwise want to enable a disabled Cash Card, you must select the “Enable Card” option within the Cash App before your “disabled” Cash Card can be used for transactions.
You are responsible for preventing unauthorized disabling and enabling activity on your device relating to your Cash Card.
Such activity, when not authorized, may be deemed invalid in Square’s sole discretion.</p>
6.
Card Cancellation
<p> If we determine that you are no longer eligible for a Cash Card, we will let the issuing bank know and your Cash Card may be canceled without notice.
</p>
<p>We will inform the issuing bank if we determine that you are no longer eligible for your Cash Card.
If you are no longer eligible for your Cash Card it may be canceled at any time without notice as detailed in the applicable Cash Card Terms and your funds will be returned to you unless they are the subject of an investigation into suspected unlawful activity, or if Square is otherwise required by law to withhold your funds.</p>

Cash for Business
1.
Transaction Processing for Sellers of Goods or Services
<p> If you are a seller of goods or services, we will process your transactions as an agent on your behalf.
We will charge you a fee, depositing the balance of payments from your customers into your Cash App balance.
You allow us to void transactions if we believe that a chargeback for the transactions will occur.
</p>
<p>If your are a seller of goods or services you will be badged with an official insignia or otherwise designated as having a “Cash for Business” account.
In doing so, you are creating a Square Account (as that term is defined in the General Terms) with us and you accept and agree to the Payment Terms.
We may use certain information from your Account Information to create your Square Account and display such information to your customers, such as on receipts.
In connection with the Payment Services (as defined in the Payment Terms), you authorize us to act as your agent for the purposes of holding, receiving, and disbursing funds on your behalf.
Once you have created an Account you will be able to accept payments from Cash App users for the sale of goods and services.
We will, acting on your behalf, facilitate the processing of such payment transactions.
We will charge you a fee for doing so.
Payments from your customers, less our fee, will be deposited to your Cash App Balance.
You acknowledge and agree that you may not have all features and functionality of a standard Square Account.
To protect the integrity of the system and reduce risk that a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Square Account (a “Chargeback”), in some cases where we reasonably believe a Chargeback is likely, you also direct and authorize us, as your agent, to void the transaction, rather than hold funds as described in the Payment Terms.</p>
2.
Purchases from Cash for Business Sellers
<p> You may use your account or a linked card to purchase goods and services from Cash for Business sellers.
By initiating a payment to a Cash for Business seller, you agree to let that seller debit your account or linked card to complete the transaction.
You can use your Cash App Balance to purchase goods and services from Cash for Business sellers only after we have verified your identity.
</p>
<p>As a Cash App customer, you may purchase goods and services from Cash for Business Sellers or to make donations to charities or political campaigns who use Cash for Business.
Note that you can fund these purchases from your Cash App Balance only if we have verified your identity as described above.
If we have not yet verified your identity, then you will not be able to use your Cash App Balance to purchase goods or services from Cash for Business Sellers or to make donations to charities or political campaigns who use Cash for Business.
You may only use other authorized linked accounts for such transactions.</p>
<p>Typically Cash for Business Sellers will be identified to you by a badge in the Cash App.
By initiating a payment transaction to a Cash for Business Seller, you authorize the Cash for Business Seller to charge your applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account to complete the purchase or donation and you consent to sharing information from your Account with the Cash for Business Seller.
In the event you are entitled to a reversal, refund, chargeback, or other adjustment associated with any purchase you made through Cash for Business, you also authorize a credit to the applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account to accomplish that transaction.
Purchases from Cash for Business Sellers using your Eligible Credit Account or Eligible Bank Account will be processed by Square as agent for Cash for Business Sellers in accordance with these Cash Terms.</p>

<strong>Mobile Check Capture Terms of Service</strong>
<p>
<strong>Dated: May 13, 2020</strong>
</p>
<p>This page explains our terms for Mobile Check Capture.
By using the service you agree to these terms.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>These Mobile Check Capture Terms of Service (the “Mobile Check Capture Terms”) govern your use of
Mobile Check Capture which enables you to use Cash App, a payment service and financial platform offered by Square, Inc.
(“Square,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) and certain hardware (such as a smartphone or other mobile device) approved by us to create electronic images of the front and back of certain eligible paper checks and to transmit those images and other information, including, without limitation, information captured from the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line for review, processing and loading into your Cash App Balance (as defined in the Additional Virtual Currency Terms of Service).</p>
I.
General Information
<p> This section defines what an Electronic Check is and details what data we collect from the Electronic Check.
It also informs you that we may decline to process your check or reverse our decision to process your check.
To protect yourself, you should retain your paper check for two weeks.
You agree not to use this feature to disrupt Cash App or to conduct illegal activity.
</p>
1.
“Electronic Check” means the electronic image of, and electronic information derived from, a paper check, as well as any associated data (including information you provide us or that Cash App collects in connection with the submission of the check image).
<ol>
<li>
<p>When you submit an Electronic Check, Cash App may capture and retain various information from the mobile device, including time and geolocation data.
To use Mobile Check Capture, you must have provided Cash App with all hardware and operating permissions that it requests, including permission to access your device’s camera, files stored on your device, device time, and geolocation information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After we receive your transmission, we will review each Electronic Check.
We may decline to accept an Electronic Check in our sole discretion, even if the Electronic Check meets the eligibility standards and your Cash App account is in good standing.
You should not assume that any check will be accepted for Mobile Check Capture.
If you will need to cash a check immediately, then you should have backup check cashing options for situations where Mobile Check Capture does not accept your check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After we have accepted an Electronic Check from you, you must keep the original check in a secure location for two weeks.
It is imperative that you do so, because we reserve the right to reverse our decision to accept an Electronic Check.
If we do, we will notify you of our decision, and you may cash or deposit the check through another service or at a different institution.
After two weeks, you must either destroy the original check or clearly and indelibly mark it as VOID, unless we have contacted you with other instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not use Mobile Check Capture to (i) interfere with or disrupt the operation of Cash App or Mobile Check Capture.

and</li>
<li>The check has not been dishonored previously, nor are you aware of any reason to believe that the check will be dishonored (e.g., you have been told that the maker of the check does not have enough money in the account to cover the check).</li>
</ol>
III.
Representations and Warranties
<p> Here is the part where you tell us all the information on the check you are transmitting through Mobile Check Capture is true and that the check is eligible for this service.

We may need to contact you about your check.
Please update your contact information on Cash App.
</p>
1.
After you submit an Electronic Check with Mobile Check Capture, wait until the app confirms successful submission.
Then, place the original paper check in a secure location.
Keep the original check for two weeks, and then destroy it, unless we instruct you otherwise.
<ol>
<li>It is critical that we be able to contact you after you submit an Electronic Check with Mobile Check Capture.

Be sure to check your email and text messages for the email address and phone number we will use to contact you.</li>
</ol>
V.
Dishonored Electronic Checks
<p>If any Electronic Check is dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason, then we may immediately (and without further notice to you) deduct any funds from the Electronic Check that we have credited to your Cash App Balance.
If we have already made funds from the Electronic Check available to you then this deduction may result in a negative Cash App Balance.
We may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Virtual Currency Terms of Service "Recovery of Funds" to bring your negative balance to zero.</p>
VI.
Claims by Drawee Bank
<p> The bank that accepts your check from us may have a claim against us if there are problems with your check.
Some common problems, but not all, are listed here.
If we make the bank that accepts your check whole, then we may recover funds from you.
</p>
Pursuant to applicable law and the rules of the check collection system, the drawee bank or a collecting bank might pursue a warranty claim or other claim against us related to the Electronic Check, even after the check was honored and paid in full.
Common grounds for claims like this include:
<ol>
<li>The original check, or another electronic check created from the original check, was presented for payment, either before or after the drawee bank paid the Electronic Check;</li>
<li>The maker’s signature or any indorsement was forged, or the check was otherwise issued fraudulent and without the authorization of a person authorized to write checks on the account;</li>
<li>The check was altered after it was made.
and</li>
<li>The information in the Electronic Check images did not match the information that you provided at the time that you submitted the Electronic Check, or it was not possible to verify that information because the information in the Electronic Check images was illegible.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of the reasons that the drawee bank or a collecting bank may assert a claim with respect to the Electronic Check to recover amounts paid.
If we (or one of our banks or other service providers) are subject to such a claim, then we may immediately recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds (and without notice to you).</p>
VII.
Funds Availability
1.
Your Ability to Withdraw or Use Funds from an Electronic Check
<p> We may delay your access to funds while we process your check.
</p>
Our policy is to delay the availability of funds from Electronic Checks that you Successfully Submit (as defined below) with Mobile Check Capture.
During the delay, you may not use the funds for transactions, including transactions to: (i) make a payment to another Cash App customer (including a Cash for Business Seller).
(ii) withdraw cash using your Cash Card.
(iii) make a purchase with your Cash Card.
(iv) fund a transfer to your Eligible Bank Account.
(v) initiate a “Buy” transaction for virtual currency.
or (vi) fund an order to purchase securities using your Cash App Investing Account.
<p>An Electronic Check is considered “Successfully Submitted” when you have received confirmation within the Cash App that the Electronic Check has been submitted and accepted by us.</p>
2.
When Funds From an Electronic Check Generally Will be Available
<p> This is where we tell you the cut off time for a check to be submitted in order to be counted on a specific day and potential hold periods.</p>
The length of the delay is counted in business days from the day that you Successfully Submit the Electronic Check.
Every day is a business day except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.
If you Successfully Submit an Electronic Check before 7:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on a business day, we will consider the Electronic Check to have been Successfully Submitted on that day.
However, if you Successfully Submit an Electronic Check after 7:00 pm Eastern Time or on a day that is not a business day, we will consider that the Electronic Check was Successfully Submitted on the next business day.
Funds from a U.S.
Treasury check will generally be available the first business day after you Successfully Submit the Electronic Check with Mobile Check Capture, unless such deposit is subject to a hold as otherwise provided in this agreement.
<p>Checks other than U.S.
Treasury checks are subject to a hold period between 1 and 15 business days.</p>
3.
Checks Returned or Subject to a Refund Claim
<p> We may make funds available to you before they clear from the paying bank.
If we do, and the funds do not clear the paying bank you will be required to pay back the funds we made available to you.
If you present us with a check that has been paid out by another bank and we also make funds available to you, you will be required to repay the funds to us.</p>
In many cases, funds from an Electronic Check will be made available to you sooner than the Electronic Check can be collected from the paying bank.
This means that an Electronic Check that you Successfully Submit with Mobile Check Capture could be returned unpaid after funds have been made available to you.
If an Electronic Check is returned unpaid, we may immediately reverse the amount credited to your Cash App Balance for the Electronic Check.
If this results in a negative balance, then you will be required to repay us this negative balance immediately.
We may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds to bring your negative balance to zero.
<p>If an Electronic Check is presented for payment more than once, the paying bank may recover funds paid on the Electronic Check.
If this happens, we may deduct the amount of the Electronic Check from your Cash App Balance immediately.
If this results in a negative balance, you will be required to repay the negative balance immediately, and we may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds to bring your negative balance to zero.</p>
