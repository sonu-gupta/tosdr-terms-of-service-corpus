         Our Privacy Policy <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us.
This policy explains what personal information we have, how we use it and how you can check and update any of your personal information.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, when we refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>“you”, we mean the person/s who use, contract for, or show interest in O2 products and services or events, their representatives and any third parties connected to you that you’ve told us about;</li>
<li>“we” or “us”, we mean Telefonica UK Limited (“O2”);</li>
<li>“VMED O2 UK Limited”, we mean the joint venture company&nbsp;with registered number 12580944 and whose registered address is Griffin House, 161 Hammersmith Road, London, UK W6 8BS.
The joint venture company owns O2 and Virgin Media (which means the companies that provide Virgin Media products and services including Virgin Media Limited, Virgin Mobile Telecoms Limited, Virgin Media Mobile Finance Limited, Virgin Media Business Limited and Virgin Media Wholesale Limited).</li>
</ul>
<p>VMED O2 UK Limited owns O2 and Virgin Media which means that together these businesses, their parent, affiliate and subsidiary companies, are now all part of a joint venture (the “Joint Venture Group”) that can offer you more products, services and benefits.
To enable us to integrate our business and work together and so that we can manage our relationship with you we may share your data between the other members of the Joint Venture Group.</p>
O2 and Virgin Media are each still separate Controllers however.
So, if you have any questions or wish to exercise any of your rights in relation to the data we process you can continue to get in touch with us using the contact information set out in this Privacy Policy.
And for information on Virgin Media products and services and how Virgin Media use your information please visit https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/the-legal-stuff/privacy-policy.
<p>&nbsp;</p> Why do we collect your personal information?&nbsp.
<p>We collect information because:</p>
<p>
<strong>You’ve contracted with us.</strong> For example, we need your information to help manage your account and deliver products and services relevant to you (whether we provide them or not), or you work for O2 and we need your information to look after you and your employment with us;</p>
<p>
<strong>You’ve given us your consent</strong>.
For example, if you’ve entered a competition, or agreed for us, or specified third parties, to send you direct marketing, offers and perks that are relevant to you;</p>
<p>
<strong>We’ve got a legitimate interest</strong> to help us run and grow our business.
For example, improving our products and services, developing new ones, telling you or prospective customers about our products and services (unless it’s in a way that requires consent), finding new customers, understanding more about who our customers are and what they like, tailoring our advertising to the right audience/s managing credit and fraud risks, managing our network and complying with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>
<strong>The law also requires us to process some information</strong>.
For example, we need to monitor usage to make sure we implement spend caps correctly.
Occasionally this information is anonymised so you can't be identified.</p>

<ul>
<li>The type of Information we have.</li>
<li>Where do we get your information?</li>
<li>How we use your information.</li>
<li>How we share your information.</li>
<li>Why we keep hold of your information.</li>
<li>How to check and update your information.</li>
<li>Product specific terms.</li>
<li>Other important things to know.</li>
</ul> The type of information we have <p>The information we have about you includes things like who you are, how you use your O2 products and services, where you use our network, and how you pay for your services.</p>
<p>Who you are&nbsp;includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name, phone number,&nbsp;address, gender, age, interests, etc.</li>
<li>Your debit or credit card details, bank details and other payment information.</li>
<li>Your interests and preferences.</li>
<li>Your driving license or other documents that help us verify your identity or contact details or your authority to represent an O2 customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>How you use your O2 products and services includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your call, text, surfing and billing records.</li>
<li>Details about your usage of any other products we supply to you, such as our apps.
This includes the date and time you use them, how long for, where you use them and how much it costs.</li>
<li>We don't look at the content of your messages or listen to your calls (unless you are talking to one of our customer service advisors).</li>
</ul>
<p>Where you use our network:</p>
<p>So we can connect you to our network, and for some of the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy, we need to know your location when you make or receive phone calls, messages or use the internet.
We call this network location.
It works by finding you through nearby phone masts, providing us with a rough location so we can put calls through or connect you to the internet.</p>
<p>If you don't want us to share your network location or some or all of your services, call us on 1300.
It's free from your O2 mobile.</p>
<p>Your smartphone might also have a Global Positioning System (GPS) location, that's used by your phone and certain apps.
It's more accurate than network location alone, because it uses satellites.
If you're using some of our apps, like Priority&nbsp;we, or our partners, might collect some of your GPS location information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GPS location is different from network location.
We don't control it, so there's no need to call 1300.
GPS is based on satellites and is set up on the phone itself.
Look at your phone's settings to configure it.
Remember, if you choose not to share your location, you might not be able to use certain services that need to know where you are for those services to work.</p>
<p>What you do with your O2 account(s):</p>
<p>This includes things such as when and how much you top up and pay your bill, or how often and why you access your account with us.</p> Where do we get your information? <p>We collect information mainly when you sign up with us, contact us and when you use our products and services.
We also record calls for training and monitoring purposes.</p>
<p>For example, we will collect information&nbsp;when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You register as a customer or enquire about O2 products, services or events&nbsp;or take part in market research.</li>

<li>You submit content, including photographs, or comments to participate in discussion threads.</li>
<li>You use any of our networks – mobile, wifi or other O2 products and services.</li>

If you purchase tickets through Priority,&nbsp;use third party services which need to verify your mobile number or identity, or if&nbsp;you have purchased general sale tickets through a third party but have specifically consented to&nbsp;receive communications from us, we will receive your information from that third party.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take part in market research for us we will also collect information from third party website or social media you access from our sites, in accordance with the privacy policies of those respective websites and social media.</p> How we use your information <p>We use and analyse your information to keep in touch with you and to supply and improve our products and services.
We will also use your information to tell you about products and services that we think may interest you.
&nbsp;Sometimes we'll combine and anonymise this information so you won't be identified.&nbsp;You must obtain consent from any third parties whose personal or sensitive information you provide to us in your application for and / or performance of O2 products and services, (like O2’s insurance products), for us to receive and process that information for those purposes.</p>

&nbsp;We only provide the information needed for these third parties to perform their services, and they’re only allowed to use it for the purpose that we’ve agreed with them and under the contracts we have put in place with them.</p>
<p>This might mean sharing that&nbsp;information with:</p>
