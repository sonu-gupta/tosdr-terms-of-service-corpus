Data retention and deletion<p>
<strong>Retention</strong>
</p>
<p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Anchor Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>maintaining the performance of the Anchor Service</li>
<li>making data-driven business decisions about new features and offering</li>
<li>complying with our legal obligations</li>
<li>resolving disputes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Deletion</strong>
</p>
<p>If you close or request that we close your account, we’ll delete or anonymise your personal data so it no longer identifies you, unless we’re required to keep something or we still need to use it for a legally justifiable reason.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of situations where we’re legally allowed or required to keep some of your personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there’s an unresolved issue relation to your account, such as an outstanding credit or unresolved claim or dispute</li>
<li>for our legal, tax, audit and accounting obligations</li>
<li>for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain security</li>
</ul>7.
Transfer to other countries<p>When carrying out the activities described in this Policy, Spotify shares your personal data internationally with other Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners.
They may process your personal data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live.
For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law</li>
<li>help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU</li>
</ul>
<p>We do this using a variety of protections, as appropriate for each data transfer.
For example, we use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Contractual Clauses (or an alternative legal tool) to require the third party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections</li>
<li>technical portections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation</li>
<li>policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests</li>
</ul>
<p>You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal data.</p>8.
Keeping your personal data safe<p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.
We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.
However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.</p>
<p>We have implemented various safeguards including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.</p>
<p>To protect your user account, we encourage you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a strong password that is unique to your Anchor account</li>
<li>never share your password with anyone</li>
<li>limit access to your computer or browser</li>
<li>log out once you have finished using the Anchor Service on a shared device</li>
</ul>9.
Children<p>The Anchor Service has a minimum “Age Limit” in each country.
The Anchor Service is not directed to children whose age:</p>
<ul>
<li>is under the age or 13 years</li>
<li>or, makes it illegal to process their personal data</li>
<li>or, requires parental consent to process their personal data</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit.
If you’re under the Age Limit, please do not use the Anchor Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.</p>
<p>If you’re a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify via the Anchor Service, please contact us.</p>
<p>If we learn that we’ve collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we’ll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.
This may require us to delete the Anchor account for that child.</p>10.
Changes to this Policy<p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.</p>
<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances.
For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Anchor Service or send you an email or device notification.</p>11.
