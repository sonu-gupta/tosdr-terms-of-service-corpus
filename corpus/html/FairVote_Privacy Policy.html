<p>Your privacy is important to us.
To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>
Donor Privacy
<p>Donor privacy is important to us.
FairVote will not trade, share, or sell a donor's personal information with anyone else, nor send donor mailings on behalf of other organizations.
We may occasionally have third party vendors perform services on our behalf to&nbsp;improve our ability to pursue our mission.
These third parties have access to your personal information only as needed to perform their services for FairVote and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the personal information.
We may agree to allow a third party vendor to take aggregated and anonymized data about activity on the FairVote site and donations to FairVote, and use that data for other purposes such as improvement of the vendor’s products or benchmarking for the vendor’s other clients.&nbsp.
In each instance, the third party vendor will be contractually obligated to ensure the data won’t be recombined with other information to create any record about you as an identifiable individual.</p>
