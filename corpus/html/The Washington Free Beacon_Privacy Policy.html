<em>Do-Not-Track Signals</em>.
Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals.
However, web browsers incorporate and activate this feature differently, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted or are aware of them.
Because these browser features are not uniform, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.</p>
