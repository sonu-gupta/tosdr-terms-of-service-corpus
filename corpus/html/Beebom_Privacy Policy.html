However, we only recommend relevant products that have high ratings&nbsp;and positive reviews.</p>
<p>Starting September 2015, Beebom has started using VigLink’s&nbsp;affiliate program which converts external links to affiliate links.
Whenever a user makes purchase using such link, we earn a small compensation.
However, very much like the case of Amazon associates, we only recommend relevant and useful products for readers.
