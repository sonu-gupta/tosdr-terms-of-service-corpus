DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

You may bring claims only on your own behalf.

This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration.
In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
