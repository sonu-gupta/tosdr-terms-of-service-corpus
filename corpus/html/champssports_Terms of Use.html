<strong>Binding Arbitration Process and Procedure</strong>
<ul>
<li>If we cannot resolve a Dispute informally, any Dispute will be resolved only by binding, bilateral arbitration before one or more neutral arbitrators in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.
You understand that by this Arbitration Agreement, you are giving up the right to a jury trial and to have your dispute resolved in court.</li>
<li>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Arbitration Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope, applicability, or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by arbitration.</li>
<li>Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration shall be conducted via telephone, videoconference, or within the county in which you reside.
You have the right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Any arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual basis.
class arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are not permitted.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.&nbsp.
An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.</li>
<li>You and we agree that each party will provide written notice to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to initiating an arbitration or small claims court proceeding, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally.
Notice to us shall be sent to us (or any of us) by certified mail or courier to:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Foot Locker, Inc.<br>330 West 34<sup>th</sup> Street<br>New York, New York 10001<br>Attention: General Counsel</p>

Our notice to you will be sent electronically and/or to the most-recent address we have in our records for you.
it is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.&nbsp.
If you and us cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or us may, as appropriate and in accordance with these Terms, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for above, file a claim in court.</p>
<ul>
<li>The arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
(“JAMS”) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and, where applicable, the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards for consumers.
The JAMS rule are available at jamsadr.com.&nbsp.
Unless the parties otherwise agree, the arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator.
Both you and we shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the process of choosing the arbitrator.&nbsp.
All arbitrators shall serve as neutral, independent and impartial arbitrators.
The cost of arbitration shall be borne by the parties in accordance with the applicable JAMS Rules.&nbsp.
With the exception of the portion of the JAMS fee to initiate a claim required to be paid by consumers that initiate an arbitration (currently $250 and designed to be approximately equivalent to current Court filing fees), and any counsel that you elect to retain, you will not be responsible for any costs associated with the JAMS proceeding.&nbsp.
If you elect to be represented by counsel, you are responsible for any costs and fees associated with that counsel.
&nbsp;To the extent permitted by law, an arbitrator may award costs and/or fees if the arbitrator finds the party’s claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be frivolous or asserted or conducted for an improper purpose.
<ul>
<li>The parties are entitled to seek recovery of costs and attorney’s fees to the same extent they would be entitled to seek such recovery for the same claim in court under controlling law.
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law.</li>

If, however, the Class Action Waiver set forth in section 20.2 hereof is deemed void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety.</li>
