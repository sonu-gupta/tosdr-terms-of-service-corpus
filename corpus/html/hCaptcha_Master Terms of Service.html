<p>
<em>Last Updated: August 16, 2020</em>
</p>
<p>Welcome to hCaptcha! Thank you for being a part of our community.
All users of the "Services" (defined below) must agree to the following terms (the "Terms of Service").
Under these Terms of Service, "IMI", "we" and "us" refers to Intuition Machines, Inc.
and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, representatives, and agents, and our "website" includes any website under our control, including www.hcaptcha.com and www.imachines.com.</p>
<p>Please read these Terms of Service&nbsp;CAREFULLY.
They include, among other provisions, disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liability, and binding arbitration.
Please note that these Terms of Service may have changed since your last visit to our website.
We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our<br>sole discretion.
In the event of a material change, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms of Service on this page, after which you must affirmatively accept the updated Terms of Service in order to continue using or accessing the Site or the Service.</p>
<p>Please note that your use of our Service is governed by our Data Processing Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Please review this agreement to see how we process personal data on your behalf.
Note that we operate as a "data processor" for purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and a "service provider" for the purpose of the California Consumer Privacy Act.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you may not use or access the Site or the Service.<br>‍<br>1.
Purpose<br>The Services include an online security service (the "hCaptcha Service")&nbsp;and a platform (the "Intuition Machines Platform") on which an individual ("Contributor") can choose to perform tasks that a third party entity or Intuition Machines itself (each a "Requester") posts to our website or the hCaptcha Service, either directly on our website or by accessing the Intuition Machines Platform and/or performing tasks through or in connection with a third party entity and/or platform or service (each, an "Integrator").
Requesters post tasks and invite Contributors to perform them in exchange for rewards provided by IMI to Integrators, or as determined by the Requester if the Requester is using the Intuition Machines Platform or hCaptcha Service to serve tasks to their own end-users.
We charge companies and individuals (each a "Customer") for use of our platform so that they may use our software, author tasks, hire us to author tasks, and/or gain access to the Contributors.
We also charge Integrators for use of our hCaptcha Service in order to reduce fraud, abuse, and spam on their websites, mobile apps, and other online properties.
The foregoing is referred to collectively as the "Services."<br>
<br>2.
Eligibility<br>By using or registering for our Services, you agree: you are at least 18 years of age.
you have the authority to enter this agreement on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent, and will at all times remain in compliance with these Terms of Service and all IMI policies and guidelines referenced herein.
and you will not abuse our website, misrepresent your identity to us, or use artificial intelligence to complete any portion of any task on IMI which requires human intelligence.<br>‍<br>3.
Customers and Requesters<br>If you are a Customer or Requester, you agree that the additional terms attached hereto as the Customer Appendix will apply and be incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.
If you are not a Customer or Requester, or cease to be a Customer or Requester, then the additional terms in the Customer Appendix will not apply nor will they be incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.
<br>
<br>4.
Username and Password<br>Upon registration, you will be asked to disclose certain personal information about you ("Personal Information"), including your name, email address, and to create a username and password, all of which will be subject to our Privacy Policy, available on our website.

<br>

Your Privacy, Your Data, and "Data For All"<br>You accept our Privacy Policy, which governs what we will do with any Personal Information you give to us.
<br>
<br>In addition to Personal Information, you may also be required to provide (or it may be necessary for us to collect) other data so that we may provide the Services (collectively, "Customer Data").
We are not liable for any failure to perform Services that is caused by your delay or failure to provide Customer Data.<br>
<br>You hereby grant to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license during the term of this Agreement to use, reproduce, electronically distribute, and publicly display any Customer Data solely for the purpose of providing the Services.
You represent and warrant that you own sufficient right, title, and interest in and to your data in order to grant the license in this section.
<br>
<br>We aggregate Customer Data with other data so that results are non-personally identifiable and we also collect de-identified technical logs and data regarding use of the Services ("Aggregate/De-identified Data").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any such Aggregate/De-identified Data may be used by IMI for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement, including without limitation to develop and improve the Services and to create and distribute reports and other materials.
Customer Data may also persist and be displayed in the system for a limited period of time not to exceed 180 days after a job is complete, for example as automatic calibration or validation data for Intuition Machines systems.
For clarity, this Section 5 does not give us the right to identify you as the source of any Aggregate/De-identified Data without your prior written permission.<br>
<br>If you have selected the "Data For All" option as part of your use of the Services, then you grant to IMI and all users of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license to fully exploit all Customer Data, including all related intellectual property rights.
If you do select the "Data for All" option, you represent and warrant that you own sufficient right, title, and interest in and to your data in order to grant the license in this section.<br>

<br>Alternative Dispute Resolution Required.
You agree that for any dispute that arises out of or relates to your use of the Services, including any dispute that may have arisen from the time that you began performing tasks for IMI, and specifically including any claim related to whether or not you classify as an independent contractor, you will first notify IMI of your claim against it.
You and IMI will then attempt to resolve the issue through either direct negotiation or mediation.
We will split equally the cost of mediation and agree that mediation shall be conducted through telephonic or other electronic means.
If a claim remains unresolved following informal negotiations or mediation, you agree that you and IMI will use final and binding arbitration to resolve the dispute.

All arbitration under this agreement will be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association or by a mutually agreed upon arbitration service.
The arbitrator will be a U.S.
arbitrator selected from a list of no less than seven (7) names through alternative strikes.
In arbitration, each party will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the arbitrator.
Resolution of the dispute shall be based solely upon the law governing the claims and defenses pleaded, and the arbitrator may not invoke any basis other than such controlling law.
The arbitrator shall have the immunity of a judicial officer from civil liability when acting in the capacity of an arbitrator, which immunity supplements any other existing immunity.
Awards must include the arbitrator's written reasoned opinion.
You give up your right to trial by jury of any claim you may have against IMI or that IMI may have against you.

Department of Labor, and the National Labor Relations Board.
Nothing in this clause shall be deemed to preclude or excuse you from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill your obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration, however, you waive the right to any monetary award through this such agency proceedings.<br>

</p>Business Continuity Planning Statement<br>
<p>Intuition Machines, Inc has developed a Business Continuity Plan on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our hCaptcha business.
Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur.
With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.<br>
<br>‍<strong>Contacting Us</strong> – If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at support@hcaptcha.com, you should go to our website at hcaptcha.com or imachines.com, or hcaptchastatus.com.<br>
<br>‍<strong>Our Business Continuity Plan</strong> – We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers and their end users to transact online.
In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business continuity plan addresses: data backup and recovery.
all mission critical systems.
financial and operational assessments.
alternative communications with customers, employees, and oversight bodies.
alternate physical location of employees.
critical supplier and customer impact.
regulatory reporting.
and giving our customers prompt notice if we are unable to continue our business.&nbsp;Our core supplier pool backs up our important records in a geographically separate area.
While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by this supplier pool that their objective is to restore their own operations and be able to resume services rapidly.
Although we have worked to reduce risk by using a diverse set of suppliers, your services could be modified or interrupted during this period.<br>
<strong>
<br>Varying Disruptions </strong>– Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the neighborhood where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region.
Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe.
In a disruption to our firm, our business district, city, or region or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect no material disruption to business operations.
In either situation, we plan to continue in business, transfer operations to alternative suppliers if necessary, and notify you through our website at hcaptcha.com and our status page at hcaptchastatus.com as to how to contact us.
If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will notify you expeditiously.<br>‍<br>
