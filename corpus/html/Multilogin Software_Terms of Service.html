<p>5.9 As not all legal persons are liable to a VAT identification number, we use the VAT identification number search of the Estonian Tax and Customs Board to determine if the domestic user has an Estonian VAT identification number or if the user is from another EU country, we use the European Commission VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) to determine if the user has a valid VAT number in its place of establishment.</p>
<p>5.10 More information on pricing and VAT is available at https://multilogin.com/pricing-purchase/, COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2006/112/EC, Value-Added Tax Act or contact customer support at support@multilogin.com for details.</p>
<p>We may change pricing plan descriptions at any time without notice.</p>
<p>The prices of services may change from time to time.</p>
<p>Existing customers will be able to use the remaining time of their subscribed service till the end of that particular subscription billing cycle.</p>
<p>VAT is usually not charged to users from countries outside the European Union.
But VAT may be charged and due in the country of residence of the particular user.</p>
<p>For users subscribing within the EU, VAT may be added to the price.
As a general rule, VAT is chargeable on most sales and purchases of goods within the EU.</p>
<p>Usually VAT is charged in the country where the user belongs to.
For a natural person it is the place where the person has a permanent address or usually resides.
For a VAT liable legal person, it is the country where the business is established or has fixed premises.</p>
<p>VAT depends on the country of residence, e.g.
a natural person lives in Sweden and subscribes to our Service.
We must charge Swedish VAT 25% and not Estonian VAT 20%.
But if a VAT liable legal person established in Sweden subscribes to our Service, we charge 0% VAT as it is an intra-EU supply of the Service between VAT liables.</p>
<p>If a natural person lives in Finland, but subscribes for our Service while only on holiday in the south of France, 24% VAT for Finland is charged.</p> 6 SECTION – CREATING A SITE ACCOUNT AND LOGIN
