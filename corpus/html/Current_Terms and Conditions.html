<li> Service Description.
&nbsp;The “Service” consists of Current’s website located at https://currentmusic.us (the “Website”), Current’s mobile applications (each an “App” and, collectively, the “Apps”), and all other online properties provided by Current or any of its affiliates, as each may be updated, relocated, or otherwise modified from time to time, including through networks, embeddable widgets, downloadable software, and mobile device applications, and all intellectual property contained therein.
&nbsp;The Service presently enables or in the future may enable Users (as defined in Section&nbsp;2.1) to access audio only, audio visual and literary content, including when any of the foregoing are made available through Third Party Services (as defined in Section&nbsp;15) (collectively, “Content”) via streaming for real-time listening and via the use of a record feature provided for personal, time-shifted future listening.
&nbsp;The Service may provide an information location tool and presently provides an audio guide service offering access to a selection of indexed radio stations, podcasts, and other streaming content from Third Party Services who are solely responsible for the content included in their transmissions.
&nbsp;The Service may include a functionality that permits Users to obtain Products (as defined in Section&nbsp;5.3) solely for redemption on the Service via the use of Current Credits (as defined in Section&nbsp;5.1) for the time, attention, and data arising from, during and between User’s consumption of Content (e.g., the viewing of or listening to Content).
&nbsp;The Service may also permit Users to record, save, and share certain Content, including by linking the User’s Account (as defined in Section 2.1) to accounts on third-party platforms.
&nbsp;To the extent a functionality described herein is not presently provided by Current, any Terms specifically governing such functionality will not apply until such functionality is made available to you.
&nbsp;Nothing in this Service Description guarantees that any functionalities described herein will be made available by Current at any time or in all territories where the Service is available, and Current reserves the right to not implement or terminate any implementation of any functionality at any time for any and all users and in all or some territories without notice and without any liability to you.
&nbsp;But we aim to offer you some great functionalities so please visit the Service often to see what new and exciting things we provide.
</li>
<li> Changes to these Terms.
&nbsp;You understand and agree that Current may change these Terms at any time without prior notice.
&nbsp;Current will endeavor to provide you with prior notice when there are any material changes, and may require that you subsequently take an affirmative action acknowledging agreement to the revised Terms before continuing to access the Service.
&nbsp;You may read a current, effective copy of these Terms at any time at https://currentmusic.us/terms.
&nbsp;The revised Terms will become effective at the time of posting on the Service, and your use of the Service after such time will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms.
&nbsp;If any change to these Terms is not acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop using the Service and terminating your Account (as defined in Section&nbsp;2.1).
&nbsp;Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section&nbsp;1.2, no revisions to these Terms will apply to any dispute between you and Current that arose prior to the effective date of those revisions.
</li>
<li> Additional Terms.
&nbsp;We may require you to agree to additional terms and/or policies that we make available to you from time-to-time in connection with your use of the Service, including, without limitation, any such terms that apply to contests that we run on the Service (“Additional Terms”).
&nbsp;Any such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into and subject to these Terms, and, absent express language to the contrary, these Terms will control in the event of any conflict or inconsistency with the Additional Terms to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
&nbsp.
</li>
<li> Consideration.
&nbsp;Current will provide you with access to the Service for free.
&nbsp;In return for enjoying free access to all or any portions of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that Current may generate revenues, increase goodwill or otherwise increase the value of Current from your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, through the collection of data and by displaying or performing advertising of any form (e.g., audio-only, display, audiovisual), and, except for your right to earn credits for use of the Service, &nbsp;you will otherwise have no right to share in any such revenues, goodwill or value whatsoever.
&nbsp;Current in its sole discretion may require the exchange of Current Credits to access certain features on the Service.
&nbsp;Current will provide you with advance notice of any such changes or the exchange of Current Credits before they take effect.
</li>

<li> Jurisdictional Issues.
&nbsp;The Service is controlled and operated by Current from its offices in the State of Illinois.
&nbsp;Current makes no representation that materials on the Service are appropriate, lawful or available for use in any locations other than the United States of America.
&nbsp;Those who choose to access or use the Service from locations outside the United States of America do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
&nbsp;Access to the Service from jurisdictions where the contents or practices of the Service are illegal, unauthorized or penalized is strictly prohibited.

&nbsp;The Service is or may be made available through computers, connected mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablet computers), and other connected devices (e.g., smart watches, set-top box, etc.) (collectively, “Mobile Services”).
&nbsp;When using the Service through Mobile Services, your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) or mobile carrier’s normal data, messaging and other fees and rates will apply, and you are solely responsible for paying such fees and rates.
&nbsp;Further, downloading, installing or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.

and (iii)&nbsp;you will indemnify and hold Current harmless from any and all claims arising out of your messages.
&nbsp;You are responsible for all fees and charges associated with your messages.
&nbsp;If a recipient of messages you send requests that we prevent you from sending additional messages to them through the Service, then we will abide by such recipient’s request and block you (and other users of the Service) from sending messages to such persons.

<li> Introduction.
Not Currency.
&nbsp;In order to reward Users for certain activities on the Service and to enable Users to obtain certain premium Services, Current, in its sole discretion, may offer Users the ability to purchase a license to our in-app virtual currency (“Current Credits”) that may be used to acquire virtual goods and services solely within the Service.
&nbsp;However, while we may use terms like “buy,” “purchase,” or “sell” in reference to Current Credits, such terminology is merely for convenience and does not mean that Current Credits has any particular value.
&nbsp;When you earn or purchase Current Credits, you obtain a license to Current Credits, which operate as virtual currency solely within the Service, and Current Credits do not (i)&nbsp;have an equivalent value in fiat currency.
(ii)&nbsp;act as a substitute for fiat currency.
or (iii)&nbsp;earn interest.
&nbsp;Current only transmits Current Credits as required to provide the Service as described in these Terms, which does not include money transmission services.
</li>
<li> Obtaining Current Credits.
&nbsp;Current may also allow you to obtain Current Credits: (i)&nbsp;when you consume advertisements in video, image, or audio form that appears before, during or after Content transmitted to you.
(ii)&nbsp;when you provide data to Current in the form of saves, votes, skips, or optional information such as your age, country or city, tastes and preferences, and answers to other survey questions.
(iii)&nbsp;by referring others to the Service.
(iv) by creating User Content (as defined in Section&nbsp;7.1) for the Service.
and (v) through such other methods as Current may offer from time to time.
&nbsp;If Current offers you the opportunity to acquire Current Credits, and you accept such offer, Current hereby grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, limited, non-transferable (except as expressly provided herein) right and license to use such Current Credits only in connection with the Service as permitted by us, subject to these Terms and your compliance with these Terms.
&nbsp;Current will credit to your Account any Current Credits acquired by you.
&nbsp;Your license to use Current Credits will terminate upon termination of these Terms or your account and as otherwise provided herein, except as otherwise required by applicable law.
&nbsp.
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> Lock-Screen Advertisements.
&nbsp;Current displays lock-screen advertisements on Android devices by default unless a User opts out of such functionality by updating the lock-screen advertisement settings in the App.
&nbsp;We offer this functionality to reward you for having installed the App on your mobile device.
&nbsp;For so long as you enable the functionality to receive lock-screen advertisements, you will be eligible to earn a fixed number of Current Credits for every day on which lock-screen advertisements are enabled regardless of whether you view or engage with the lock-screen advertisements.
&nbsp;Current will determine the number of Current Credits provided in connection with the receipt of lock-screen advertisements in its sole discretion.
&nbsp;You may find information on how many Current Credits you earn each day by reviewing your Current Credit history in the App.
</li>
<li> Personal Information.
&nbsp;You may also earn additional Current Credits by authorizing us to share your Personal Information (as defined in the Privacy Policy) and usage data on the Service with a Third Party Service.
&nbsp;Such opportunities will be clearly identified to you so that we can obtain your informed consent before sharing any of your personal information or usage data.
&nbsp.
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> Redeeming Current Credits.
&nbsp;Current may offer an opportunity to redeem Current Credits for (i) gift cards for use with participating third party merchants, and (ii) hard goods offered directly by Current (collectively, “Products”).
&nbsp;We will, in our sole discretion, determine and communicate the availability and exchange rate for any Current Credits, which may be modified at any time.
&nbsp;You must comply with any individual redemption limitations as indicated via the Service.
&nbsp;We reserve the right to cancel, restrict or terminate Current Credits or the ability to redeem Current Credits for Products at any time for any reason.
&nbsp;All Products are subject to availability.
&nbsp;You may choose a Product that is still available for which you have accumulated sufficient Current Credits for redemption.
&nbsp;Select the Product you wish to use and follow the instructions to complete the redemption process.
&nbsp.
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> Third-Party Merchants.
When you receive a Product, you will be able to utilize that Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of the third-party merchant and you will be bound by the terms and conditions of that merchant.
&nbsp;If you would like information regarding any of third-party merchants and the terms and conditions that govern such Products, please contact us at legal@currentmusic.us.
You will indemnify and hold Current harmless from any liability arising from your redemption of Current Credits for a Product or the use of any services accessed through the redemption of the Product.
&nbsp;You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged or lost shipments.
&nbsp;The redemption of Current Credits for any Products shall not transfer any intellectual property rights in any Products unless specifically noted.
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> Restrictions.
&nbsp;All redemptions of Current Credits are final, and Current does not offer refunds for any Current Credits redeemed for the acquisition of Products, except as required by applicable law.
&nbsp;Current Credits are not redeemable or exchangeable for fiat currency, monetary value, or convertible for other virtual currency from Current or any other third party, except as expressly provided in these Terms or otherwise required by applicable law.

&nbsp;Current Credits are not property, and you have no right, title or interest in any Current Credits.
&nbsp.

<li> Additional Limitations.
&nbsp;Current does not recognize or condone any third-party service that may be used to sell, exchange, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Current Credits, and Current does not assume any responsibility for, and will not support, such transactions.
&nbsp;Neither Current nor any third party has any obligation to exchange Current Credits for anything of value, including, but not limited to, fiat currency, except as expressly provided in these Terms or otherwise required by applicable law.

</ol>
<ol>
<li> Respect of Third Party Rights.
&nbsp;Current respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our Users to do the same.
&nbsp;Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service.
</li>
<li> Repeat Infringer Policy.
&nbsp;Current’s intellectual property policy is to (i)&nbsp;remove or disable access to material that Current believes in good faith or upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Service.
(ii)&nbsp;remove any User Content uploaded to the Service by “repeat infringers”.
and (iii)&nbsp;terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.
&nbsp;Current considers a “repeat infringer” to be any User that has uploaded User Content or Feedback (as defined in Section&nbsp;18) to or through the Service and for whom Current has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C.
§&nbsp;512 with respect to such User Content or Feedback.
&nbsp;Current has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon Current’s own determination.
&nbsp.
</li>
<li> Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.
&nbsp;If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below.
&nbsp;Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by Current with the User alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and you hereby consent to Current making such disclosure.

</ol>
<ol>
<li> A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed.

<li> Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, then a representative list of such works.
</li>
<li> Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Current to locate the material.
</li>
<li> Information reasonably sufficient to permit Current to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted.

<li> A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.
and </li>
<li> A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
&nbsp.

<li> Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
</li>
<li> A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
and </li>
<li> The subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which Current may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section&nbsp;8.4&nbsp;above or an agent of such person.

</li>
<li> False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.
&nbsp;The Copyright Act provides that: </li>
</ol>
<p> [a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section&nbsp;512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.
§&nbsp;512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [Current] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.
&nbsp.
</p>
<p>17 U.S.C.

<ol>
<li> Dispute Resolution.
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> Generally.
&nbsp;In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Current&nbsp;in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Current&nbsp;agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.
&nbsp;Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.
&nbsp;Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
&nbsp;Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
&nbsp;This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or&nbsp;after the termination of these Terms.
&nbsp;YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CURRENT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.
&nbsp.
</li>
<li> Exceptions.
&nbsp;Despite the provisions of Section&nbsp;16.1&nbsp;above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i)&nbsp;bring an individual action in small claims court.
(ii)&nbsp;pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.
(iii)&nbsp;seek injunctive relief&nbsp;in aid of arbitration from a court of law.
or (iv)&nbsp;file suit&nbsp;in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
</li>
<li> Arbitrator.
&nbsp;Any arbitration between you and Current will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.
&nbsp;The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Current.
&nbsp;The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
</li>
<li> Notice.
Process.
&nbsp;A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S.
Mail or electronic mail within the applicable statute of limitations period (“Notice”).
&nbsp;Current’s address for Notice is: Current Media LLC, 213 West Institute Place, Suite 307, Chicago, IL, 60610, United States of America.
&nbsp;The Notice must: (i)&nbsp;describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii)&nbsp;set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
&nbsp;The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Current may commence an arbitration proceeding.
&nbsp;During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Current must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
&nbsp;If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by Current prior to selection of an arbitrator, then Current will pay you the highest of the following: (X) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any.
(Y) the last written settlement amount offered by Current in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.
or (Z) $15,000.
</li>
<li> Fees.
&nbsp;If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then Current will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
&nbsp;Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Chicago, Illinois, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i)&nbsp;solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(ii)&nbsp;through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.
or (iii)&nbsp;by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
&nbsp;If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule&nbsp;of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
&nbsp;In that case, you agree to reimburse Current for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
&nbsp;Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
&nbsp;Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.
&nbsp;The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
</li>
<li> No Class Actions.
&nbsp;YOU AND CURRENT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN CLAIMS WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION 17).
&nbsp;Further, unless both you and Current agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
&nbsp.
</li>
<li> Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.
&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if Current makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Current’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Current’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Current.
&nbsp;If you do not send such written notice, then your continued use of the Service following any such change means that you have consented to such change.
</li>
<li> Enforceability.
&nbsp;If Section&nbsp;16.6&nbsp;above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section&nbsp;16&nbsp;is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section&nbsp;16&nbsp;will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described directly below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service.
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> Governing Law.
Choice of Forum.
</li>
</ol>
<p> The laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern these Terms and your use of the Service.
