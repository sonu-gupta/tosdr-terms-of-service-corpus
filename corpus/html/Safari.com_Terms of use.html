<li>Safari.com may, in its sole discretion, change this agreement or any part thereof at any time without notice.</li>
<li>Safari.com chooses as its domicilium citandi et executandi for all purposes under this agreement, whether in respect of court process, notice, or other documents or communication of whatsoever nature, 35 Hope Street, Gardens, Cape town, 8001, South Africa.</li>
<li>Safari.com operates as a guide to enable users to find, book and pay for, accommodation and packaged tours.
Safari.com thus acts as an advertising medium for these services and facilitates payments through the use of a payment gateway.
However, the contract is based on an offer by the establishment which is accepted by the guest and therefore exists legally between these two parties.
Safari.com's responsibility with regard to any transaction is to assist both parties to agree on a booking, to receive payment from the guest for the required amount, to pass such payment to the establishment/operator after deducting agreed commission and to provide the guest with a reservation reference number, if applicable.
The commission is only earned and brought to account once the client's arrangements have been completed.</li>
<li>Safari.com is also responsible for providing support to users of the website by means of the 'Contact Us' button.
In the event of a dispute between the guest and the establishment/operator, Safari.com will assist in resolving such dispute.
Safari.com does not, however, underwrite or guarantee bookings between the guest and establishment/operator or the accuracy of the information portrayed by the establishment/operator or in its quote.
In the event of any dispute between guest and establishment/operator, Safari.com will assist with the resolving of such disputes but is not liable to either party for any claims, damages or refunds of any type.</li>

<li>The establishment owner and/or operator agrees that guest comments can be published on the establishment listing by guests who have stayed at the establishment and further agrees that Safari.com is not liable or responsible in any way for the verification or accuracy of any guest comments made.</li>
<li>In terms of these standard trading conditions, and any contract/s concluded pursuant hereto, Safari.com acts as agent only for and on behalf of the client in procuring the services.

Safari.com shall, under no circumstances, be liable for the acts and omissions of the relevant third party suppliers concerned.</li>
<li>Neither Safari.com nor any of its agents or representatives shall be liable for any damage, loss or liability of whatsoever nature arising from the use or inability to use any services sold by Safari.com.</li>
<li>PAYMENT METHODS</li>
<li>
<strong>Credit card payments</strong>
<br>Safari.com has all your transactions protected by powerful Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer and other popular browsers.
SSL encrypts all your personal information before it travels over the Internet.
This makes doing online business just as secure as telephonic business.
SSL safe connection and secure transaction technology has effectively protected thousands of our customers who have transmitted their credit card numbers online and made a purchase since we launched.</li>
<li>Payment is only collected when a quotation has been received from the establishment, while the quotation has not yet expired and when the guest accepts the quotation.
Once payment has been made against a quotation, the offer and its acceptance become a binding contract.
Following acceptance the establishment is required to send confirmation of the booking.</li>
<li>Safari.com was the first company in South Africa to implement 3-D Secure (3DS) credit card security.
3DS is an added layer of security for online credit card transactions.
By requesting a pin number with the credit card details, fraud is greatly reduced.
It operates in the same way as taking money out of an ATM machine, requiring both the card and a PIN.<br>
<br>Most new credit cards are 3DS-enabled, and old cards can still be activated with 3DS through the cardholder's bank.
The advantage for buyers is when his/her card is activated by 3-D Secure, a login and password must be provided.
Merchants such as Safari.com do not have access to this security information, only the bank and their Access Control Server (ACS) have access to this information.</li>
<li>Customer details are separated from card details : No credit card details are stored at Safari.com</li>

<br>
<br>The SWIFT code needs to be used for international payments.</li>
<li>Such payments are required to be made at least 7 days before the expiry of a quotation, in order to allow sufficient time for the payment to clear into the Safari.com bank account.
The quotation (offer) is deemed accepted when the guest payment is received into the Safari.com bank account within the validity period.</li>
<li>Clients must pay the exact amount and must place a reference number on the deposit slip..</li>
<li>DEPOSITS</li>
<li>Any cancellation of a booking and/or service by a client must be sent in writing and be acknowledged by Safari.com in writing.
Clients should refer to their quotation and confirmation documentation for details regarding the payment schedule and cancellation terms.</li>
<li>Payment is made either of the minimum 50% deposit required or the full amount.
In certain circumstances the minimum deposit is equal to the full amount of the quotation.</li>
<li>As soon as payment has cleared into the Safari.com / Afritrip Group bank account, delivery has taken place on the part of the guest and the establishment is required to confirm the reservation and a reservation confirmation reference number is issued.
Delivery on the part of the establishment takes place when the guest has physically taken up the accommodation reserved.</li>
<li>Establishments may apply cancellation policies and these are clearly displayed on every quotation.
Cancellation policies will have implications for refunds and these are dealt with in <strong>clause 5</strong>.</li>
<li>Value added tax at 14% is charged by VAT registered establishments on bookings by South African residents.</li>
<li>CANCELLATION TERMS</li>
<li>In the event that you cancel your booking, in full or partially, for any reason whatsoever Safari.com will levy cancellation charges defined below.
In the occasional instance where Safari.com is able to obtain waivers of cancellation fees and/or secure an exgratia refund from suppliers Safari.com will pass this on to you less the service fee.
However, Safari.com makes no guarantees as to securing such waivers or refunds.<strong>DAYS PRIOR TO ARRIVALCANCELLATION FEES0-60 days prior100%61-90 days prior50%91+ days prior30%</strong>

If the cancellation notice is received outside of South African (SAST) business hours it will be deemed to be received in the first business hour following receipt of the notification.</em>
</li>
<li>Safari.com will make every effort to avoid misquotation, however if we have made an obvious error or omission which leads to a material cost implication we reserve the right to cancel a reservation without liability or penalty, or to allow you to make a top up payment to accommodate for such error or omission.</li>
<li>Safari.com reserves the right to levy a 5% admin charge on credit card and bank transfer refunds due to cancellations.</li>

<blockquote>We had an amazing first safari…</blockquote>
<blockquote>We had an amazing first safari experience with Safari.com! 💯Thanks to Dolan for the well planning and ensure our itinerary goes smoothly and safely!</blockquote>CSY, ZA<blockquote>Oct 21, 2022</blockquote>
<blockquote>Superior service, knowledgeable, transparent, amazing can-do attitude</blockquote>
<blockquote>These guys get 10/10.
I have booked with them a few times.
To Kruger National Park, including both public and private(concession) camps, flights and car hire.
Their senior agent, Dolan is exceptional.
Nothing is too much trouble.
Attention to detail, transparency, and 'can-do' attitude are out of the ordinary.
I recently came into contact with Tanya at safari.com as well.
It looks like all their agents are similarly well trained.
Thank you.
I cannot recommend Dolan and his team highly enough.</blockquote>customer, AU<blockquote>Nov 18, 2022</blockquote>
<blockquote>Cape Town miracle</blockquote>
<blockquote>I was in Cape Town, South Africa recently for an athletic competition and had allowed myself a week of personal time to relax and properly conclude the trip, but had not bothered to plan a safari to occupy the time.
I was skeptical of the cost and whether I would enjoy the experience, however a couple days into that final week it occurred to me, in a bit of a panic attack, what a waste it would be not to take advantage of this opportunity.
I hopped online and started looking at flights to Johannesburg (almost all the safaris in SA start there with an early morning pick up), but it was basically impossible to get a flight early enough and/or to coordinate with the multiple safaris operating in or just outside of Kruger.
With no apparent options available to turn my remaining 4 1/2 days into even a 3 day safari I stumbled on the most obvious website one could imagine, Safari.com.
I'd completely given up negotiating all the variables on my own but here was a safari travel agent that might be able to help me ..
and they were based right out of Cape Town, literally a stones throw from my lodgings.
Serendipity, or so i hoped.
I immediately sent out an email and crossed my fingers ..
for roughly an hour and a half, at which point Dolan from Safari.com responded to me requesting I give him a call so that we could expedite potential arrangements.
My in country phone plan wasn't able to make calls, but we arranged for him to call me and not 3 hours after being in the grip of despair Dolan got through to me and far from notifying me of how absurd it was to hold out hope for a literally, last minute safari adventure with barely 4 days available to me, he had already worked out all the details I'd sent and created a preliminary safari trip that would bypass Johannesburg airport for a flight the next morning to a closer, much, much smaller airport where I would be picked up taken, not to a 3 day safari, but a full 4 day safari, then back to the tiny, tiny airport for a return flight to Cape Town with 2 hours to spare for my return leg all the way home.
It almost feels like an afterthought, after the minor miracle Dolan was able to conjure up, but the safari itself at Simbavati Lodge was just an absolutely stunning experience.
The single "tent" he booked me was as luxurious as any 4 star hotel I've stayed in, the game drives, one every morning, one every evening were more amazing than I could have ever imagined, and the food, 3 meals a day with snacks and an open bar was sublime.
I could go on about the wonderful staff, or the wonderful other safari goers you can meet and grab a drink with, or the different animals walking through the open lodge facilities daily ..
but I've gone on long enough.
I'll simply conclude by saying ..
safari, absolutely, yes, do it, it is amazing.
