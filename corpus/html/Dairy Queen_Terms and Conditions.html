Conditions (the “Terms”) apply?&nbsp;</strong>

<u>U.S.

Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court.
Please review this section carefully.</strong>

Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law.
Arbitration will be held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.
The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your claim.
