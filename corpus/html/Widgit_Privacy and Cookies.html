<p>The information we collect during product registration and usage:</p>
<p>Some of our desktop software collects anonymous usage statistics.
You can turn this setting off during installation or in the program's settings after installation.</p>

<p>Your product registration details will be kept for up to two years after update support for that version of the product ends.
Your product registration details will only ever be used to identify you as the owner of the product, and only then when there is a good reason for doing so.

<p>You can access, edit, delete or request a copy of your product registration details by contacting Widgit.
You can also ask us to restrict how your product registration details are processed.
If you want to access, edit, delete, restrict or request a copy of your product registration details then you will need to provide your product key and some of your registration details to confirm that you are the registered product owner.</p>
