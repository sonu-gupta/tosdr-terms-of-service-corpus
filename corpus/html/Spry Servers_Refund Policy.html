<strong>Money Back Guarantee</strong>
We offer a 30 day money back guarantee on many items.
If you are not satisfied with your purchase for any reason, on any shared hosting product, SSL certificate, or reseller hosting account, you may request a full refund within 30 (thirty) days of your original purchase.
Your refund will be processed within 1-2 weeks, and credited back to your method of payment automatically.
We are not responsible for bank holds.
Domain name registrations and dedicated servers are non-refundable.
If you purchase a plan that comes with a free domain name, you will receive a credit for the hosting plan minus the cost of said domain name at the current applicable market rate.
If you request a refund, but any IPs we have assigned your account have been blacklisted in any database, you will not be refunded.
Cryptocurrency payments are excluded from the money back guarantee policy.
All sales are final if you paid with cryptocurrency.
When PayPal is used as a payment method, refunds will be given, less any PayPal transaction fees.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Duplicate Payments/PayPal Subscriptions</strong>
It is the customer's responsibility to manage their PayPal subscription.
If a customer signs up with a subscription, then pays their invoice manually the next month without cancelling the subscription, a duplicate payment will be made.
In these scenarios, we will not refund payment to the customer's PayPal account.
If customer has made an accidental payment/overpayment for any reason, any and all refund due will be credited to the customer's Spry Servers balance.
The balance is non-transferrable and has no cash value outside of purchasing products and services from Spry Servers.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Refunds</strong>
We do not offer refunds on products and services not explicitly defined within our money back guarantee.
We reserve the right to decline repetitive refund requests for similar products or services at our discretion.
Additionally, abuse of our refund policy may result in you and/or your company being reported to FraudRecord.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Chargebacks</strong>
Any and all charge disputes must be reported directly to Spry Servers within thirty (30) days of the date which the charge originally occurred.
If a charge which is deemed valid by Spry Servers, and validated by our Terms of Service or AUP, is disputed to a financial institution by performing a charge-back, you will be notified by e-mail.
If the chargeback was accidental ("friendly fraud"), you must notify the issuing bank (request to reverse chargeback) and Spry Servers, LLC no later than 7 calendar days after you receive communication from us that a chargeback has been initiated.
If we do not hear from you within 7 calendar days, we will assume it was genuine fraud or abuse of your cardholder agreement.
Your service will be terminated and your account will be closed.
If you wish to re-open your account, the client agrees to pay (with a different payment method), an 'Administrative Fee' of $250 in addition to original amount of funds which were reclaimed.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Non-Payment/Late Fees/Service Interruption</strong>
Accounts, unless otherwise explicitly defined, will be deactivated after 2 days from the invoice due date if payment is not received.
We realize everyone falls on hard financial times.
If you need extra time, please let us know so we can work out a payment arrangement.
Any account deactivated due to non-payment will require a reactivation fee of at least $10.00 or 10% of the total amount in arrears (whichever amount is greater, up to the maximum allowed by law).
(typically billed on the following cycle) Data stored on a client’s services will not be available to the client until re-connection is established or alternative arrangements are made to the sole satisfaction of Spry Servers, LLC.
For dedicated and cloud servers, suspension/deactivation will occur within (2) days of invoice due date.
Clients deactivated for non-payment or charge-back are subject to their data being destroyed seven (5) days from invoice due date for dedicated/cloud servers and (7) days from suspension/charge-back date for shared hosting or reseller accounts.
Spry Servers, LLC is not responsible for data integrity, regardless of circumstance.
Spry Servers, LLC strongly recommends keeping up to date and off network backups to protect against data loss.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Cancellation Refunds</strong>
We DO NOT refund partial payment term fees to any accounts.
Notice of at least 24 hours before your invoice due date must be given for service cancellation.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Account Balances/Pre-paid Funds</strong>
Pre-paid account balances are non-transferrable and have no cash value outside of purchasing products and services from Spry Servers.
