What is Do Not Track (DNT)?
DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings.
However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal.
As we need to use cookies for the purposes explained in this policy, and we do not intentionally track you when you use other websites, Similar Worlds does not respond to "do not track" signals.
