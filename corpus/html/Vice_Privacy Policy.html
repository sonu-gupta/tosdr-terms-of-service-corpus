<b>

<p>
<b>
<i> Right to Opt Out of Sale</i>
</b> – You have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information to third parties.
From January 1, 2020, you can exercise this right through the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link on our Sites or by contacting us using the contact information provided at the end of this section.
Please note we do not sell the Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i> Right to Non-Discrimination</i>
</b> – You have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.</p>
<p>If you would like to exercise one or more of the above rights, please contact us using the contact information provided at the end of this section.
We may need you to provide additional information to verify your request, such as providing certain data elements so that we can confirm they match the Personal Information already maintained by us.
We will not use this additional information for anything other than handling your request.
You may designate an authorized agent to make a request in certain circumstances on your behalf.
Such authorized agent must be registered with the California Secretary of State.
We will endeavor to respond to all such requests within forty-five (45) days, although there may be a brief delay in processing a request while we verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party.
If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
</p> OTHER CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS <p>Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request, once a year, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and the categories of Personal Information the company shares.
Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as VICE does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice.
As stated below in this Privacy Policy, VICE provides you choice prior to sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
If you do not opt in or if you choose to opt out at the time VICE offers that choice, VICE does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, please note that we may, on occasion, share a portion of our postal mailing list with other reputable organizations not owned or affiliated with VICE who want to market products or services to you.
If you do not want your name and address shared with other organizations or you no longer wish to receive Store catalogs, please contact Store customer service at vicemerch@thevandalcollective.com.
We will not sell, lease, or transfer this mailing list to any third parties except for this reason.</p> CONTACT INFORMATION <p>If you are a California resident and you have questions about our privacy practices or would like to exercise one or more of the rights listed above, please send your request to the following email address: USprivacy@vice.com or write to us at the following mailing address:</p>

<p>The Store is operated by Vandal Collective.
Certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which they may handle your Personal Information.</p>

We will not use the information provided via these functions to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless we disclose otherwise at the time you submit your request.

<p>Also, if you choose to "like" content on one of the Sites, to tweet from the Sites or to otherwise post information from or via the Sites to a third party web site, feature or application, that information may be public and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Sites.</p> INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE ABOUT A THIRD PARTY <p>If you send someone else a communication from the Sites, such as sending a video to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person.</p> INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY AS YOU ACCESS AND USE THE SITES <p>We, as well as any third-party advertisers, service providers and content providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain Site usage information whenever you visit or interact with us or our content found elsewhere on the internet (" Usage Information").
Usage Information may include browser type, operating system, all of the areas within our Sites that you visit, including content that you browse, and the time of day, among other information.
We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Sites and our services.
In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the particular device you use to access the Sites.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the Sites and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.
Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access our Sites.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>The methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:</p>
<i>COOKIES</i>
<p>A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit one of our Sites or otherwise access our online content.
Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.</p>
<p>A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device.
Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences.
For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en....
If you choose to disable cookies or to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device, some features of the Sites may not function properly.</p>
<i>WEB BEACONS</i>
<p>Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in the Sites' web pages and e-mail messages.
Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.
Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails sent were actually opened or to count how many forwarded links were actually viewed.</p>
<i>EMBEDDED SCRIPTS</i>
<p>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies on the Sites that collect information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p>
<i>APP TECHNOLOGIES</i>
<p>App technologies are technologies included in our apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.
For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server.
These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our service with your social media account.</p>
<b>
<i>LOCATION-IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGIES</i>
</b>
<p>Location-Identifying Technologies are technologies used to collect your location.
For example, GPS, WiFi, and Bluetooth may be used to collect precise location data when you consent to precise location tracking through our apps.
Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.</p> HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS <p>Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to websites and online services that you visit.
There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context.
Like many websites and online services, VICE does not alter its practices when it receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser.
To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p> INFORMATION THIRD PARTIES PROVIDE ABOUT YOU AND SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS <p>We may receive information about you from third parties.
For example, if you are on another web site and you agree to receive information from a Site or VICE, that web site will forward your contact and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested.
You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature on our Sites (such as posting to your page on a third party service or otherwise linking the Sites with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you post content or allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information.
The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy.
The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service.
The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.
In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site, application or interactive service.</p>
<p>We also may verify or supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Sites.
In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p> HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT <p>VICE may use your information, including your Personal Information: (1) to allow you to participate in features we offer.

We do not share your Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' marketing purposes unless you first agree to such sharing (either by opting in or choosing not to opt out at the time we provide the choice).
We may share the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information or otherwise with your consent, and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i> When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties Or Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information</i>

If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</p>
<p>You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third party application, that we share information about you with a third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances.
For example, if you "like" content on our Sites, information about you may transfer to the third party offering that application on our Sites and to the third party web site to which you are posting.</p>
<p>

<i> Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf</i>
