The Services are intended for residents in the countries where they are being offered.
For example, Services being offered at ancestry.ca are intended for users in Canada.</p>
<p>If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the Services (excluding any Services requiring a DNA test) with your parent's or guardian's permission.
Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use any Services.
We do not knowingly seek or collect any Personal Information directly from children under the age of 13.

A parent or legal guardian may activate a DNA test, (excluding an AncestryHealth® test), provide us Personal Information, and send us the saliva sample of their own minor child for processing using their account.
By activating a DNA test for, or submitting any Personal Information about, a minor you represent that you are the minor’s parent or legal guardian.
You also agree that you have discussed the DNA test with the minor and the minor has agreed to the collection and processing of their saliva.</p>

<strong>Unexpected Results</strong>: When using our Services, you may discover unexpected facts about yourself, your family, or your health (e.g.

Once discoveries are made, we can’t undo them.</p>
<p>1.4.&nbsp;<u>Additional Terms Applicable to Use of DNA Services</u>
</p>
<p>As used in these Terms, “<strong>DNA Services</strong>” refers to the use of our DNA collection kit, processing and handling of your DNA sample, genetic testing of your DNA sample, and our web or mobile app-based tools that provide you with ethnicity and other genetically related results and associated services, including AncestryHealth®, if applicable.

and,</li>
<li>You will not use the information obtained from the DNA Services (including any downloaded DNA Data (defined in the Privacy Statement)) in whole, in part and/or in combination with any other database, for any medical, diagnostic, or paternity testing purpose, in any judicial proceeding, or for any discriminatory purpose or illegal activity.</li>

<li>Perform genetic tests in the United States (or, in the future, in other countries) on the resulting DNA using test methods available now or developed;</li>

</ul>
<p>We protect your information as described in our Privacy Statement.
If you choose to download a copy of your DNA Data, that copy is not protected by our security measures and you are solely responsible for storing, securing, and protecting that downloaded data.
Ancestry has no responsibility if you elect to share or transfer your downloaded DNA Data with others, either intentionally or inadvertently.
Your DNA Data is intended only for your personal use.</p>
<p>
<u>Note to Users who have received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant</u>: The purpose of the DNA Services is to provide genetic and genealogy results and related reports for your informational, recreational, educational and research use.
If you have received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, your AncestryDNA test may provide unexpected results because your saliva may contain cells with your DNA as well as cells with your donor’s DNA.
DNA for the test is extracted from the cells, and the combination of DNA sources can result in a failed test or a test that provides results based on your donor’s DNA.
Therefore, we recommend that those who have received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant do not take the AncestryDNA® test.
If you have already taken the test, please contact us for further assistance.</p>

If you have any concern or dispute about the Services, you agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us.</p> For U.S.
Customers: <p>You and Ancestry agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p>
<p>If any dispute between us is not resolved within 30 days after contacting us, then you and Ancestry agree that we will resolve it through final and binding arbitration, with the following three exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>1.
You may assert your dispute, if it qualifies, in small claims court.</li>
<li>2.
Both you and Ancestry may bring a suit in court in the state of Utah only for a claim of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
In this case, we both waive any right to a jury trial.</li>
<li>3.
If it qualifies, you may bring a claim to the attention of a relevant federal, state, or local agency that may seek relief against us on your behalf.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a subscription and you terminate for our breach after providing us with a 30-day cure period during which we are unable to cure, we will refund any pre-paid fees on a pro-rated basis to you.</p>
<p>
<u>Arbitration Rules</u>: Arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Statement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Statement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com).
(b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, California 94111.
and (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Ancestry at Ancestry Legal Department, 153 Townsend Street, Suite 800, San Francisco, CA 94107.
Arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing.
You and Ancestry further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>
<u>Fees</u>: You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us.
If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Ancestry will pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses.
You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>
<p>
<u>No Class Actions</u>: <strong>You and Ancestry each agree that each party may only resolve disputes with the other on an individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.</strong> If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>
<u>Changes to This Section</u>: Ancestry will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any changes affecting the substance of this section by posting notice of modifications to the Terms on the Services, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account.
Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Services or sent to you.</p>
<p>Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.
If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Dispute, Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.</p>
<p>
<u>Survival</u>: This Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your account or the Services.</p> For Customers Outside the U.S.: <p>You agree that the Irish Courts will have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes (contractual or non-contractual) related to this Agreement.
If you are a European Union consumer you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident.
Nothing in this Agreement, including the paragraph above, affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.
Nothing contained in this clause shall limit Ancestry’s rights to bring enforcement proceedings in another jurisdiction or to seek interim, protective or provisional relief in the courts of another jurisdiction.</p>
