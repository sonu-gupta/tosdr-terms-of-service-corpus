6.0 PAYMENT POLICY
<p>
<strong>6.1 Payment Terms</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>When upgrading from the free Ryver Team Communication service to one of the premium services such as Team Task Manager, fees are specified in the “Upgrade” form, and must be paid in advance.
Payments and Payment Obligations for services are non-refundable.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>6.2 Cancellation</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you cancel your service in the middle of a period that has already been paid for, you will continue to have access to that service for the remainder of the subscription period.
Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>6.3 Subscription Renewal</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscriptions will be automatically renewed at the interval determined at time of purchase (monthly/yearly).
Failure to process the credit card on file will result in multiple retries over a seven day period, during which the paid service will continue to be available.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>6.4 Unpaid Subscriptions</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>After 7 days, the account will be considered unpaid, and the customer may be downgraded to the free service level.

</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to “downgrade” from a higher cost plan to a lower cost plan, or from a yearly payment to monthly.

<p>
<strong>11.1</strong> “Confidential Information” means all confidential and proprietary information of a party disclosed either before or after the effective date of these Terms and marked as such (if such information is capable of being so marked) regarding such party’s products and business that are disclosed by such party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Non-Disclosing Party”) under these Terms including, but not limited to, the Disclosing Party’s intellectual property.
Confidential Information also includes (a) the unpublished prices and other terms of service, audit reports, data center designs and other proprietary technology and (b) all information transmitted to or from, stored on or otherwise processed by the servers or other devices used in the provision of the Service.
Confidential Information does not include information: (i) in the public domain at the time of delivery, (ii) subsequently published or otherwise made part of the public domain through no fault of the Non-Disclosing Party or its representatives, (iii) in the Non-Disclosing Party’s possession at the time of disclosure and not acquired by the Non-Disclosing party directly or indirectly from Disclosing Party or its representatives on a confidential basis, (iv) which becomes available to the Non-Disclosing Party on a non-confidential basis from a source not under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, or (v) information that is independently developed without reference to the Confidential Information, as evidenced by written records maintained in the ordinary course of business.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.2</strong> Each party will safeguard and keep confidential all Confidential Information of the other and will return the other’s Confidential Information upon request, except to the extent further retention of such Confidential Information is necessary for a party to perform any post-termination obligations or exercise any post-termination rights under these Terms.
Each party agrees to safeguard the other’s Confidential Information using measures that are equal to the standard of performance used by the Non-Disclosing to safeguard its own Confidential Information of comparable value, but in no event less than reasonable care.
Neither party will use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except to implement its rights and obligations under these Terms and as otherwise expressly contemplated by these Terms.
provided, however, that if any party or its representatives is requested or required to disclose any Confidential Information by a subpoena or court order, that party will promptly notify the other party (unless prohibited by such subpoena or order) of such request or requirement so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate relief and/or waive compliance with provisions of these Terms, and if, in the absence of such relief or waiver hereunder, any party or its representative are, in the opinion of its counsel, legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, then that party may disclose so much of the Confidential Information the person compelling disclosure as is, according to such opinion, required, without liability hereunder.</p>
