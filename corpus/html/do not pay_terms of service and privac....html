How the Airline/Hotel Service Works
<p>We provide our Service automatically by tracking customer policies and applicable laws at popular online websites.
Where we see a potential savings or refund opportunity based on your purchase history, we will interact with Merchants on your behalf using your details to attempt to get you the benefit.

<p>By registering for the Service, you may be required to link your personal email account, such as Google (“Linked Accounts”), to the Service.

</p>
Links to Other Internet Web Sites
<p>Some of the Web sites listed as links herein are not under the control of DoNotPay, but rather are exclusively controlled by third parties.
Accordingly, DoNotPay makes no representations whatsoever concerning such Web sites.
Although DoNotPay may provide a link to a third party, such a link is not an authorization, endorsement, sponsorship or affiliation by DoNotPay with respect to such Web site, its owners or its providers.
DoNotPay is providing these links only as a convenience to you.
DoNotPay has not tested any information, products or software found on such Web sites and therefore cannot make any representations whatsoever with respect thereto.
It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IN NO EVENT WILL DoNotPay BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY USE OF ANY HYPERLINKED WEB SITE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR OTHER DATA ON YOUR INFORMATION HANDLING SYSTEM OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE ARE EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<strong>About These Terms</strong>
<p>If there is any inconsistency between these Terms and any additional terms we may add, the additional terms will prevail.
These terms govern the relationship between DoNotPay and you.
They do not create any third-party beneficiary rights.&nbsp;If you do not comply with these Terms and we do not take action immediately, this does not mean we are forfeiting any rights that we may have.
We may still take action in the future.
If any particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>Paid Services.</strong> DoNotPay may offer Services to be paid for on a recurring basis (“Subscription Services”) or on an as-used basis (“A La Carte Services” and, together with the Subscription Services, “Paid Services”).
DoNotPay has the right to change, delete, discontinue or impose conditions on Paid Services or any feature or aspect of a Paid Service.
Subscription Services may subject you to recurring fees and/or terms.
By signing up for a Subscription Service, including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription fee and any applicable taxes as set forth in your DoNotPay Account settings or as otherwise agreed in writing (“Subscription Fee”).
If you sign up for Subscription Services for a period (“Initial Period”), then the terms will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Period at our then-current fee for such Subscription Services.
In order to avoid automatic renewal, you must cancel your Subscription Services at least 2 calendar days (48 hours) prior to the automatic renewal date.
You may cancel your account online (in account settings) or by sending an email to support@donotpay.com.</p>
Recouping Payments and Additional Contributions:
DoNotPay requires ACH bank account access or payment details for three reasons:
<ol>
<li>To send you any money reclaimed from corporations and governments.</li>
<li>To process any payments made in the app, including your subscription to DoNotPay.</li>
<li>To process any external government/corporation fees to help you complete your task.
For example, if you ask DoNotPay to pay your parking ticket for you, it will debit the cost of paying the parking ticket from your connected account.
DoNotPay will always secure permission in writing from you before debiting any external fees.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will recoup payment directly from your connected account.
By using our&nbsp;services, you authorize us to initiate debit and credit entries to your&nbsp;bank account, or if you link a debit card to your account, you authorize&nbsp;us to charge your debit card, for all payments due to us.&nbsp;You agree to maintain a balance that is sufficient to fund all payments&nbsp;you initiate.
If the balance is insufficient, you authorize us to recoup payment from your connected account over nominal increments.
However, DoNotPay will attempt to avoid charging your&nbsp;bank account if we believe your bank account does not contain&nbsp;sufficient funds to cover payment.</p>
<p>Our failure to charge your bank account for repayment within a set&nbsp;amount of time does not constitute a waiver of our right to charge your&nbsp;account for such funds.
You represent and warrant that you have the&nbsp;right to authorize us to charge your account for payments due to us&nbsp;under these Terms.
You will indemnify and hold DoNotPay harmless&nbsp;from any claims by any other owner of the account.</p>
<p>DoNotPay’s authorization to initiate debit and credit entries to your&nbsp;bank account will remain in full force and effect until you revoke your&nbsp;authorization.
If you wish to revoke your authorization, you may do so&nbsp;by contacting support@DoNotPay.com at least three business days&nbsp;before the day a transaction is scheduled.
Please note that your&nbsp;revocation of authorization when transactions are pending could result&nbsp;in delays to your receipt of funds and additional charges owed by you&nbsp;to DoNotPay.
You are responsible for any costs or damages related to&nbsp;the timing of authorization revocation.</p>
<p>DoNotPay is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees,&nbsp;or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or&nbsp;similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or&nbsp;available credit in the bank account that is sufficient to fund all&nbsp;payments you initiate.</p>
<p>In order to allow you to use certain Services, we may be required to&nbsp;verify your identity.
You authorize us to make any inquiries we&nbsp;consider necessary to validate your identity.
These inquiries may&nbsp;include asking you for further information, requiring you to provide a&nbsp;taxpayer identification number, requiring you to take steps to confirm&nbsp;ownership of your email address or financial instruments, ordering a&nbsp;credit report, or verifying information you provide against third party&nbsp;databases or through other sources.
If you do not provide this&nbsp;information or we cannot verify your identity, we can decline to allow&nbsp;you to use the Services.</p>
