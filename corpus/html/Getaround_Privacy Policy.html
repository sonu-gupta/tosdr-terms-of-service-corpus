Information that Getaround provides in response to CCPA Requests shall, to the extent feasible, be in a readily usable format.
Getaround shall specify the purposes for collecting the information, and the types of third parties with whom the information has been shared.</p>
<p>Members who are California residents may also submit a CCPA Request to Getaround for the deletion of their information.
However, Getaround may be required to retain certain information in order to comply with other applicable laws, detect or prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, assist with or process claims, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, comply with audits and investigations, enforce its Terms of Service and associated policies, and take other actions reasonably necessary, permitted, or required by applicable law.</p>

In response to a CCPA Request, Getaround will verify that the request has been submitted by a Member associated with the account to which the request relates.
In connection with this verification process, Members may be asked to provide government-issued identification to Getaround.</p>
<p>Members who are residents of California may designate an authorized agent to submit a CCPA Request on their behalf.
To do so, the authorizing Member must submit to Getaround the Member’s government-issued identification, the authorized agent’s government-issued identification, and a valid power of attorney signed by the authorizing Member.</p>

</p>How We Protect Your Information<p>Getaround cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers.
&nbsp;However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.
&nbsp;In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account.
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information and for controlling access to your email communications from Getaround, at all times.</p>Children's Privacy<br>

If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us here.</p>Links to Other Websites<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein.

We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>Changes to Our Privacy Policy<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it.
