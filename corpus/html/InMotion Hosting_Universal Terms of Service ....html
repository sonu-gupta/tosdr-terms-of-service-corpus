<li>These Universal Terms, the Policies, Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy shall collectively be referred to as the “Agreements.” Unless otherwise stated in a Policy, in the event of a conflict between the provisions of these Universal Terms and the terms in the Policies, Acceptable Use Policy or Privacy Policy, the provisions of these Universal Terms shall control.</li>

<li>Company may offer pricing in various currencies.
The transaction(s) will be processed in the selected currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount submitted for payment.
For certain payment methods, the issuer of Customer’s payment method may charge Customer a foreign transaction fee or other charge(s), which may be added to the final amount that appears on Customer’s bank statement or post as a separate amount.
Customer should check with the issuer of Customer’s payment method for details.
