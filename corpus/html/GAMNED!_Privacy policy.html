<b>GAMNED! PRIVACY POLICY</b>
</p>
<p>Free access to many websites on the Internet is made possible by the distribution of advertisements by advertisers.
These advertisements can be targeting the needs and expectations of the Internet users concerned or non-targeted, which are less likely to interest them.
In all cases, Internet users are exposed to advertisements.</p>
<p>Advertisers, for their part, are also interested in displaying their offers to users they know are interested in them.</p>
<p>When Gamned! (or “<b>We</b>“, “<b>Us</b>“, “<b>Our</b>“) is mandated by an advertiser, Our mission is to accommodate the interests of Internet users and advertisers.
To that end, We strive to preserve the confidentiality and security of the personal data that we process in the context of the campaigns entrusted to us by our advertising clients, i.e.
any information that makes it possible to identify, directly (surname, first name, profile photo, etc.) or indirectly (client or advertiser identifier, IP address, etc.) a natural person (the “<b>Personal Data</b>“).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this end, we have put in place strict procedures and made strong commitments which are described in this document (the “<b>Privacy Policy</b>“).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>1.
When does the Privacy Policy apply?</b>
</p>
<p>The Privacy Policy applies as soon as you voluntarily communicate (by having given your authorization for an advertiser to send you targeted advertising, etc.) or as soon as Gamned! collects your Personal Data (by subscribing to Our newsletter, by creating a customer account with Our sales department).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>2.
Who are We?</b>
</p>
<p>Gamned! is a trading desk and a publisher of programmatic solutions.
Information about Gamned ! is available on our Legal Notice.</p>
<p>Gamned! is listed as a vendor in the Transparency and Consent Framework of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe – an association of advertising producers on the web.
Such a listing allows Internet users to choose, on any website equipped with a Consent Management Platform, which data it allows which entities to collect.</p>
<p>
<b>
</b>In addition, Gamned! follows the recommendations of the YOC platform “<b>Youronlinechoices</b>” which allows users to disable any cookies that Gamned! and other member companies have placed on their computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>3.
What are Our commitments?</b>
</p>

<p>Gamned! is committed to process your Personal Data in the strict respect of the Regulation (as defined below), the lawful instructions of our clients – data controllers – and this Privacy Policy.</p>

The processing will only be carried out for the time necessary to achieve the purposes concerned and within the framework of strict security and confidentiality measures.</p>
<p>These purposes have, moreover, been brought to the attention of Our Data Protection Officer (DPO) during the prior formalities carried out with the latter.</p>
