         Earning American Express Membership Rewards® Points on Rakuten <p>Some American Express Card Members are enrolled in a program that allows them to shop with Rakuten to earn Membership Rewards points on every purchase.
If you’re in this program, you’ll still see Cash Back mentioned in many places on Rakuten.
However, the Cash Back you earn will be converted into points, and your points will be transferred to your Membership Rewards account.</p>
<p>
<strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>How do I link my Membership Rewards® program account to a Rakuten account?</strong>
</p>
<p>First, become a new Rakuten member and then sign in when prompted, using your Amex online account credentials.
Once you’re authenticated as a Card Member enrolled in the Membership Rewards program, your new Rakuten account will be linked to your Membership Rewards program account.</p>
<p>
<strong>How can I earn Membership Rewards points on Rakuten?</strong>
</p>
<p>Once you’ve become a new member and linked your Membership Rewards program account, you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop: Start shopping with Rakuten.
Find the store you want to shop on Rakuten and click the “Shop Now” link.</li>
<li>Validate: When you click on a “Shop Now” link, you’ll see a confirmation letting you know you’re ready to shop at that store.</li>
<li>Purchase: Place your order as you normally would.</li>
</ul>
<p>1% Cash Back is equal to 1 additional point for every $1 spent through Rakuten.
Once the store lets Rakuten know you’ve made a purchase, Rakuten will add the Membership Rewards points you earned (that are additional to the points earned normally on the Card) to your Rakuten account.
Afterwards, Rakuten will send you an email confirmation which, depending on the store, can take a few hours to several days.
Rakuten will transfer the points in your Rakuten account to your Membership Rewards program account in accordance with Rakuten’s current payment schedule.</p>
