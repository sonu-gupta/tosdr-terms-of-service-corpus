FEES AND PAYMENTS</strong>
</strong>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS</strong>
</p>
<p>You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you order the Services.
GoDaddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.
If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specifically noted (for reasons such as those highlighted in Section 2(x) above), the renewal price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale) price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart prior to purchase.
For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also $9.99.
Likewise, if a domain name has a sale price of $8.99, with the list (non-sale) price shown (as a strike-through) at $9.99, the renewal price will be $9.99*.
</p>
<p>
<small>* Renewal price subject to change prior to actual date of renewal.</small>
</p>
<p>For all other terms and conditions relating to fees, payment, refund and billing, etc.
applicable to the Services offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the “Fees and Payments” section of our Universal Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(B) DOMAIN NAME RENEWAL TERMS_</strong>
</p>
<p>When you register a domain name, you will have the following renewal options: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> Automatic Renewal is the default setting.
Domain names will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, and payment will be taken from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current rates.
Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) year.
If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.
If you wish to change your automatic renewal term to a different period from your original term, as of 16 July 2020, you may manually renew the domain registration to establish a new default automatic renewal term for the domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Manual Renewal.</strong> If you have elected to turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel the domain name registration) effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its expiration date by logging into your Account Manager and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed).
If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.
Domain name renewals will be non-refundable.
In the event that we are unable to automatically renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.
If for any reason GoDaddy is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire.
It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.
</p>
<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .br, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration.</p>
<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal will occur, or must occur manually if the product was previously cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.
For some ccTLDs (.es) renewal must be processed no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.
When the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling GoDaddy and requesting that the domain name be renewed.
You cannot renew the domain name through your Account Manager.
If you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.
</p>
<p>You agree that GoDaddy will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement.
In any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply.
If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance.
</p>
<p>If you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf.
If GoDaddy decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you must reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal and keep your domain name.
The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period after the expiration date of the domain name.
If you do not reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay GoDaddy a Redemption fee.
</p>
<p>The Redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.
During the redemption period your domain name may be parked.</p>
<p>If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay GoDaddy a redemption fee and redeem your domain name.
The redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
<p>Renewal Grace Periods and Redemption Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs.
Please refer to the specific terms for the applicable TLD.
In the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.</p>
<p>Our registration expiration notification policy and associated fees are described here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(C) FREE PRODUCT TERMS</strong>
</p>
<p>In the event you are provided with free products with the registration of a domain name, you acknowledge and agree that such free products will only be available with a valid purchase and may be terminated in the event the domain name is deleted or cancelled.
For free domain names, you acknowledge and agree that you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the first five (5) days after registration.
In the event a free domain name is offered with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered fails, then we may, in its sole discretion, either delete the registration of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the value of the free domain.
Failed registrations associated with promotional offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item or an adjustment between the registered domain price and the value of the discounted item, in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>
</p>
<strong>
<strong>4.
TERM OF AGREEMENT.
TRANSFERS.
DOMAIN TASTING</strong>
</strong>
<p>The term of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as you have any domain name registered through GoDaddy.
</p>
<p>You agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through GoDaddy to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration date.
You agree that you may not transfer any domain name for ten (10) days after a Change of Account.
</p>
<p>You further agree that you will not engage in "domain tasting" by using the five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability or viability of a domain name.
If GoDaddy determines (which determination shall be made by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging in "domain tasting", then GoDaddy reserves the right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether.
GoDaddy will not charge you a fee if GoDaddy cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control.
The five (5) day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable.
</p>
<p>You agree that GoDaddy shall not be bound by (i) any representations made by third parties who you may use to purchase services from GoDaddy, or (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may be posted on GoDaddy's website or contained in GoDaddy's promotional materials.</p>
<strong>
<strong>5.
UP TO DATE INFORMATION.
USE OF INFORMATION AND EXPIRATION</strong>
</strong>
<p>You agree to notify GoDaddy within five (5) business days when any of the information you provided as part of the application and/or registration process changes.
It is your responsibility to keep this information in a current and accurate status.
Failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide GoDaddy with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis, shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.
Failure by you, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by GoDaddy to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall also be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.
You agree to retain a copy for your record of the receipt for purchase of your domain name.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You agree that for each domain name registered by you, the following contact data is required: postal address, email address, telephone number, and if available, a facsimile number for the Registered Name Holder and, if different from the Registered Name Holder, the same contact information for, a technical contact, an administrative contact and a billing contact.<br>
<br>
You acknowledge and agree that domain name registration requires that your contact information, in whole or in part, be shared with the registry operator, for their use, copying, distribution, publication, modification and other processing for the purpose of administration of the domain name registration, which may require such information be transferred back and forth across international borders, to and from the U.S.
to the EU, for example.
As required by ICANN or for certain ccTLDs (.am, .com.au, .net.au, .org.au, .ca, .cz, .fr, .it, .jp, .co.jp, .kr, .co.kr, .ne.kr, .re.kr, .no, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .vg, .se, .so, .sg, .com.sg, .tw, .com.tw, .net.tw, .org.tw, .uk, .co.uk, .me.uk, .org.uk, .us), this information may be made publicly available by the registry operator via Whois or its successor protocol (collectively referred to as the “Whois" Directory) that is beyond, and not subject to, GoDaddy's control.</p>
<p>Both GoDaddy and the registry operator may be required to archive this information with a third-party escrow service.
You hereby consent and give permission for all such requirements and disclosures.
Further, you represent and warrant that, if you are providing information about a third party, you have notified the third party of the disclosure and the purpose for the disclosure and you have obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure.
Registrar will not process data in a way that is incompatible with this Agreement.
Registrar will take reasonable precautions to protect data from loss or misuse.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You agree that for each domain name registered by you the following information could be made publicly available in the Whois Directory as determined by ICANN or registry policies and may be sold in bulk as set forth in the ICANN agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>The domain name;</li>
<li>Your name and postal address;</li>
<li>The name, email address, postal address, voice and fax numbers for technical and administrative contacts;</li>
<li>The Internet protocol numbers for the primary and secondary name servers;</li>
<li>The corresponding names of the name servers.
and</li>
<li>The original date of registration and expiration date,</li>
<li>Name of primary name server and secondary name server,</li>

</ul>
<p>You agree that, to the extent permitted by ICANN, GoDaddy may make use of the publicly available information you provided during the registration process.
If you engage in the reselling of domain names you agree to provide any individuals whose personal information you've obtained, information about the possible uses of their personal information pursuant to ICANN policy.
You also agree to obtain consent, and evidence of consent, from those individuals for such use of the personal information they provide.</p>

DEFAULT SETTINGS.
PARKED PAGE</strong>
</strong>
<p>
<u>Choosing Your Domain Name Settings.</u> When you register a domain name with GoDaddy, you will be prompted to choose your domain name settings during the checkout process.
If you plan on using another provider for your website or hosting needs, then you should enter the name servers of such provider when you choose your domain name settings.
This will direct your domain name away from GoDaddy’s name servers.
If you are an existing GoDaddy customer and have already set up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for new domain name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again during the checkout process.
</p>
<p>
<u>GoDaddy’s Default Settings.</u> If you do not direct your domain name away from GoDaddy’s name servers as described above, GoDaddy will direct your domain name to a “<u>Parked Page</u>” (“<u>Default Setting</u>”).
You acknowledge and agree that GoDaddy has the right to set the Default Setting.
</p>
<p>
<u>Parked Page Default Setting.</u> GoDaddy's Parked Page service is an online domain monetization system designed to generate revenue (through the use of pay per click advertising) from domain names that are not actively being used as websites.
If your domain name is directed to a Parked Page, you acknowledge and agree that GoDaddy may display both (a) in-house advertising (which includes links to GoDaddy products and services) and (b) third-party advertising (which includes links to third-party products and services) on your Parked Page through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video streams, or any other advertising means, and we may aggregate for our own use, related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means.
In addition, you acknowledge and agree that all in-house and third-party advertising will be selected by GoDaddy and its advertising partners, as appropriate, and you will not be permitted to customize the advertising, or entitled to any compensation in exchange therefor.
Please note that the third-party advertising displayed on GoDaddy’s Parked Pages may contain content offensive to you, including but not limited to links to adult content.
GoDaddy makes no effort to edit, control, monitor, or restrict the content and third-party advertising displayed on GoDaddy’s Parked Pages, and expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility to you or any third party in connection therewith.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<u>Changing GoDaddy’s Default Settings.</u> You may change GoDaddy’s Default Settings at any time during the term of your domain name registration.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<u>Content Displaying On Your Parked Page.</u> You can not modify the content displaying on your Parked Page.
You may select one of the other options listed below.</li>
<li>
<u>Participating In Domain Name Monetization.</u> If you wish to participate in the domain monetization potential presented by GoDaddy’s Parked Page service, please review and consider purchasing our CashParking® service.</li>
<li>
<u>No Content.</u> If the options listed above are not acceptable to you, please contact customer support to learn what other options might be available to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<u>Return To Parked Page Default Setting Upon Domain Name Expiration.</u> Upon domain name expiration, and regardless of how you use your domain name during the term of your domain name registration, your domain name will automatically return to the Parked Page Default Setting described above.
As used in this paragraph, “expiration” is deemed to include any “renewal period” or “redemption period” immediately after the domain name expires, but before the domain name is returned to the registry.
Once your domain name has returned to the Parked Page Default Setting described above, the only way to opt out of the Parked Page service is to renew, redeem, or re-register your domain name in accordance with Section 2(B), Domain Name Renewal Terms, of this Agreement.</p>

The service may only be used on domain names that have not passed their expiration date.
In order to change the expiration date again, You will be required to renew the domain name first.

<strong>Backordering/Monitoring.</strong> You agree a domain name that has expired shall be subject first to a grace period of twelve (12) days, followed by the ICANN-mandated redemption grace period of thirty (30) days.
During this period of time, the current domain name registrant may renew the domain name and retain registration rights.
We do not guarantee your backorder will result in you obtaining the domain name and expressly reserves the right to (a) refuse additional backorders or (b) cancel existing backorders at any time for any reason.
If your backorder is refused or cancelled, we agree to promptly refund any fees paid for such domain name backorder.
The domain name may also be placed in a secondary market for resale through the Auctions® service.
After your first year of Auctions membership, you agree that unless otherwise advised, we will automatically renew your Auctions membership using the payment method you have on file for so long as your backorder credit is active.
You may learn more about Auctions by visiting the Auctions website.
The domain name may also be subject to a drop pool process before it is available for purchasing.
You understand we and our registrar affiliates use our services, including backordering.
Therefore, the domain name may be registered with a different registrar, but can be managed through your account.
By using the Services, you will be able to, among other things: </p>
<ol>
<li>Backorder any domain name under the top level domains .COM, .NET, .US, .BIZ, .INFO, .ORG, .MOBI.

<li>Select domain names off the expiring domain name list you would like to register.
Each domain name you attempt to backorder will include the price of up to a one-year domain name registration, as set forth in subsection (i) above.</li>

Domain Ownership Protection generally allows You to: (i) prevent accidental loss of a domain name due to an expired credit card or invalid payment method for a period of ninety (90) days before the domain goes through its normal expiration process.
and (ii) lock your domain name to your account.
</p>
<p>THE SERVICE WILL NOT, HOWEVER, PREVENT TRANSFERS RESULTING FROM YOUR ACTION OF LISTING YOUR DOMAIN FOR SALE ON ANY OF GoDaddy'S PLATFORMS, INCLUDING PREMIUM LISTINGS, REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU PURCHASED THE SERVICE.
</p>
<p>Once you have elected to purchase the Service for any and all domain names, the automatic renewal function will be activated for each domain name and those names will not be transferable until You elect to remove the service or sell the domain as mentioned above.
Accordingly, You acknowledge and agree You have carefully considered the implications accompanying the purchase of the Service and understand the restrictions the Service will place upon Your ability to transfer any domains for which You have purchased the Service.

As a result, GoDaddy does not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of many of the domain names.
Domain names listed may be withdrawn at any time by the seller or by us.
You acknowledge and agree that your transaction will be handled by GoDaddy's “Transaction Assurance” process.
By using GoDaddy's “Transaction Assurance” process, you authorize GoDaddy to perform tasks on your behalf in order to complete the transaction.

GoDaddy will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose.
You acknowledge GoDaddy is not a bank and the service is a payment processing service rather than a banking service.
You further acknowledge GoDaddy is not acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow with respect to your funds.
In all transactions, where the domain name is registered to us, domain names purchased through the Service may not be transferred away from us to another registrar for a period of sixty (60) days following the change of registrant date.</p>

<p>
<u>
<em>Remedies</em>

The service credit shall be applied as an extension to the term of the affected Services.
A customer’s Account shall not be credited more than once per month under the Service Uptime Guarantee.

<p>
<small>If your Services include Domain Name System Security Extensions (“<u>DNSSEC</u>”), you will be able to secure your domain names with DNSSEC.
DNSSEC is designed to protect you from forged DNS data so “hackers” cannot direct visitors to your website to a forged site.

<small>DNSSEC works by using public key cryptography.
You acknowledge and agree that if the keys do not match, a visitor’s lookup of your website may fail (and result in a “website not found” error) and we assume no liability or responsibility regarding the same.
In addition, DNSSEC responses are authenticated, but not encrypted.
You acknowledge and agree that DNSSEC does not provide confidentiality of data, and we assume no liability or responsibility regarding the same.</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>We prohibit the running of a public recursive DNS service on any server.
All recursive DNS servers must be secured to allow only internal network access or a limited set of IP addresses.
We actively scan for the presence of public recursive DNS services and reserves the right to remove any servers from the network that violate this restriction.</small>

<br>
<br>
<u>
<em>CIRA Certified Registrar</em>

Each variant registered will incur a registration fee.
In addition, when registering multiple .CA domain (ASCII and IDN) variants in a bundle, your registrant information <strong>
<em>must be identical</em>
</strong>.
If variants are registered at other registrars or if registrant information does not match, it may result in an "unavailable" search result, delayed or failed registration.
If information does not match, validation is required and may take up to seven business days and delay availability of domain.</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>(C) PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO .CN REGISTRATIONS</em>
</strong>
<br>
.CN is a restricted TLD – applications are subject to both a domain name check <strong>
<em>and</em>
</strong> real name verification as required by the People’s Republic of China.
Registrations in .CN are therefore subject to the following additional terms:</p>
<p>
<u>
<em>Verification, Registration and Activation</em>
</u>.
If a domain name is not permitted to be registered by the Chinese government, as determined by us, the Registry Operator and/or a 3rd party provider utilized for such services and determinations, in either party’s discretion, the application for registration will not be successful.
In such event, the name will be deleted and you will be eligible for a refund as further described below.</p>
<p>If permitted, then the Registration may proceed, but a .CN domain name may not be activated (i.e., it will not resolve in the Internet) <u>
<em>unless and until</em>
</u> you have submitted (via the process described during registration) valid documents required of us and the Registry to perform real name verification.
The following are acceptable forms of documents for the purpose of verification:
</p>
<ul>
<li>China: Resident ID, temporary resident ID, business license or organization code certificate</li>
<li>Hong Kong/Macau: Resident ID, driver’s license, passport or business license</li>
<li>Singapore: Driver’s license, passport or business license</li>
<li>Taiwan: Resident ID, driver’s license or business license</li>
<li>Other Countries/Regions: Driver’s license or passport</li>
</ul>
<p>Documents submitted to us are used by us and shared with the Registry solely for the purpose of real name verification, and are otherwise subject to our Privacy Policy.
By registering a .CN domain, you expressly agree that your data may be stored on servers in the U.S., or otherwise outside of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>
<u>
<em>Refunds</em>
</u>.
Refunds for .CN Registrations will only be allowed where (i) registration of the applied for domain name is not permitted by the Chinese government.
or (ii) you notify us of your intent to cancel for any reason within the first five (5) days after the Registration (i.e., after it is deemed permissible by the Chinese government).
For the avoidance of doubt, refunds will not be permitted under any circumstances after five (5) days from the date of Registration, including, for example, in the event real name verification is not successful or if the Chinese government determines after Registration that the domain name should not have been registered (and directs us to delete).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(D) PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO .JP REGISTRATIONS</em>
</strong>
<br>
<u>
<em>Registration Restrictions</em>
