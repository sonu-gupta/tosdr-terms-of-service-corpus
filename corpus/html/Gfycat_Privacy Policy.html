Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request.
Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.</p>
<p>Although Gfycat makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Gfycat is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary.

To protect your privacy, Gfycat will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p>
