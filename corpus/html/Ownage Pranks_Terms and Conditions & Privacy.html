<br>
END USER LICENSE
<p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, OP Media grants you a limited nonexclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable license to download and install a copy of the App on a mobile device and to run such copy of the App solely for your own personal, noncommercial purposes.
This license does not give you any title or ownership in the Service, or OP Media’s scripts.
This license should not be construed as a sale or transfer of any intellectual property rights to the App, Service or scripts.&nbsp;OP Media reserves all rights in and to the Service and all of its related content not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.</p>
<p>The grant of this license is not, and shall not be construed as, a grant of any right to you to use, receive or view, copies of source code, schematics, master copies, design materials related to the App.&nbsp.
Without limiting the foregoing, you shall have no rights to receive any source code for the App and shall not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source code for the App for any purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
NOTICES TO USERS: RECORDING OTHERS USING THE APP MAY BE ILLEGAL IN YOUR STATE OR COUNTRY
<p>This Service offers a feature enabling users to record others during a call.
Depending on the state or country in which you are located <strong>
<u>or</u>
</strong> the person you are calling is located,&nbsp;you may violate a state’s&nbsp;or country’s law by listening in on or recording a telephone conversation without informing them.
You may not—and represent and warrant you have/will not—use the recording capability of the Service unless you have determined that your use is legal each time you use the feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before recording any call, you must check the laws of your state and the laws of any state in which a person you are calling is located in order to determine if you need the other party's permission to record a call.
Even if your state only requires the permission of one party, you should be aware that it is possible to make calls to or receive calls from people located in states that require the permission of both parties to record a call.
If you record such a call without the knowledge and permission of the other person, you may be subject to criminal prosecution in the other state.</p>
<p>You must also confirm that phone number you are calling is not on the national “Do Not Call” registry or any similar “do not call” list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
CERTAIN NUMBERS ARE FULLY RESTRICTED FROM CALLING
<p>You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call emergency lines, health care facilities, government agencies, employees or officials, law enforcement, schools, numbers assigned to radio common carrier services, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call.
Calling one of these entities shall result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and may possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
YOU MAY CALL ONLY PEOPLE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY
<p>You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call anyone you have not had a personal interaction with.
Although the scripts are often cartoonish and often outlandish, some of the scripts may be scary or misleading to people who may not be expecting these calls or who cannot get a personal, friendly explanation about the nature of the call.
We’ve therefore chosen to require you to call only to people who you know personally and by using the Services you represent and warrant that you will adhere to this restriction.
Calling strangers can result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and would possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
YOU GRANT PERMISSION FOR US TO CALL YOU AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE PEOPLE YOU CALL
<p>By registering your number through the App, you grant us permission to call the phone number you provided at registration.
You represent and warrant that any numbers you have called using the App meet the guidelines of this Agreement and assent to us calling or following up with any of those phone numbers you have called using the App.</p>
<p>We may choose contact you to audit a call you have made or contact a person you have called to ensure that your use of the Services complies with this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
THIS APP CANNOT BE USED FOR AUTODIALING AND ROBOCALLS
<p>We take telecommunications regulations very seriously and have call limits, manual dialing restrictions, and other limitations in place to prevent the Services being used as an auto-dialer or a robocalling platform.
Any attempts to use the Services in an automated nature shall result in immediate termination of your account and may result in civil or criminal penalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
THIS APP USES CELEBRITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL IMPERSONATORS
<p>Certain scripts available through the Service are voiced by celebrity impersonators or may seem to impersonate real organizations.
This Service is not affiliated with, maintained, authorized, endorsed or sponsored by any of the impersonated celebrities or any of their affiliates.
You may not post or share Content suggesting that an impersonated celebrity or organization is, in fact, the real celebrity or organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
TERMS RELATED TO TELESWAP PARTINERSHIP
<p>The Service, through a partnership with Teleswap, may allow users to make calls via an obfuscated number (the “Feature”).
This Feature is governed by all the terms in this Agreement as well as these additional terms in this section.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have not and will not use this Feature for commercial purposes.
Using the Feature in connection with telemarketing or debt-collection, for example, may be a violation of the law as well as a violation of these terms.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may not use the Services to commit fraud or make misrepresentations even if those misrepresentations do not arise to the level of a legal violation.
This feature should currently only be used to call phone numbers in the United States.
The FTC governs fraudulent activity related to callers disguising their identity: should a user use the Feature to engage in fraud, the Service reserves the right to use the data it retains from the Feature to assist in any investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN PROCEDURE FOR COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS
<p>It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
This page describes the information that should be present in these notices.
It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to OP Media as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify.
The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S.
Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.<br>
<br>It is expected that all users of any part of OP Media will comply with applicable copyright laws.
However, if OP Media receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.<br>
<br>If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA.
We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.</p>

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

<p>Unless you and OP Media decide otherwise, mediation or arbitration will be conducted in Arlington, VA or Los Angeles, CA unless objectively, unduly burdensome to one party.
Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative and third-party fees.
The award rendered by the mediator or arbitrator shall include costs of mediation/arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the mediator or arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
For avoidance of doubt, if there are one or more disputed items that remain unresolved at the end of the mediation, the mediator will render a final and binding decision on those unresolved items.
The mediator's decisions shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Without limitation, costs include attorney’s fees required to enforce the mediator’s decision.
&nbsp;Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from the courts for matters related unauthorized access to the Service.</p>
