<ul>

<li>Praise or glorify violence against individuals or groups based on the attributes noted above.</li>
<li>Use of racial, religious or other slurs and stereotypes that incite or promote hatred based on any of the attributes noted above.&nbsp;This can take the form of speech, text, or imagery promoting these stereotypes or treating them as factual.</li>
<li>Claim that individuals or groups are physically or mentally inferior, deficient, or diseased based on any of the attributes noted above.
This includes statements that one group is less than another, calling them less intelligent, less capable, or damaged.</li>

<li>Music videos promoting hateful supremacism in the lyrics, metadata, or imagery.</li>
</ul> Educational content <p>We may allow content that includes hate speech if the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic in nature.
This is not a free pass to promote hate speech.
Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A documentary about a hate group:</strong> Educational content that isn’t supporting the group or promoting ideas would be allowed.
A documentary promoting violence or hatred wouldn’t be allowed.</li>
<li>
<strong>A documentary about the scientific study of humans:</strong> A documentary about how theories have changed over time, even if it includes theories about the inferiority or superiority of specific groups, would be allowed because it’s educational.
We won’t allow a documentary claiming there's&nbsp;scientific evidence today that an individual or group is inferior or subhuman.</li>
<li>Historical footage of an event, like WWII, which doesn't&nbsp;promote violence or hatred.</li>
</ul>
<p>This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.
For educational content that includes hate speech, this context must appear in the images or audio of the video itself.
Providing it in the title or description is insufficient.</p> Monetization and other penalties&nbsp.

<li>Repeatedly targets, insults and abuses a group based on the attributes noted above across multiple uploads.</li>
<li>Exposes a group with attributes noted above to risks of physical harm based on the local social or political context.</li>
<li>Creates content that harms the YouTube ecosystem by persistently inciting hostility against&nbsp.
a group with attributes noted above for personal financial gain.</li>
</ul> Examples <p>Here are examples of hate speech not allowed on YouTube.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m glad this [violent event] happened.
