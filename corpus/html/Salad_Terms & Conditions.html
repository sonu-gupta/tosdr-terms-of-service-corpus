<p>
<strong>Dispute Resolution.
&nbsp;PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND SALAD TECH HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.&nbsp.
</strong>You and Salad Tech agree that any claim or dispute that has or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section.</p>
<ol>
<li>We strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution of any dispute or claim by emailing support@salad.com.
&nbsp;You and Salad Tech agree that any and all disputes or claims that have or may arise between you and Salad Tech shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.
Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in New York County, New York if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.<br>‍</li>
<li>The arbitration will be conducted on a confidential basis pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.
The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.
Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.
Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by the court.<br>‍</li>
<li>You and Salad Tech must abide by the following rules: <br>‍<br>1.
ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE &nbsp.
PROCEEDING;<br>2.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF;<br>3.
the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law;<br>4.
the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award;<br>5.
the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law.
and<br>6.
each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instances, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by applicable law.<br>‍</li>
<li>If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in state or federal court in New York County, New York.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall be deemed as preventing Salad Tech from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.<br>‍</li>
<li>
<strong>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out.&nbsp.
</strong>Notwithstanding the above, you or Salad Tech may choose to pursue a claim or dispute in court and not by arbitration if:<br>

the claim or dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court.
or<br>2.

You may opt out by emailing a written notification to Salad Tech at support@salad.com.
Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Salad Tech through arbitration.
Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Salad Tech.&nbsp;<strong> Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your claim or dispute in arbitration or small claims court.<br>‍</strong>
</li>
<li>Jury Waiver.
You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Salad Tech are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.
