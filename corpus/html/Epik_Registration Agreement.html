This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Your use of Epik.com's Domain Name Registration and represents the entire agreement between You and Epik.com.
By participating in this transaction, You acknowledge that You have read, understand and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including our dispute policy and the ICANN Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy along with any new, different or additional terms, conditions or policies, including the Universal Terms of Service which Epik.com may establish from time to time.
Such Agreements may be found here.</p>
<p>In addition to transactions entered into by You on Your behalf, You also agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement for transactions entered into on Your behalf by anyone acting as Your Agent, and transactions entered into by anyone who uses the account You've established with Epik.com, whether or not the transactions were in Your behalf.
You acknowledge that Epik.com's acceptance of any application made by You for services provided by Epik.com will take place at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") accredited registrar's offices located in Bellevue, Washington, USA.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Epik.com is a registrar bound by an agreement between Epik.com and ICANN.
You agree that Epik.com may modify this agreement in order to comply with applicable law and the terms and conditions set forth by the ICANN and/or the Registry Administrator chosen by ICANN, as well as any registration rules or policies that may be published from time to time by Epik.com .</p>
1.
fees
<p>In consideration for the services and products ("service") purchased by You and provided to You by Epik.com, You agree to pay Epik.com at the time service is provided.
Payment is to be made by You by providing one of the following: a valid credit card, an online check, eCheck, Epik.com In-store credit.
Personal checks and money orders must be for payments of $100 or more, and issued in U.S.
dollars for the full amount required at that time.
All money orders will be delayed by up to ten (10) days until the money is credited, which may delay Your usage of the product or service, and any money order that does not clear will result in a $25 processing fee.
Personal checks under $1,000 are subject to the same processing fees as wire transfers.
All personal checks will be delayed up to fourteen (14) days until the money is credited, which may delay Your usage of the product or service, and any check that bounces will result in a $25 bounced check fee.
If You purchase an automatically renewing service or product by personal check, it is Your responsibility to make payment arrangements for each renewal payment.
You understand that ICANN requires Epik.com to collect a small registration fee when You purchase Your domain name registration.
You agree to pay such fees.
Payments are non-refundable.
If for any reason Epik.com is unable to charge Your Payment Method for the full amount owed Epik.com for the service provided, or if Epik.com is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to Your Payment Method, You agree that Epik.com may pursue all available remedies in order to obtain payment.
You agree that among the remedies Epik.com may pursue in order to effect payment, shall include but will not be limited to, immediate cancellation without notice to You of any domain names registered or renewed on Your behalf.
Epik.com reserves the right to charge a reasonable service fee for administrative tasks outside the scope of its regular services.
These include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that cannot be handled over email but require personal service, and disputes that require legal services.
These charges will be billed to the Payment Method we have on file for You.
You may change Your Payment Method at any time by logging into Your Account Manager and selecting Credit Card and Payment Information.</p>
<p>A table of Epik fees can be found here: https://registrar.epik.com/prices/</p> Domain Name Renewals
<p>When You register a domain name, automatic renewal may be set as the default setting, which You must deactivate if You do not want Your domain name(s) to be automatically renewed.
Unless You disable the automatic renewal option, Epik.com will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of Your original registration, any domain name that is up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method You have on file with Epik.com, at Epik.com's then current rates.
Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one year, Epik.com may automatically renew it for one year.
If You have chosen to register Your domain name for two years, Epik.com will automatically renew it for two years, and so on.
Domain name renewals will be non refundable.
If for any reason Epik.com is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method You have on file, and You fail to respond to our notices, Your domain name registration will expire.
It is Your responsibility to keep Your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.
If You do not elect that the domain name be automatically renewed, You have the responsibility of logging into the Domain Manager portion of your Account Manager for that domain name and manually implementing the renewal by the expiration date (should You in fact want the domain name to be renewed).
In this case, if You fail to manually implement the renewal in a timely fashion the domain name will be cancelled and You will no longer have use of that name.
You agree that Epik.com will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that You fail to renew, either automatically or manually.
In any case, if You fail to renew Your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply.
If You signed up for domain masking, domain forwarding, or any other similar service, with Your domain registration, these services will be automatically continue when Your domain registration is up for renewal, and You will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless You cancel in advance.</p>
<p>If You fail to renew Your domain name, You agree that Epik.com may, at its sole discretion, renew Your expired domain name on Your behalf.
If Epik.com decides to renew Your expired domain name on Your behalf, You may be eligible for a Renewal Grace Period during which time You may reimburse Epik.com for the renewal and keep Your domain name.
If You do not renew in time Your domain name may be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which You may have up to 30 days of redemption period during which You may, if eligible pay Epik.com a Redemption fee and redeem Your domain name.
The Redemption fee is currently $90 USD and is subject to change under the terms of Section 2 of this agreement.
If You do not redeem Your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period Epik.com may, at its sole discretion, delete Your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on Your behalf.</p>
<p>If You do not redeem Your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release Your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.
Please note that Renewal Grace Periods and Redemption Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs.
Please refer to the specific terms for the applicable TLD.
In the event of a conflict between this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.</p>
