<p>
<b>What are cookies?</b>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a text file containing a unique identifier which is downloaded to your device when you access a website or mobile app.
The text file is then sent back to our server each time your browser requests a page from the server.
This enables us to operate the Website or mobile app more effectively so that it reflects your personal preferences, based on your previous browsing on the Website or mobile app as well as keywords we may be able to gather from URLs of other webpages or apps from which you accessed the Website or mobile app.
Cookies can also allow us to do various other things, as explained below.</p>
<p>Cookies can be used for the duration of your visit or they can be set to last longer so we can measure how you interact with us over time.</p>
<p>Cookies help us to provide you with important features and functionality, and to ensure you get great customer service.
We also use cookies to keep our business secure by detecting fraudulent activity and to help prevent security breaches <b>What cookies do we use?</b>
</p>
<p>When you visit the Website or mobile app and consent to cookies, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:
</p>
<p>
<b>Strictly Necessary Cookies</b>
</p>
<p>These are cookies that are required for the administration and operation of the Website or mobile app.
Some cookies that we use are necessary for the Website or mobile app to function properly and to enable you to move around the Website or mobile app and use its features.</p>
<p>
<b>Functional Cookies (Useful Features)</b>
</p>
<p>We may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made on the Website or mobile app so as to provide you with a more enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.
We may also use cookies to embed certain social posts on the Website or mobile app.</p>
<p>
<b>Analytical and Performance Cookies (Visit Tracking)</b>
</p>
<p>We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting.
Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of the Website or mobile app by using cookies.
They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the Website or mobile app, how long they stay and how visitors move around the Website when they are using it.
This helps us to improve the way the Website or mobile app works, for example, it helps users to find what they are looking for easily.
The information generated relating to the Website or mobile app may be used to create reports about the use of the site and the analytics service provider will store this information.</p>
<p>
<b>Third party and Advertising Cookies</b>
</p>
<p>These cookies record your visit to the Website or mobile app, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other sites or apps.
We will use this information to try and make the Website and mobile app (and other sites or apps that you visit) more relevant to your interests.
We may also share this information with others, such as other Virgin entities and carefully selected third parties, for this purpose.
We work with technology partners to support the Website and mobile app and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services of other Virgin entities and partners associated with Virgin Red both on the Website or mobile app and on affiliated sites an apps or sites and apps within the advertising networks we work with.
We may use cookies on the Website to help us to place relevant advertising on third party websites when you visit those sites.
Placing advertising on third party sites helps us to fund the best offers for the Virgin Red programme.
If you are not happy for us to do this, please see the section of this policy titled “How do I turn cookies off?” below.</p>
<p>
<b>Do we use any third-party cookies?</b>
</p>
<p>Because the Virgin Group and Richard Branson have a strong presence on various social networks, we try to make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks.
We add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks.
When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies.
They can't read any cookies we set from the Website, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of the Website (and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site).
</p>
<p>Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control.
These cookies are likely to be analytical and performance cookies or advertising and targeting cookies and we use these to improve your experience on the Website.</p>
