<b>PREAMBLE</b>
<br>
viagogo Entertainment Inc, which is registered in Delaware, United States of America, offers a service on its Internet site at the address www.viagogo.com (hereafter, the “Viagogo Platform”) that brings together sellers (the “Sellers”) of tickets for shows or sporting events (the “Tickets”) and buyers (the “Buyers”) for these same Tickets.
The Sellers and the Buyers are hereafter jointly referred to as the Members.
The Viagogo Platform allows contracts for the sale of Tickets to be concluded.
However, the Members are the sole decision-makers in finalising the sale or purchase of the Tickets.
The Members’ acceptance of these General Terms of Use of the Viagogo Platform allows you (“You”) to access the Viagogo Platform that serves to bring together Sellers and Buyers and to make transactions on the www.viagogo.com site according to the terms defined below.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.1 Introduction.</b> Welcome to viagogo's online ticket exchange (the "Site").
These Terms and Conditions (including any documents referred to in it) ("Agreement") list the terms of the agreement between you and viagogo Entertainment Inc ("viagogo" or "We" or "Us") for the buying and selling of tickets ("Tickets"), and all other services that We provide (the "Services").
By using our Site, You agree to accept this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.2 Ticketing Exchange.</b> viagogo provides a service that allows members who want to buy tickets ("Buyers") to find members who want to sell tickets ("Sellers").
viagogo does not take title to the underlying ticket and the actual transactions are between the Buyers and Sellers.
Once Buyer and Seller have entered into a transaction, all transactions are covered by the viagogo Guarantee.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.3 viagogo Guarantee.</b> When You purchase tickets on viagogo, viagogo guarantees that You will receive the tickets You paid for in time for the event.
In the rare instance that a problem arises and the original ticket Seller does not provide You with the tickets listed for sale, viagogo will, in its sole and absolute discretion, review comparably priced tickets and offer You replacement tickets at no additional cost, or viagogo will issue You a refund for the cost of the tickets.
"Comparably priced" replacement tickets are determined by viagogo in its sole and absolute discretion.
When You sell tickets on viagogo, provided you provide the exact tickets listed for sale and the ticket Buyer successfully gains entry to the event, viagogo guarantees that you will be paid for your sale.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.4 Modification.</b> If We change this Agreement, We shall post a revised version of this Agreement, which shall automatically replace the terms of this Agreement.
The revised version of this Agreement is automatically effective after it is initially posted on the Site.
Your continued use of the Site and the Services following viagogo's posting of a revised Agreement will constitute Your acceptance of the revised Agreement.
If You do not agree with the terms of this Agreement or any revised version of this Agreement, do not continue to use the Services or this Site.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>2.1 Requirements.</b> To be a member of this Site, You must agree to accept the terms in this Agreement.
You may only use the Services if You can legally enter into and form binding contracts.
If You do not qualify, do not use the Services.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.2 Registration.</b> We will not allow You to buy or sell tickets before You have registered with Us.
To register, You must provide your real name, address, phone number, and email address.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.3 Username and Password.</b> You will need a username and password to access the Site and use the Services.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your username and password and You are responsible for any action taken under your username or password.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.4 Listing.</b> To sell tickets, a Seller lists the tickets in the Site database.
As part of the listing process, the Seller assigns a price to the tickets and provides information including but not limited to the event, date, section, seat, and row, and sale end date, all in accordance with the process outlined in the help pages.
When listing seated tickets, all tickets in the same listing must be consecutive seats.
If tickets are not consecutive, then the Seller must create a separate listing.
If a Seller sends tickets that are not consecutive, but listed them as so, viagogo may charge the seller a replacement fee and other charges, as specified in Section 5.
“Piggyback” tickets may not be sold in the same listing.
“Piggyback” tickets are for seats that are directly behind each other.To list as a Seller, You must provide a valid credit or debit card.
You also grant Us a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, paid-up, royalty-free right and license to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish and display on the Site and on the sites of our marketing partners your descriptions of tickets listed for sale.
This is so we can promote the sale of tickets and items that You list for sale.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.5 Tax on Seller Proceeds.</b> The Seller is responsible for determining whether it/he/she is required to account for VAT (UK or other), GST, sales tax or other similar fees (collectively, “Tax”) on the sale of the ticket.
We take no responsibility for such issues.
If the Seller is required to account for Tax on the sale of the ticket, the Seller should include the Tax (i.e., total) when setting ticket prices on the website.
Note that this is separate from any Tax viagogo is required to charge on its fees.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.6 Making an Offer.</b> A member who wants to buy a ticket first scans the Site database for tickets listed by Sellers that match the Buyer's desired tickets.
Once the Buyer finds a matching ticket, the Buyer notifies Us with an "offer" that the Buyer is willing to purchase the ticket.
Note that the Seller may or may not be required to charge you Tax on the sale of your ticket.
Thus, the ticket price shown (before our fees) may include Tax as appropriate.
Please note this does not include any Tax that may be payable on fees We are required to pay.
As a Buyer, You grant Us permission to charge your credit card, debit card, PayPal account, or bank account for the purchase of the selected tickets.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.7 Payment Authorisation.</b> When We receive an offer by credit or debit card, We obtain an authorisation from the Buyer's credit or debit card equal to the price, booking fees and delivery fees for the tickets.
We will also add Tax on our fees as applicable.
The authorisation will remain on the Buyer's credit or debit card until the sale is completed or the order is cancelled.
When We receive an offer by PayPal, We will obtain an authorisation from the Buyer's PayPal account equal to the price, booking fees and delivery fees for the tickets.
We will also add Tax on our fees as applicable.
When We receive an offer by bank transfer, We will check to see if the bank account is valid.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.8 Notification.</b> Once We obtain an authorisation from the Buyer, We notify the Seller of the sale via email and/or telephone, and We confirm to the Seller that the Buyer is willing to pay the listed price, booking fees, delivery fees, and taxes on our fees.
Please note, selling prices for tickets traded on viagogo may differ from their original ‘face value’ (i.e.
the price it is sold for on the primary market).
Additional information can be found in our FAQ’s and on the ticket details pages.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.9 Seller's Confirmation Obligation.</b> Except as noted in Section 2.9 a), the Seller must confirm the order within forty eight (48) hours of the sale of the tickets.
Sellers should use our automated online confirmation process.
Sellers will be able to see the service fee and taxes on our fees before completing the sell process and committing to sell their tickets.
Sellers have forty-eight (48) hours from the time of sale of the tickets to “Report a Problem” if they are unable to deliver the exact tickets listed for sale.
Sellers can “Report a Problem” using the “Report a Problem” link on the online confirmation page.
In the case a Seller has not confirmed a sale within forty eight (48) hours, or in the case a Seller “Reports a Problem” the Seller, including without limitation, may be subject to a replacement fee, other charges, and/or other consequences as specified in Section 5.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.9 a) Exception to Seller’s Obligation to Confirm.</b> Sellers who commit to send tickets directly to viagogo are not required to confirm the order.
Such sellers have no right to “Report a Problem” and the order is automatically confirmed immediately after the sale.
If the listed ticket is not delivered, viagogo shall have the right to charge the Seller a replacement fee and other charges, as specified in Section 5.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.10 Collecting Payment.</b> Typically, upon the Buyer completing the transaction, We collect payment from the Buyer for the listed price, booking fees, delivery fees, and taxes on our fees.
In the case where multiple different Buyers are sharing the cost of a transaction and each paying part of the total amount (i.e.
a ‘Split Payment’ transaction), we collect the payments within 24 hours of the first Buyer completing the transaction.
At no time do We provide the Buyer's payment information to the Seller.
The money is paid to us, and the Seller is compensated for the sale according to their selected payment method and the payment policy in the help pages.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.11 Ticket Fulfillment.
</b>Once the Seller lists tickets for sale, the Buyer purchases these tickets, and the Seller has confirmed the sale, the Seller is responsible for completing the transaction with the exact tickets the Seller has listed.
Tickets sales must be fulfilled via the delivery method indicated at the time of sale directly to the Buyer and no later than the shipping deadline communicated to the seller at the time of sale (“Must Ship By Date”).
<br>
<br> If the Seller lists tickets for sale, confirms the sale and then is unable to deliver the exact tickets listed, viagogo reserves the right to cancel the Seller’s sale, find replacement tickets for the Buyer and the Sellers may be subject to a replacement fee, other charges, and/or other consequences, as specified in Section 5.
Invalid tickets: If buyers are refused entry to the venue as a result of invalid tickets we may refund the buyer at any time.
Invalid tickets are defined as anything where buyers are refused entry.
We will collect proof where this is possible but in some cases viagogo reserves the right to refund the buyer and not pay the seller even if proof of non entry is not presented.
In the event that an event is cancelled or re-scheduled, viagogo reserves the right to cancel a seller’s transaction.
If for any reason your tickets are returned to Us or cannot be delivered We will attempt redelivery up to a maximum of three times.
We endeavour to rearrange delivery with the customer or arrange a collection point.
If this is also unsuccessful We will not offer a refund.
We attempt to ensure all tickets are delivered in time for the event, time scale permitting We may require a venue or box office collection (‘pick-up’).
</p>
<p>
<b>2.12 Seller Payment.</b> The Seller will be paid 5-8 working days after the event if delivery of the tickets was successful to the buyer.
We have the right to withhold payment or collect repayment if the event was re-scheduled or cancelled or if We have a good faith basis to believe such sales were unlawful or otherwise made in material violation of this agreement.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.13 Ticket Information.</b> Event dates, times, venues and subject matter, which are listed on the ticket, may change.
It is up to the Buyer to verify the most recent changes by contacting the box office or referring to official listings for any changes.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.14 Substituted Seat Locations.</b> Ticket listings are a representation of actual seat location.
Tickets may be substituted with comparable or better seat locations without the Buyers’ approval.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.15 Claims under the viagogo Guarantee.</b> If You receive tickets from the Seller that are not the tickets you ordered or tickets that are invalid and not honoured at the venue, we strongly advise you to Contact Us to report the issue.
Issues must be reported within 14 days after receiving the tickets otherwise this will no longer be covered by the viagogo Guarantee.
Should you experience problems with your tickets on the day of the event you must contact viagogo within 48 hours of the incident to report the issue.
In certain circumstances, you may be required to complete a Dispute Claim Form and provide additional information in order to claim a refund.
Forms must be returned to viagogo 5 working days after receiving them, in order to apply for a refund.
viagogo reserves the right to prohibit anyone who brings a fraudulent claim from having further access to our website.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.16 Season Cards.</b> In the event that the Buyer fails to return a Season Card to viagogo within 24 hours of the event concluding, the Buyer agrees that viagogo may charge an additional “failure to return fee” of €200 per season card that is not returned to the payment method that was used to purchase the tickets.
This charge is in addition to the amount originally paid for the tickets.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.18 Merchant Description.</b> A payment to viagogo will appear on the Buyer’s payment method statement as “VIAGOGO EVENT TICKETS”.
</p>
