Any amendment to these Terms must be in writing and signed by Nexstar.
The terms of this Contract apply to the parties hereto and all of their successors or assigns.
If there is any conflict between the terms of the Order and these Terms, the terms of the Order will apply.
If any part of the Contract is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such term shall be excluded from the Contract and the remainder of the Contract will remain enforceable and in effect.</p>
<p>3.
Order and Payment.
Nexstar reserves the right to increase or change the rates in any Order at any time for any Advertisement subject to demand and availability.
In the event Nexstar provides notice of any rate change, Client may terminate this Contract within ten (10) days of receipt of such notice.
Nexstar will bill Client monthly unless otherwise stated in the Order.
The Order invoice shall include the charges to Client for placement of the Advertisement on the Property(ies).
Client must dispute any invoice in writing within 10 days of receipt, and any failure to do so within such 10-day period shall be deemed a waiver by Client of any claim relating to such disputed invoice.
Advertiser and Advertiser’s Agency/Buying Service, jointly and severally, are obligated to pay Nexstar in full within 30 days after receipt without any deduction or right of set-off.
Payment by Advertiser to Advertiser’s Agency/Buying Service does not constitute payment to Nexstar, and failure of Advertiser’s Agency/Buying Service to receive funds from Advertiser does not relieve such Agency/Buying Service of its obligations to timely make all payments due.
Failure to pay in accordance with these terms may result in a monthly service charge of 1.5% (or the maximum amount permitted by law) on all unpaid balances not received within 30 days from receipt of invoice.
Nexstar may terminate any Order if payment of any prior Order has not been timely made.
Nexstar, in its sole discretion, may require payment in full in advance for any Order.
provided all Advertisements for political matters will require payment in full in advance.
Any failure by Client to make payment when due shall render Client liable for all reasonable fees (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Nexstar for the collection of all amounts due and owing by Client.</p>
<p>4.
Placement.
Nexstar will provide Client with the use of commercial inventory on its specified Properties as mutually agreed in the Order to which these Terms are attached.
Nexstar will have sole determination of the placement of all Advertisements within a Program or Page.
Placements are not guaranteed.
Nexstar specifically disclaims (i) any obligation to place Client’s Advertisement at a specific time or place, unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing in the Order, (ii) the scheduling of such Advertisement near competitive products and like advertisers, unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing in the Order and (iii) any overlays appearing on the Advertisement (e.g., EAS notifications, viewer tools, information and actions that a viewer or third party may activate, and the like).
Nexstar does not guarantee ratings for any Advertisement unless specifically set forth in the Order and shall have no obligation to provide Client with ratings information.
Client agrees that placement of any Advertisement in any Program will result in such Advertisement being displayed via multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), virtual (OTT) MVPDs, video-on-demand, mobile applications and all other platforms on which the Program is broadcast.</p>
<p>5.
Television Inventory Preemptions.
From time-to-time, preemptions of advertising may occur in any Program or on any Station for any reason.
Client agrees that Nexstar may replace any preempted Advertisement with a “Makegood” in similar inventory.
Nexstar’s rate cards (which are subject to change) and date of order entry will be the sole determinant of inventory clearance and preemption status (e.g., a grid 5 advertisement entered on May 5 will clear before a grid 5 advertisement entered on May 10.
a grid 4 advertisement regardless of date of entry will clear before all grid 5 advertisements, etc.) In the event Nexstar is unable to provide a Makegood, Nexstar may provide a credit not to exceed the amount paid by Client for such preempted Advertisement.
Such credit shall be Client’s sole remedy for any preemption not made good.</p>
<p>6.
Program Substitutions.
Nexstar makes no representations or guarantees regarding any Program.
In the event Client purchased a specific Program, Nexstar may substitute another Program for any Program purchased by Client if such original Program is no longer available.
Any such replacement Program will be of comparable quality with comparable demographics (as determined by Nexstar in its sole discretion) and/or in the same time period and day as originally ordered.</p>
<p>7.
Digital Impressions.
In the event a digital Order guarantees delivery of a certain number of impressions, Nexstar will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) deliver the impressions in accordance with the delivery obligations set forth in the Order and (ii) deliver the impressions starting with the start date and ending with the end date set forth in the Order.
Because the estimates are forecasts, Nexstar makes no guarantee regarding the levels of impressions for any individual Advertisement.
Unless otherwise provided in the digital Order, (i) Nexstar will maintain impression delivery statistics and Advertiser acknowledges that impression delivery statistics provided by Nexstar are the official and definitive measurements of Nexstar’s performance on any impression delivery obligations provided in an Order, and (ii) no other measurements or usage statistics (including those of Advertiser or any third party) shall be accepted by Nexstar or have any effect on an Order.
In the event the impression obligation set forth in an Order is reached prior to the end of the term of an Order, Nexstar may cease distribution of the Advertisement.
The impression obligation will be deemed reached if at least 90% of the impressions are delivered.
If there is a shortfall in delivery of impressions of more than 10% at the end of any specified period, Nexstar may provide, as Advertiser’s sole remedy, “Makegood” impressions in the same or a comparable manner or class of time, or alternatively Nexstar may provide a credit.</p>
<p>8.
Order Errors.
Unless errors in the Order are brought to Nexstar’s attention within three (3) business days of acceptance, the Contract is deemed accepted as written.
No verbal cancellation or changes to a Contract are permitted.
Broadcast Orders may only be cancelled in writing no later than two weeks prior to each such Advertisement’s Publication Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Client may request revisions to the Publication Dates and/or substitute new creative no later than two weeks prior to each such Advertisement’s Publication Date.
No further changes will be accepted after such date.</p>
<p>9.
Advertisement Standards.
All Advertisements furnished by Client must conform to Nexstar’s standards as well as any advertising and technical guidelines provided by Nexstar to Advertiser.
Client represents and warrants that all Advertisements furnished to Nexstar under this Contract (i) will comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and industry standards, (ii) will contain proper sponsorship identification under the Communications Act and FCC rules, (iii) will comply with applicable rules and policies of the Federal Trade Commission and any other government agencies having jurisdiction, (iv) will be truthful, (iv) will not include any Harmful Code or persistent tracking.

and (vii) comply with all applicable best industry standards in connection with the advertising materials, including but not limited to, those set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance, Interactive Advertising Bureau, Network Advertising Initiative, mobile app store providers and other industry standard third parties, organizations or guidelines including the most recent iOS operating system and Google Play disclosures.
“Harmful Code” means content or other material that contains software viruses, worms, Trojan horses, time bombs, cancelbots, or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents, programs, or programming routines.
Client agrees to furnish advertising substantiation material to Nexstar promptly upon request.</p>
<p>10.
Delivery/Right of Rejection.
Client is responsible for timely furnishing, at Client’s sole cost and expense, all Advertisements to Nexstar by the deadline established.
Nexstar shall not be liable for its inability to deliver or place any Advertisement not timely received and Client will remain liable for payment of the reserved placement.
Nexstar has the right to reject any Advertisement in its sole discretion.
Nexstar will attempt to timely notify Client of such rejection.
In the event Nexstar provides a notice of rejection to Client of any Advertisement, Client is solely responsible for timely providing new creative to Nexstar.
If Client fails to timely furnish an appropriate new Advertisement, Nexstar, in its sole discretion, may schedule promotional or public service announcements in place of Client’s rejected Advertisement with a courtesy identification to Advertiser.
No action by Nexstar under this paragraph will relieve Client of its obligations to make all payments provided for in the Order.
Log time and Advertisement deadlines vary throughout the week and year.
