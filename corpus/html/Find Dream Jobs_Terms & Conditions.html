By accessing and using the Sites, you agree to and accept these Terms &amp.
Conditions, as well as our Privacy Policy and any additional terms, conditions and policies published on our Sites (collectively, the “Agreement”).&nbsp.

<b>Mandatory Arbitration.

Thus, for example, if you provide prior express written consent to be contacted via telemarketing or SMS/text messaging, any claims that you may have regarding any telemarketing or SMS/text messages that you receive are subject to the mandatory arbitration provision.&nbsp.
The mandatory arbitration provision also waives your right to participate in a class action or multi-party arbitration.&nbsp.

We will attempt to resolve the matter to your satisfaction within thirty (30) days of our receipt of a customer support ticket.&nbsp.
We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer during this process.&nbsp.
If we provide you with a final written settlement offer and you don't accept it, if we can't otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, or if you choose to skip this step, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in the county where you live by filing a separate Demand for&nbsp;</p>
<p>An AAA arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute or claims that you may have with us—and our Marketing Partners who are third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration provision—arising out of or related to the Agreement.&nbsp.

If the claim is against us, you will need our mailing address to file online.&nbsp.
To obtain our mailing address, contact us by clicking here.</p>
<p>Either party may submit the dispute for resolution by arbitration at a location reasonably convenient to both parties.&nbsp.
If either party files for arbitration, it will be conducted in accordance with the then current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</p>

For claims brought by you of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.&nbsp.
The arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief, including injunctive relief.&nbsp.
Any award will be final and conclusive to the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp.
