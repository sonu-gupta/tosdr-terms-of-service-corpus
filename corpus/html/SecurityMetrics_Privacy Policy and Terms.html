Introduction
<p>SecurityMetrics, Inc.
is aware of the privacy concerns of its customers.
Our policy for collecting and using personal information is detailed below.</p>
EU-US Privacy Shield &amp.
Swiss-US Privacy Shield
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how SecurityMetrics collects, uses, and discloses certain personally identifiable information that we receive in the US from the European Economic Area (“EEA Personal Data”).</p>
<p>SecurityMetrics recognizes that the EEA has established strict protections regarding the handling of EEA Personal Data, including requirements to provide adequate protection for EEA Personal Data transferred outside of the EEA.
To provide adequate protection for certain EEA Personal Data about Customers received in the US, SecurityMetrics has elected to self-certify to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework administered by the US Department of Commerce (“Privacy Shield”).
SecurityMetrics adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability.</p>
<p>SecurityMetrics also complies with the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from Switzerland.</p>
<p>For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield, SecurityMetrics is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
For more information about the Privacy Shield, see the US Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website located at:&nbsp;https://www.privacyshield.gov.

Information Collected
<p>SecurityMetrics collects information about its Customers from third parties such as acquiring banks, merchant service providers, and independent sales organizations (collectively “MSPs”), with whom the Customer has a contractual relationship and through its website and related eCommerce services at several points.
SecurityMetrics’ website is maintained in the United States of America.
By using SecurityMetrics’ website, you freely and specifically give us your consent to export your personally identifiable information to the USA and store and use it in the USA as specified by this Privacy Policy.
All information collected by SecurityMetrics is provided by the user, which in this case is the Customer.</p>

<li>Credit card data of the Customer may be collected and stored by SecurityMetrics.
This data is stored in accordance with the PCI DSS.</li>
<li>SecurityMetrics also collects data related to a Customer’s data security as requested by the Customer when purchasing the services.
This data includes answers to self-assessment questionnaires, vulnerability scan data, and which security services the Customer purchases.</li>
<li>SecurityMetrics allows Customers to add additional users to a Customer’s account.
Customer agrees that SecurityMetrics may allow an MSP from whom it received Customer’s information to be added as an additional user on a user’s account with rights to make changes to the account.</li>
<li>SecurityMetrics collects information that is not personally identifiable to the user, such as referring URL addresses, time spent in certain areas of SecurityMetrics’ website, actions taken while on SecurityMetrics’ website, and origination of the user.</li>

<ul>
<li>Part of SecurityMetrics services is to report certain Customer compliance with data security standards, and this reporting requires contact information of the Customer.</li>

<li>Reimbursement Limitations.
<p>The PSW is not available to level 1 Merchants, as level 1 Merchants are defined by the card brands.
The PSW is only available to Merchants located in the United States and Canada and that have enrolled in and paid (or whose Acquirer has paid) SecurityMetrics for the Services described in this Terms of Use Agreement or an applicable Statement of Work.
The PSW reimburses a Merchant up to $100,000 (the "PSW Limit") per Merchant identification number (or other mutually agreed upon form of identification,) subject to the terms and limitations described more fully below.
SecurityMetrics will reimburse Merchants only for the following costs and expenses actually incurred as a result of a failure of SecurityMetrics' Services to comply with PCI DSS and HIPAA, and that are timely reported according to Section 5 below by Merchants in connection with a properly reported data breach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Penalties or fines charged to Merchant by Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, or JCB directly or through an Acquirer.

</li>
<li>The Program is Not Insurance.
<p>The PSW is not insurance.
Neither Merchants nor any other entity with which the Merchant has a relationship receives insurance as a result of the PSW or this Terms of Use Agreement.
Neither the Merchant nor any other entity with which the Merchant has a relationship is an "insured" or beneficiary under any insurance policy.
Nothing in PSW or this Terms of Use Agreement creates an insurance relationship between Acquirer or the merchant and AIG (or any other AIG affiliate).
SecurityMetrics is not providing Merchants or any entity with which Merchants have a relationship with insurance pursuant to a contractual agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>The Program Limit.
<p>The PSW Limit is the most any Merchant can recover for each merchant identification number (or other mutually agreed upon form of identification) during a twelve (12) month period for any or all such costs or expenses, combined, and regardless of the number of data security events discovered or regulatory actions taken.</p>
</li>
<li>Notification.
<p>Merchants are required to provide SecurityMetrics notice within thirty (30) days of discovery or suspicious of a breach or compromise.
A Merchant is required to provide SecurityMetrics with any documentation, invoice, or other evidence required by SecurityMetrics within thirty (30) days after receipt of this documentation, invoice, or other evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>Reporting.
<p>The PSW reimburses Merchants only if a Merchant provides a timely (within 30 days) notification and complete report of a data security event or regulatory action as soon as the Merchant becomes aware of such event or action.
Merchants will need to provide details on the data security event or regulatory action including, but not limited to: a complete description of the data security event or regulatory action, all documents relating to the data security event or regulatory action, and any other pertinent information requested by or on behalf of SecurityMetrics.
To report a data security event or regulatory action under the Program, contact SecurityMetrics at: Breach_Reporting@securitymetrics.com.</p>
</li>
<li>Reimbursement Process.
<ol>

Merchants may email SecurityMetrics at the email address above, or by certified mail to 1275 West 1600 North, Orem, Utah 84057.</li>
<li>Once an invoice is received by SecurityMetrics, SecurityMetrics will determine whether the PSW applies to the Merchant's breach or compromise.
If SecurityMetrics determines that the PSW applies and SecurityMetrics will reimburse the Merchant in accordance with the PSW terms, then SecurityMetrics will provide the Merchant with the reimbursement in a reasonable time.
If SecurityMetrics determines that the PSW doesn't apply, then SecurityMetrics will notify the Merchant that no reimbursement is available.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Limitation of Liability for the Program.
