         COPPA &amp.
FERPA in the USA <p>This policy is in accordance with the U.S.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and outlines our practices world-wide regarding the personal information of all students under 13.
For more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children’s online privacy, please visit OnGuard Online.</p>
<p>The policies for childrens’ privacy protection outlined in this Privacy Policy are intended to supplement the information appearing in the general Privacy Policy and apply to all students in education, not only those under age 13.
Where this COPPA Privacy Policy conflicts with our general Privacy Policy concerning information about a Child, the terms of this COPPA Privacy Policy will prevail over our general Privacy Policy.</p> Teacher or schools consent in lieu of a parent&nbsp.
<p>Kami collects limited personal information from students where that student’s school, district, or teacher has provided access to the Kami service, which collects personal information solely for the use and benefit of the learning environment.
Kami requires schools, districts, or teachers to obtain parental consent from parents.</p>
<p>If you are accessing Kami on behalf of a Class, School or District, anywhere in the world, the following provisions also apply:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>You represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirement to secure parental consent for accessing applications which require personal information from children under 13.</li>
<li>With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children.
We recommend that Schools should always notify parents about these activities.</li>
<li>You may need to obtain verifiable parental consent (“Consent”) from all parents whose children will be accessing Kami and provide a copy to us upon our request.
For more information on your obligations under COPPA, please see www.ftc.gov/privacy.</li>
<li>When obtaining such consent, you undertake to provide parents with a copy of our Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul> Personal information stored <p>In order to create a unique account, Kami does require that all users enter their email address and create a password, which is stored on the site, or use their own Google or Microsoft Account to sign on (Single-Sign-On), and may collect additional information such as name of school or class, and whether they are a teacher or student, in order to assign the user to the correct user group.
Documents may be uploaded to Kami by users in order to share them with other users for collaborative processing.
Kami does not store these files once the sharing process is completed.
Annotations made by users are stored on the site in order to display them to other users viewing a shared document, and to display them to the user if the same file is later re-opened.</p>

<p>For further information you can contact either privacy@kamiapp.com or our local EU GDPR representative at dpo@dpa.bg</p>
<p>
</p> Transfer
<p>
<b>The GDPR requires that when any EU user’s personal data is hosted or processed outside of the European Economic Area, it must remain protected to an adequate standard in line with EU law.
There are a few ways that Kami achieves this:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>First</b>, some of our EU customers’ data is processed in New Zealand (where our Headquarters are located).
New Zealand is recognized by the EU as a territory that ensures an adequate level of data protection decided by 2013/65/EU: Commission Implementing Decision of 19 December 2012 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data by New Zealand (notified under document C(2012) 9557) Text with EEA relevance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we hold EU customer data in other territories, like the US, we take other ‘Appropriate Safeguards’ that are prescribed by the GDPR.
Specifically, we either transfer your data to countries which are providing adequate protection according to EU or we enter into Data Processing Agreements with Customers in which we rely on EU Standard Contractual Clauses (also called Model Clauses) published by the European Commission to protect EU data.
These are standard form data export agreements that have been approved by the European Commission as a lawful basis for transferring personal data to non-EEA countries like the USA.
Our standard Data Processing Agreement is available and can be downloaded here to sign upon request.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Secondly</b>, When we hold EU customer data in other territories, like the USA, we take other ‘Appropriate Safeguards’ that are prescribed by the GDPR.
Specifically, we enter into Data Processing Agreements with Customers in which we rely on EU Standard Contractual Clauses (also called the SCCs or the EU Model Clauses) published by the European Commission to enforce the protection of EU users’ data.
These are standard form data export agreements that have been approved by the European Commission as a lawful basis for transferring personal data to non-EEA countries like the USA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our standard Data Processing Agreement incorporating the EU Model Clauses can be downloaded here to sign upon request, but is already incorporated into our Standard Terms of Service and applies to you.</p>
<p>(Kami wants to notify you that since July 16, 2020 according to a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the PrivacyShield&nbsp.
agreement governing the transfer of EU citizens’ data to the United States is no longer applicable.
As a result of that the EU-U.S.
PrivacyShield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States.
However as the regulatory and legislative landscape evolves, we will always work to ensure that our customers and partners can continue to enjoy the benefits of our services and maximum protections everywhere they operate.
This is the reason why we still continue to comply with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Thirdly</b>, we have verified that our US-based cloud hosting providers are working with us according to agreements which include SCC (EU Model clauses) as explained above.
Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Amazon Web Services</b> – our agreement with AWS incorporates the EU SCCs for GDPR-compliant protection of EU users’ data as confirmed here.</li>
<li>
<b>Google</b>
<b>Cloud Platform</b>&nbsp.
– our agreement with GCP incorporates the EU SCCs for GDPR-compliant protection of EU users’ data as confirmed here.</li>
<li>
<b>Groove</b> – our agreement with Groove incorporates a DPA using the EU SCCs for GDPR-compliant protection of EU users’ data.</li>
<li>
<b>Stripe</b> – our agreement with Stripe incorporates the EU SCCs for GDPR-compliant protection of EU users’ data here</li>
</ul>
<p>Kami may not rely on a breach by a sub-processor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.</p> GDPR Rights of Arbitration <p>In case of a dispute or non-resolution related to privacy issues, European users may invoke binding arbitration via your EU data protection authority (DPAs).</p>
<p>
<b>Finally</b>, we have a <b>Designated Data Protection Representative</b> established in an EU member state, as required under the requirements of Article 27 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR).
You can contact our local EU representative here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>ILAC&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact person: Ginka HRISTOVA&nbsp;</p>
<p>E-Mail: dpo@dpa.bg</p> United Kingdom Privacy Rights <p>We comply with the data privacy requirements under the UK legislation.
There are interim provisions which allow the continued use of EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for restricted transfers.</p>
<p>Our standard Data Processing Agreement incorporating the EU SCCs can be downloaded here to sign upon request, but is already incorporated into our Standard Terms of Service.</p> California Privacy Rights <p>In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California residents who provide Personal Information (as defined in the statute) to obtain educational services are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the Personal Information we shared, if any, with others third parties.
If applicable, this information would include the categories of Personal Information and the names and addresses of those third parties with which we shared such personal information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in the current year will receive information about the prior year).
