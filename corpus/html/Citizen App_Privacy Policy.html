<p>Last Updated: August 13, 2020</p>Data Privacy at Citizen<p>Citizen’s mission is to keep you safe and informed.</p>
<p>
<strong>At Citizen (as in sp0n, Inc the company that operates the Citizen mobile app and www.citizen.com), our stance is that we will only use and share your data for the limited purposes described in this privacy policy.
We do not and will not serve advertisements in the app.</strong>
</p>Citizen Privacy PracticesOur principles for protecting your data<ul>
<li>We record the information we need to provide our services: Informing you of incidents happening around you, and helping you get emergency assistance when you’re in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The personal information we do collect we store for as short a duration as possible.
And, where possible, we store only de-identified or aggregate data that is not tied to you.</li>
<li>We involve as few third-party service providers as possible when touching your data.
The third parties we work with have contracts in place to prohibit reuse or sale of your data.</li>
<li>We generally limit access to your data to a subset of the engineering team.
We have specific systems to control data access, and all access is logged and regularly audited.
We perform a privacy review for all new features.</li>
<li>We take protecting your location data seriously.
We need accurate real-time location data to alert you of any emergencies and to help you get emergency assistance, but we lower the resolution of historical location data where possible.</li>
<li>We test the stability and security of our infrastructure, including annual penetration testing and review of our security systems and their configuration.
We use an information security firm to provide these services under a strict non-disclosure agreement.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Our services are designed to provide real-time notifications of incidents occurring near you, and to help you get assistance in the case of an emergency.
We can only provide those services in certain areas, so if you are located outside of one of those areas, the services may not work for you.
We only provide our service in the United States, so we apply U.S.
law to our privacy practices.</li>
</ul>Public data<ul>
<li>Content visible to any other user on the Citizen platform is considered public data (for example, publicly posted comments and videos).
You have control over public data on Citizen tied to your account, and can delete comments and videos you have posted.
Furthermore, you can email support@citizen.com to request to delete your account and coordinated information.</li>
</ul>Private data&nbsp;<p>Content not publicly accessible to other users on the platform is considered private data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Contact information:</strong>&nbsp;We use your email address and phone number to set up and validate your user account and to prevent abuse of the platform.&nbsp.
If you subscribe to Citizen Protect, we will also collect your name.
We may also send you emails about Citizen – you can choose to opt out of any marketing emails by following the instructions at the bottom of the email, but we may still send you some important emails, such as to respond to a question, feedback, or request you send us.</li>
<li>
<strong>Payment information:</strong>&nbsp;We will request your payment card details and billing address if you subscribe to paid features of the app, such as Citizen Protect.</li>
<li>
<strong>Health information:</strong>&nbsp;If you elect to use Citizen Protect’s Watch My Back feature, you may connect your phone or activity-tracking device, such as your Fitbit or Apple Watch, to share your walking pace and heart rate with the family members and friends you choose to watch over you in unsafe situations (your “Watchers”).&nbsp.
If you use Citizen Protect’s SOS feature, you may also provide us with your medical history and other information that may be helpful to our staff and first responders to assist you in case of an emergency.</li>
<li>
<strong>Audio and video feed</strong>: If you use Citizen Protect, you may share an audio and video feed from your device with your Watchers and emergency contacts as well as with our agents when you’re feeling unsafe.&nbsp.
We may record your audio conversations with our agents for quality assurance and legal purposes.</li>
<li>
<strong>User locations:</strong>&nbsp;We use your geolocation data to send you safety notifications for incidents reported near you and, if you sign up for Citizen Protect, to notify your Watchers, your emergency contacts, our agents, and first responders of your whereabouts.
You choose whether to share your location, and can always revoke Citizen’s access to your location data in your device settings, but the app will not properly function if the app can’t access location data.</li>
<li>
<strong>User activity:</strong>&nbsp;We aggregate user activity data (like how you interact with Citizen, what times you use Citizen, what kind of device you have, etc.) for analysis to improve Citizen’s user experience.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>User contacts:</strong>&nbsp;You can choose to share your contacts with us to connect with them through the app, to suggest you as a connection to other users, to inform your family and friends of incidents near you if you use Citizen’s Inner Circle feature, or if you sign up for Citizen Protect, to invite family and friends to your subscription plan or designate them as Watchers or emergency contacts.
If another Citizen user shares their contacts with us, and you are one of those contacts, we may recommend to you that user and the user’s contacts as friends to connect with on Citizen.
Just as you can provide contact information about other users, they may share your information with us for the same purposes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Content you capture through Citizen:</strong>&nbsp;If you use Citizen to capture a video or other content you wish to make publicly available, we collect and store that content and additional information about the content and device you used (like the metadata associated with the content, unique device identifier, wireless network, etc.).</li>
<li>
<strong>Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;Like many online services, Citizen uses cookies to collect information on its website.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to tailor your experience with Citizen, and advertise Citizen on third-party websites and apps.
We also work with Facebook and Google ads integrations.
These integrations allow us to track the efficacy of our own advertising campaigns across the web.
We do not use these integrations to provide any manner of advertising on the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>How we share your information<p>We may share your data with service providers, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Branch:</strong>&nbsp;Branch allows us to attribute when content is shared from Citizen to the platform and source.</li>
<li>
<strong>Twilio:</strong>&nbsp;Twilio allows us to send you an SMS message to validate your account, or to enable you to invite your contacts to the platform.</li>
<li>
<strong>Google Cloud Services:</strong>&nbsp;We use Google to host our infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>We only partner with service providers that commit to use the information only to provide services to or on behalf of Citizen.</p>
<p>We may share videos posted publicly on the Citizen platform with news outlets in select circumstances.</p>
<p>If you decide to provide us with your contact list, we may share some of your personal information, including your use of the Citizen app, with others to invite them to connect with you in the app or to suggest you as a connection to other users.</p>
<p>If you use Citizen Protect’s Watch My Back feature, we will share some of your personal information with the family members and friends you choose to be your Watchers to allow them to monitor your whereabouts and wellbeing.</p>
<p>If you use Citizen Protect’s SOS feature, we may share some of your personal information with first responders and your emergency contacts in the event that you are experiencing an emergency and request assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction involving the sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of Citizen’s business or assets.
In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset.
If&nbsp;<strong>sp0n, Inc</strong>&nbsp;business or assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the personal information collected by Citizen and the company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may share personal information (a) with law enforcement as we’ve explained in the Information for Law Enforcement Authorities, (b) as otherwise required by law, (c) to enforce the terms and conditions that govern the platform and protection our rights, (d) and protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity.</p>How long we retain your data<p>We retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or an individual requests that we delete information about them.</p>How we protect your data<p>Citizen uses reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, loss, disclosure, alteration and destruction of personal information we maintain.
Unfortunately, data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed as completely secure.
Therefore, while Citizen strives to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information.
In the event that Citizen is required to notify you about a situation involving your data, we may do so by email or telephone to the extent permitted by law.</p>What choices you have regarding your data<p>You can make the following choices regarding your personal information:</p>

If and when a standard is established, Citizen may revise its policy on responding to these signals.</li>
