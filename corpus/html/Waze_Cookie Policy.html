</ul> HOW WE USE COOKIES? <p>
<strong>Below you can see a list of the types of cookies used by Waze.

our partners use cookies in advertising.</strong>
</p> Processes <p>Process cookies help the website to work and deliver services that the website visitor expects, like
navigating around web pages or accessing secure areas of the website.
Without these cookies, the
website cannot function properly.</p> Preferences <p>These cookies allow our websites to remember information that changes the way the site behaves or
looks, such as the region you are in.
For instance, by remembering your region, a website may be
able to provide you with relevant language preferences.
These cookies can also assist you in
changing text size, font, and other parts of web pages that you can personalize.</p>

functional but should not prevent it from working.</p> Authentication <p>We use these cookies to help us show you the right information and settings when you are logged-in
to our website.</p> Security <p>We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and
protect user data from unauthorized parties.</p> Session State <p>Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website.
This may include the
pages users visit most often and whether users get error messages from certain pages.
We use these
so-called ‘session state cookies’ to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users’
browsing experience.
Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the website unusable.</p> Advertising <p>Depending on your setting, we permit third-party ad partners (see a list below) to use cookies and
other technology from this site to market our services to you on other websites and online services
you visit.
These cookies also may help to limit the number of times that you see an ad and help us

<p>Learn more about how you can control Advertising Cookies.</p> Analytics <p>Google Analytics is Google’s analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how
their visitors engage with their properties.
It may use a set of cookies to collect information and
report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google.
The
main cookie used by Google Analytics is the ‘__ga’ cookie.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting website usage statistics, Google Analytics can also be used, together with
some of the Advertising cookies described above, to help show more relevant ads on Google properties
(like Google Search) and across the web and to measure interactions with the ads we show.</p>
