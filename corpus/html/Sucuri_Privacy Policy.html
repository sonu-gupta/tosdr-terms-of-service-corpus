</p>
<p>GoDaddy Media Temple, Inc.
d/b/a Sucuri cares about your privacy.
For this reason, we collect and use personal information only as needed to deliver our products, services, websites and mobile applications, and to communicate with you about the same, or as you have requested (collectively, our “Services”).
Your personal information includes information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Telephone number</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Billing and payment information</li>
<li>Candidate information (for job applicants)</li>
<li>Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Privacy Policy not only explains how and why we use your personal information that we collect, but also how you can access, update or otherwise take control of your personal information.</p>
<p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer(“DPO”) and our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at privacy@sucuri.net.
This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.</p> What information we collect, how we collect it, and why.
<p>Much of what you likely consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(1) create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2) request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(3) complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email).
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(4) participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’ d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be(as they vary from time to time):</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies and similar technologies</b> on our websites and our mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our Services.These technologies automatically collect data when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie / device IDs, page load time, server response time, and approximate location information to measure website performance and improve our systems, including optimizing DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations.
Specifically, interactions with the features, content and links(including those of third – parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services, Internet Protocol(IP) address, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data, information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and error data is collected.

<p>
<b>Supplemented Data</b> may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, assess the qualifications of a candidate for employment, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.
If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p> How we utilize information.
<p>We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or(3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes:</p> Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services.
<p>We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and / or interactions with our Services.We utilize this information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)</p>

<p>Diagnose problems with and identify any security and compliance risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services</p>

<p>We may share your personal information with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:</p>

</ul> Communicating with you.
<p>We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider regarding products or services you have signed up or purchased from us, such as necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party sites.
Please read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>

<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.

Privacy Shield Frameworks.
<p>On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a&nbsp;judgment&nbsp;declaring as “invalid” the European Commission’s Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield.
As a result of that decision, the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the U.S.
Department of Commerce continues to administer the Privacy Shield program, and our parent company, GoDaddy Operating Company, LLC is committed to subjecting all personal information received from the EU or Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S.
Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.</p>
<p>GoDaddy Media Temple, Inc.
is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.
GoDaddy Media Temple, Inc.
complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to each Privacy Shield Framework, GoDaddy Media Temple, Inc.
is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
In certain situations, GoDaddy Media Temple, Inc.
may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, GoDaddy Media Temple, Inc.
commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.
EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us in any manner provided in the “CONTACT US” section below in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>GoDaddy Media Temple, Inc.
has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.</p> ‘Do Not Track’ notifications.
