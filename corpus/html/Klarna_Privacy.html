</ul>Privacy.Data protection should be smoooth.
As you might’ve noticed, we’re not your typical financial services provider.
Just like we aim to remove all friction from your payment related matters, we believe your privacy can’t just be an afterthought.
The world today is complex and confusing enough.
We’re not here to add to that.Read Klarna's Privacy PolicyPrivacy supportMaking your data work for you.<p>Great experiences shouldn’t have to come at the expense of your privacy.
Your data helps us provide you with an intuitive, quick and automated experience so you can stop worrying about how long it takes to make a payment, and spend more time doing the things you love.</p>Being open.<p>We always strive to tell you about our data practices.
That’s why this page is aimed at providing you with a useful and digestible overview on our data protection practices, on top of our more extensive privacy notice.</p>Meeting our responsibilities.<p>When you’re sharing your data with us, we know you trust us to do what’s right.
As a financial institution, we need to comply with a number of data practice rules.
We take this extremely seriously and always keep your best interest at heart when complying with these.</p>Your data.
Your rights.<p>We understand that your data is...well, your data.
And when it comes to getting insights on our privacy standards, how we collect, use and store your data, and how you can control each of these steps, we believe it should be as simple as possible.</p>Offering security and support.<p>When it comes to trust, we know that giving you our word just isn’t enough.
That’s why we continuously work to introduce new ways to keep your data safe via our advanced security system and provide you with adequate support if you have privacy related questions.</p>
<p>We know that your time is valuable which is why we have summarized some of the key themes from our privacy notice in the following section.
For more detailed information please read our privacy policy.</p>
Our Privacy Policy in short.Background<p>Depending on your relationship with Klarna and where you reside, different portions of our Privacy Policy may be applicable to you.
Some personal information that Klarna possesses is governed by the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.&nbsp.
Additionally, if you are a California resident, some personal information we hold may be subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act.&nbsp.
We have tried to make clear which rights apply to your personal information depending on your relationship with Klarna.</p>
What is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act?<p>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a federal act that created various federal privacy and security requirements for financial institutions in 1999.
For example, you have the right to receive a Privacy Policy when you initiate a financial relationship with us.
GLBA also required financial institutions to implement security controls to safeguard your data that is in our possession.</p>
What is the California Consumer Privacy Act?<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is an act that was passed by the California legislature in 2018.
It took effect on January 1, 2020.
It provides individuals with privacy rights that are similar to existing rights under GLBA.
However, the rights under CCPA apply to all California residents, unlike GLBA rights, which apply to customers or consumers of financial institutions.</p>
What is the relationship between California Consumer Privacy Act and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act?<p>The CCPA includes an exception for personal information that is collected, processed, or disclosed pursuant to GLBA.
This is because as a consumer of our GLBA products or services, you already have many of the rights under the CCPA.</p>
The type of data we use<p>When you use Klarna, there’s two ways we receive your personal data: There’s personal information you provide when you interact with us (e.g.
when you provide your name and contact information, or when you utilize one of our services that use cookies or similar technologies) and there’s personal information we collect about you from a variety of other sources (e.g.
credit and fraud prevention agencies, or stores).</p>
<p>Personal information you share with us could for example include</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contact- and identification information – we need this information to be able to for example confirm your identity, offer you support, or carry out a credit assessment before granting credit.</li>
<li>Your payment information – we need this information to for example carry out transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal information we collect about you could for example relate to</p>
<ul>
<li>Name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, device identifiers, IP addresses, and financial account information that you provide, such as credit or debit card numbers.</li>
<li>Information about the interaction between you and Klarna – This could include information on how you use our service or your repayment history with Klarna, which we use to tailor our products to you, offer you support or carry out credit risk assessments before granting credit.</li>
</ul>
Why we use your data<p>As we continuously work to elevate your shopping experience, we may use your data for a number of reasons, including to</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify your identity when you use our services or contact us</li>
<li>Engage with you as a customer</li>
<li>Provide you with the services you requested</li>
<li>Personalize content and experiences, including providing recommendations based on your preferences</li>
<li>Understand your eligibility for Klarna products and services</li>
<li>Communicate information on the products we offer</li>
<li>Conduct customer satisfaction surveys</li>
<li>Carry out credit and fraud assessments</li>
<li>Perform debt collection services</li>
<li>Perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of users of the Klarna Services and their purchasing patterns</li>
<li>Prevent IT attacks</li>
<li>Meet regulatory and legal requirements</li>
</ul>
How we use data to build a better service for you<p>As we’ve mentioned above, we believe your data should enhance your everyday life.
Below you can find some examples of how the personal data that you share with us, benefits you:</p>
<p>
<b>Paying with Klarna: </b>When you use one of our pay now, pay later, or financing services or use our one-time card (available in the app), we will carry out a credit check internally and via third parties, retrieve your contact and identification information and information about the interaction between you and Klarna.
This allows us to have a better understanding of your financial circumstances and your eligibility for certain products so as to provide you with the best options.</p>
<p>
<b>Autofill: </b>When you decide to purchase a certain item, we offer you the possibility to save your contact- and identification information and payment information so you don’t need to manually add them with every purchase.
You can choose to opt out of this feature in the ‘autofill settings’ during address registration in your purchase checkout or by reviewing the support section below.</p>
<p>
<b>Klarna app: </b>When you use the Klarna app through the mobile app or a web portal, we may collect information on your overall interactions with the app, your past purchases, your transactions via bank accounts you have connected, as well as items you’ve liked in the past or chosen to add to your Klarna app.
This is so we can improve our app experience, provide you with a more personalised in-app experience, such as the ability to track your deliveries, make you aware of price drops for items you’ve marked, remind you of upcoming payments, or give you a personal financial overview.</p>
<p>
<b>Support: </b>To be able to offer you efficient and personalised support, we collect your contact- and identification information and an overview on previous conversations.
This is so we are able to follow up on your questions and increase the speed at which we handle your inquiries.</p>
<p>
<b>Safe shopping: </b>When you use Klarna’s services we collect your contact- and identification information, payment and financial information, device information, information on goods and services provided, as well as information about the interaction between you’ve had with Klarna or stores, to be able to protect you against fraud and prevent attempts of money laundering.
This is so you can feel safe when using Klarna and we can be sure that you’re really who you claim to be when managing your finances.</p>
<p>
<b>Communication and offers: </b>If you’ve used Klarna in the past, we may also be collecting contact- and identification information, information about previous purchases and previous conversations with our support staff, as well as device information.
This is so we can reach out to you about new offers, products you might be interested in and updates you may be interested in.
You can easily opt out of these subscriptions by following steps laid out below.</p>
How you can control what information we collect and how we use it<p>There are a number of ways you can control the data we collect as well as the way we use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Autofill: </b>Within the Klarna app you can choose to opt out of the Auto-fill feature which automatically fills in relevant information when you make future purchases.
You can choose to opt out of the feature in the ‘autofill settings’ during address registration in your purchase checkout or by reviewing the support section below.</li>
<li>
<b>Marketing communication:</b> In order to unsubscribe from marketing sendouts you can easily click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of each email.
You can also reach out to us by email where you state your wish to opt-out from receiving marketing send outs.
For all contact information, please review the support section below.</li>
<li>
<b>Identification:</b> You can personalise how you would like us to verify your identity before each purchase within the Klarna app.

Security”</li>
</ul>
Exporting, removing &amp.
deleting your information<p>Klarna retains information about you as a customer in order to provide you with our services.
Your specific rights as a consumer may vary depending on the type of information, and where you reside, and are fully described in our Privacy Policy.
In general you retain the right to:</p>
<p>
<b>Request a copy of the data we collect about you</b> – You have the right to request a copy of your personal data.
In order to do so, please review the support section below.</p>
<p>
<b>Request that we rectify inaccurate or incomplete information about yourself</b> – In case you perceive information referring to you to be wrong or incomplete, you have the right to request the information to be rectified or completed.
If you want to make such changes, you simply contact us via our 24/7 chat or by contacting our support team, describing your request.</p>
<p>
<b>Terminate a product, service, or your whole relationship with Klarna </b>– You are able to manage, or terminate, most of our product and services directly in the Klarna app.
By terminating a product or service you thereby terminate the connected terms and conditions.
Should you have any questions on how to terminate a product or service, you are welcome to chat with us 24/7 via the app.</p>
<p>
<b>Request deletion of your personal data</b> – You have the right to request for personal data – that Klarna is not obliged to keep – to be deleted.&nbsp.
Please note that as a consequence, you won’t for example receive any marketing material from us nor be able to log in to our web portal or mobile app once this process has been completed.
If you wish to request your personal data to be deleted,&nbsp;please review the support section below.</p>
<p>If you wish to limit specific type of data you share with us, you can e.g.
always opt out from marketing sendouts, (see section “<i>How you can control what information we collect and how we use it</i>”)&nbsp;or remove certain products or services you have been using (see section “<i>Terminate a product, service, or your whole relationship with Klarna”</i>).</p>
<p>
<i>Retention of certain data</i>
</p>
<p>Please note that there may be instances where access to data or the right to delete specific information may be limited.
For example, as a financial institution, we are required to retain certain data by law, for example for Anti-Money Laundering purposes.
In addition to legal requirements, we may also retain certain information to protect both you and us, e.g.
for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<p>
<i>Identification before receiving access or erasure of data</i>
</p>
<p>In order to exercise your right to have your data erased or your right of access to your personal data, Klarna will need to identify you via, for example, via your identification information and information only you would have access to.
As a countermeasure to wrongfully disclose or delete personal data, we will always be required to properly identify you first.</p>
How and when we share your data<p>Depending on the service you wish to use, we may need to share some of your data with a select number of third parties, for example partners (cloud computing platforms, payment service providers or online selling platforms) or authorities.
To give you some examples, the reason for this may be so we can store your data safely, administer your purchases with stores, abide by regulatory requirements, prevent fraud, carry out credit risk assessments, or to communicate with you via a non-Klarna platform (e.g.
Facebook or Twitter).</p>
Compliance<p>When you choose to share your data with us, we know you trust us to do the right thing.
Doing the right thing not only means keeping your best interest in mind but also complying with applicable laws and requirements.
And when it comes to how and when we use your data, there are many rules governing such practices.
A more recent example includes complying with the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA), a law regulating data protection and privacy for all California Residents.</p>
<p>Being a financial institution, we also need to comply with a number of additional rules, for example the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) setting out how we may use and protect your financial information..
Under these rules we are sometimes required to store certain information or share details with public authorities when ordered to do so.</p>
<p>We take these responsibilities extremely seriously and always work to keep your best interest in mind when assessing how to best comply with them.</p>
Keeping your data safe<p>We heavily invest in our advanced security system which continuously monitors our systems to report any suspicious activity.
When you use Klarna, it’s important you know that before we even begin building our products, we go at length to assess any potential risks that could exist and strive to design the necessary countermeasures to make sure you stay safe.
Of course we encrypt your data where appropriate, while making sure that only the right people have access.</p>
