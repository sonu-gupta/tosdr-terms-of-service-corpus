</ul>Important information for California residents<p>
<strong>Scope.&nbsp.
</strong>This section applies only to California residents.
It describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents when we act as a “business” as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”), and their rights with respect to their Personal Information.&nbsp.
This section does not apply when we act as a “service provider” as defined under the CCPA, such as when we process personal information in connection with providing services to our business clients (including when we obtain personal information through our website on the “Support” page or during calls to our support phone numbers).&nbsp.
For purposes of this section, “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” has the meaning given in the CCPA but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA or information we collect from you in the course of providing services to you or receiving services from you where you are an employee, controlling owner, director, officer or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit or government agency.&nbsp.
In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your California privacy rights.</strong> As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.
However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.</p>

<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</li>
<li>Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information disclosed to each category of third-party recipient.</li>
<li>Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third-party recipient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Access.</strong> You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.</li>

<strong>Deletion.</strong> You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</li>

<strong>Opt-out of sales.</strong> If we sell your Personal Information, you can opt-out.

<li>
<strong>Opt-in.
</strong>If we know that you are younger than 16 years old, we will ask for your permission (or if you are younger than 13 years old, your parent’s or guardian’s permission) to sell your Personal Information before we do so.</li>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information.&nbsp;</strong> Like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you.&nbsp.
Our use of some of these services may be classified under California law as a “sale” of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services because they collect information from our users (e.g., device data and online activity data) to help them serve ads more likely to interest you.&nbsp.
You may request that we not use your personal data with these Advertising Partners by:<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>visiting singledigits.com/Preference-Center</li>

Government identification may be required.
You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification.&nbsp.
