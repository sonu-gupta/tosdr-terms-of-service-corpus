<strong>What is Common Application’s policy when there has been an allegation of fraud, misrepresentation, or other inappropriate act?</strong>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Summary:</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>In the event of an allegation of fraud, misrepresentation, or other inappropriate act involving an applicant, Common Application may disclose information, including where required by law or where necessary to protect our rights and the rights of our members.</em>
</p>
<p>Members, secondary schools, and applicants are advised that Common Application functions as a conduit of information between the student applicant, his/her secondary school, and the various member Colleges and Universities selected by the applicant.&nbsp.
As such, it is Common Application’s policy not to judge, evaluate, conduct any verification of, or perform an investigation on any information provided on or about a student applicant regardless of the source of that information.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>That said, where we have been informed of an act of fraud, misrepresentation, or other inappropriate act involving an applicant, in certain situations, Common Application may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>The Common Application reserves the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in any instance or circumstance when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, the rights of our members and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, police investigation, court order, or legal process served on the Common Application.
Subject to any rights afforded by law, Common Application also reserves the right upon notice to an applicant to disclose information collected from a registered user about which member Colleges and/or Universities a student applicant had applied to, including possibly suspending or closing an applicant’s on-line account upon notice to the student, when we have reason to believe that accessing and/or disclosing this information or taking such action is necessary to prevent, identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any of our on-line user agreements or policies or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Common Application rights or property, other Common Application users, members or schools, or to help protect anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
<p>Common Application may also disclose or access registered user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so and for administrative, technical, and other related purposes that we deem necessary to maintain or improve our services.
Subject to the terms and conditions of The Common Application, Inc.
Membership Non-Compliance Procedures, Common Application also reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove any College or University as a member without any further or special notice.</p>
<strong>What are the applicant's choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of information?</strong>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Summary:</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Common Application offers registrants a choice mechanism through which registrants can indicate whether they would like to receive communications from Common Application and member Colleges and Universities.&nbsp.
Common Application also offers its App users the ability to provide choice regarding push notifications.</em>
</p>
<p>You have the right not to provide us with any personal information about you when you visit the Properties (if applicable) but you will not be able to utilize our services unless you complete an on-line User Registration form.
When you first register with Common Application, you are given the option to choose to receive communications from member Colleges and Universities and have certain personal information released to our member Colleges and Universities on your "My Colleges List" prior to submission of your application to that selected member College or University.
</p>
<p>You must affirmatively "opt in" according to your preference.
Should you "opt in," you can later change your mind and "opt out" for any member College or University by using the "Unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of the email you receive from that member College or University.
Alternatively, you may "opt out" for all member Colleges and Universities by appropriately changing the setting located on your "Account Maintenance" page.&nbsp.
You can access the “Account Maintenance” page by clicking on the Settings icon in the upper right hand corner of your application after logging in.</p>
<p>Should you choose to "opt in," a limited amount of the personal information that you provided us will be released to your designated member Colleges and Universities prior to submission of your application to those selected members.
The personal information shared will include your name, permanent home address, ethnicity, sex, citizenship, date of birth, phone number(s), email address, and Social Security number.
In addition, your "opting-in" will allow member Colleges and Universities to use your information to contact you at any time and/or to text you at your cell phone number.</p>
<p>Should you choose to "opt out," a more limited amount of your personal information that you had provided us is released to your selected member Colleges and Universities to allow such Colleges and Universities to track the demographics of their prospective applicant pool as well as the ability to respond to inquiries from applicants who have indicated an interest in their institution.
The personal information shared will include your name, city, state, zip code, country, sex, citizenship, and date of birth.
</p>
<p>Once registered, while you are free not to provide any personal information requested on the Common Application form, any application supplement or other applicant form, to do so may cause the member College and/or University that you select not to accept the application, supplement or other applicant form as complete and consequently this may delay the application admission process or reject the submission as incomplete regardless of payment.
Users/applicants can also decide not to provide information that is designated as "optional" on any application, supplement, or other form and still utilize the service that we provide.
Users should communicate with their designated College and/or University directly if any admission application is delayed or rejected or otherwise results in an outcome that does not satisfy the applicant's expectations.
The Common Application is not involved in and cannot be held responsible for any admission outcome of any specific applicant.</p>
<p>When you register with Common Application, you are also required to express your communications preferences to receive communications from Common Application.
These communications may include emails, phone or text messages or physical mailings to your address.
These communications may go beyond the technical support of application submission to include information on financial aid, tips, and broader topics that Common Application feels would benefit you.
If you initially “opt in” to receiving communications from us and later decide that you would like to “opt out,” please contact the applicant Solutions Center with your request, using the “Instructions &amp.
Help” link from your applicant account, or by clicking on the gear icon from your applicant account and changing your communication preference.&nbsp;If you “opt out,” we may use your email address, your home address, and your cell phone number (if you opt in) to send or mail you registration and submission confirmation texts, physical mail, and/or emails, to contact you to help answer a technical support question that you may have posed to us regarding your use of the Properties.
If you select the “opt-out” option, we will not communicate with you beyond what is in technical support of your admission application process.
</p>
<p>Through our App, we send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about the admission application process.
If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.</p>
<p>For school officials, if you “opt out” of the online recommendation system via the email invitation initiated by the applicant, you will not receive any College/University specific information concerning their respective admissions process.
however, we may use your email address (User Name), cell phone number, and/or mailing address to send you registration and submission confirmation communications, text messages or emails, or we may need to contact the user/recommender to help answer a technical support question that you may have posed to us regarding your use of the Properties and to provide you with other information relevant to the student’s admission application process.
Additionally, any member colleges may communicate with you regarding the applicant, using the information you provide on any paper forms, or using contact information provided by the applicant on his or her application.</p>
