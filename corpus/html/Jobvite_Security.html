<p>All customer information, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that is stored in Jobvite’s service delivery environment, is protected at rest using AES-256-bit encryption.</p>
<p>
<strong>Key Management</strong>
<br> Jobvite uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage the creation and lifecycle of private encryption keys and enables the Jobvite API’s to leverage those keys to perform encryption, decryption and re‐encryption operations on customer‐provided data as needed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Retention</strong>
<br> Jobvite’s data retention for the Jobvite Recruitment Platform period is a rolling 6 months for application logs and system logs.
Jobvite customers can configure data retention policies specific to their needs in the platform using built-in product functionality based on the geographic regions to meet varying privacy regulations.&nbsp.
Outside of these customer-defined retention policies for personal data, customer data in the Jobvite Recruitment Platform is stored for the duration of the service contract between the customer and Jobvite.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Deletion</strong>
<br> The Jobvite Platform provides built-in product functionality for customers to delete personal data records using retention policies, as described above, or perform delete operations on-the-fly.&nbsp.

Data contained in data backups is deleted over the course of the standard cycling of data backups so that such backup data will all be deleted by 200 days following contract termination date unless otherwise directed by customer.
Deletion means removing or obliterating all customer personal data such that it cannot be recovered or reconstructed from Jobvite databases, systems or other repository.
