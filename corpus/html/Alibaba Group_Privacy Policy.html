<b>Third Party Links and Policies</b>
</p>
<p>The Website may contain links to other websites owned and operated by third parties and/or affiliates.
These third parties and affiliates may collect information from you.
These affiliates and third parties and their computer servers may be located in the People's Republic of China, the United States, or in other countries.
We do not control, and are not responsible for, the privacy and security practices of any third parties or affiliates.

<p>
<b>Do Not Track Policy</b>
</p>
<p>The laws of some jurisdictions require that operators of website and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal and whether other third parties may collect PII about an individual's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.</p>
<p>Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked.
Because there is not yet a common, global understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, Alibaba does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>
