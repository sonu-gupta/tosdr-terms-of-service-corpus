<li>Do-Not-Track Signals: Certain browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which such browsers communicate.
however, this feature, and how it is used and activated, varies from browser to browser.
Therefore, it is not clear whether the signals are intentionally transmitted by a user, or whether a user is even aware of this.
Despite current efforts, there is still disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations, industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no standard has been adopted to date.
The Republican Party of Texas takes privacy and security very seriously.
With respect to “do not track signals,” we currently do not respond to do-not-track signals.
Third parties may collect information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different Internet websites or online services when the consumer uses our Services.&nbsp.
If a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to do-not-track signals.&nbsp;</li>
