<p>How We Use Data Collection Technology: Data Collection Technology helps us improve your experience of the Services by, for example, storing your website language preferences, so you do not have to select it each time you use the Services, compiling statistics about use of the Services, helping us analyze technical and navigational information about the Services, and detecting and preventing fraud.</p>
<p>The Services use the following cookies:</p>

<p>Our Statement On Do Not Track Signals: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("<strong>DNT</strong>") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.
If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain personal data about the browser’s user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
For this reason, many website operators, including MiniTool, do not respond to DNT signals.</p> How We Process Personal Data <p>MiniTool processes personal data:</p>
