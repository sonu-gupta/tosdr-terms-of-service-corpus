         Terms of Use <p>Switched to Linux is an informational website that seeks to educate people on how easy the Linux operating system is to run.
Even though Linux is easy to use and we provide consulting services to help you install and use Linux, we are not responsible for any damages to your computers or equipment resulting from our videos, content, or consultation.
We will always do the best we can to help our paying customers with their computer consultations, but some instances arise where we are unable to completely resolve your computer issues.
Our general policy is that if we are unable to help you install Linux properly we do not charge for that time.</p>
