<p>You have the right to request deletion of personal information we hold about you and we have the obligation to erase your personal information, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed,</li>
<li>you withdraw consent on which the processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for the processing,</li>
<li>you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing,</li>

<p>You have the right to receive or transfer a copy of your personal information, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>we are relying upon your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party as the legal basis for the processing, and</li>
<li>personal information is processed by automatic means.</li>
</ul>

<li>Where personal information is subjected to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
This right includes restricting the processing of your personal information to only include storage of your personal information (e.g.

If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.</p>
<p>If you want to object to the processing of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.</p>

For transfers to countries without an adequacy decision by the European Commission, Algolia puts appropriate safeguards through contractual obligations.</p>
Right to Withdraw Consent
<em>If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding withdrawing consent for processing your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.</em>
<p>Where you have provided us with your consent to process personal information, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
