<strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE</strong>: UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE TO THESE TERMS BY FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN THE “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION BELOW, THESE TERMS WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.</p>1.

If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms.
In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.</p>2.

License<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, we hereby grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license worldwide, with the exception of countries that are embargoed or designated as supporting terrorist activities by the United States Government, for you to access and use the Services in connection with your internal business operations.</p>5.
Charges and Payment<p>5.1.<strong> Pricing.
</strong>Certain Services are offered under different pricing plans, the limits and features of which are available at www.figma.com/pricing, and further governed by https://www.figma.com/pricing-faq/.
Your rights and obligations with respect to certain Services will be based in part on the pricing plan you choose.</p>
<p>5.2.<strong> Payment Terms.</strong>
</p>
<p>5.2.1.
When you purchase Services (each such purchase, a “<strong>Subscription</strong>”), you expressly authorize us or our third-party payment processor to charge you for such Services.
You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment methods that you provide to us.</p>
<p>5.2.2.
All fees are stated and solely payable in U.S.
Dollars, non-refundable, and not subject to setoff.
You are solely responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, and any other fees you incur as a result of the charges billed by us.</p>
<p>5.2.3.
In the event that you fail to pay the full amount owed to us, we may limit your access to the Services, in addition to any other rights or remedies we may have.</p>
<p>5.3.
<strong>Authorization for Recurring Payments.</strong>
</p>
<p>5.3.1.
All pricing plans involve recurring fees (each, along with any applicable taxes and other charges are a “<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>”).
Depending on which options you choose, those fees may recur each month, quarter or year thereafter, at the then-current rate.
Please note that our fees are subject to change, although we will notify you before we effect any change.</p>
<p>5.3.2.
By agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Figma.
We (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you in accordance with the term of your Subscription (e.g., each month, quarter, or year), on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription using the payment information you have provided.</p>
<p>5.3.3.
In the event your Subscription begins on a day not contained in a later month, your payment method will be charged on such other day as we deem appropriate.
For example, if you started a monthly Subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date.
We may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges.</p>
<p>5.3.4.
Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Subscription in accordance with these Terms.</p>5.4.
Cancelling Subscriptions<p>5.4.1.
You may cancel your Subscription at any time but please note that such cancellation will only be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
Unless required by law, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION.</p>
<p>5.4.2.
To cancel, you can either (i) email us at support@figma.com and follow any instructions, if any, we provide to you in response to your cancellation request, or (ii) for some kinds of Subscriptions, initiate a cancellation through your Account settings within the Services.
You will be responsible for all Subscription Fees incurred for the then-current Subscription period.
Cancelling your Subscription will not terminate your Account.
See Section 10 (Termination) below for information on terminating your Account.</p>
<p>5.5.<strong> Taxes.
</strong>Subscription<strong>
</strong>Fees do not include taxes, and you agree to: (a) pay all sales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST, personal property, or other tax (including any interest and penalties) with respect to the transactions and payments under these Terms, other than taxes based on our income, employees, or real property.
and (b) be responsible for any filing of any information or tax returns with respect thereto.</p>
<p>5.6.
<strong>Withholding.
</strong>Further, all payments made by you to us under these Terms will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding.
If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required by law, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us after such deduction or withholding will be equal to the full amount that we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required.
Each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the other party to help obtain, reduce, or eliminate any necessary withholding, deduction, or royalty tax exemptions where applicable.</p>6.
Confidentiality.<p>6.1<strong> Confidential Information.</strong> We (the “<strong>Discloser</strong>”) have disclosed or may disclose proprietary or non-public business, technical, financial, or other information (“<strong>Confidential Information</strong>”) to you (the “<strong>Recipient</strong>”).
Our Confidential Information expressly includes non-public information regarding features, functionality, and performance of the Services, including security related information.</p>
<p>6.2<strong> Obligations.
</strong>The Recipient will use the Discloser’s Confidential Information only for the purpose of evaluating whether or not to use (or continue to use) the Services.
The Recipient will not disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information to parties other than the Recipient’s employees, contractors, affiliates, agents, or professional advisors (“<strong>Representatives</strong>”) who need to know it and who have a legal obligation to keep it confidential.
The Recipient will ensure that its Representatives are subject to no less restrictive confidentiality obligations than those herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information: (a) if directed by Discloser.
or (b) to the extent required by applicable legal process, provided that the Recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to (i) promptly notify the Discloser in advance, to the extent permitted by law, and (ii) comply with the Discloser’s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure.
The obligations set forth herein will survive for so long as these Terms are in effect between the parties and for five years thereafter.</p>7.
Warranties.<p>7.1.

Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, each party retains all right, title, and interest in and to its intellectual property rights.

<p>11.8.<strong> Feedback.
Use Rights.
</strong>We welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”).
As we need to be able to freely work with your Feedback to improve the Services, you hereby irrevocably transfer and assign all right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights, such as copyrights or trade secrets) in and to the Feedback, including any and all “moral rights” that you might have in such Feedback, and you hereby forever waive and agree never to assert any and all “moral rights” you may have in the Feedback.
Additionally, Figma will have the right to collect and analyze data and other information relating to the provision, use, and performance of various aspects of the Services, and related systems and technologies, and Figma will be free to use such data and information to maintain, improve, and enhance Figma’s products and services.</p>

<strong>11.17.</strong>
<strong>Dispute Resolution for Individuals</strong>
</p>
<p>You and we both agree to resolve disputes related to your use of the Services or these Terms (each, a “<strong>Claim</strong>”) in binding arbitration instead of court, except that either party may bring suit in court to enjoin the infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>What is arbitration?</strong>
</p>
<p>Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury.
Instead, a neutral person (the “arbitrator”) hears each party’s side of the dispute and makes a decision that is finally binding on both parties.
The arbitrator can award the same relief as a court could, including monetary damages.
While court review of an arbitration award is limited, if a party fails to comply with the arbitrator’s decision, then the other party can have the arbitration decision enforced by a court.</p>
<p>
<strong>Can a Claim be part of a class action or similar proceeding?</strong>
</p>
<p>NO.
YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIMS WITH US SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.
WE AGREE TO DO THE SAME, WHETHER OR NOT YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION.
ACCORDINGLY, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.</p>
<p>
<strong>What rules apply in the arbitration?</strong>
</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted under the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”).
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>
<p>
<strong>How will the arbitration be conducted? How much does it cost?</strong>
</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA or a comparable arbitration body in the event the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees if your Claim is for less than $10,000, and we won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and costs if we prevail in the arbitration.
The arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g., by videoconference), in San Francisco, California, United States or at some other location that we both agree to.</p>
<p>
<strong>How do I start an arbitration proceeding?</strong>
</p>
<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding against us, send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claim to legal@figma.com, 760 Market St, Floor 10, San Francisco, CA 94102.
If we request arbitration against you we will give you notice at the email address or street address you provided.</p>
<p>
<strong>INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTING-OUT OF ARBITRATION</strong>
</p>
<p>If you don’t want to agree to arbitrate your Claims as explained above, then you can opt-out of this arbitration agreement by notifying us of your decision in writing at legal@figma.com, 760 Market St, Floor 10, San Francisco, CA 94102.
You must opt-out within 30 days of the date you first agree to these Terms or any updated Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN THE ABSENCE OF ARBITRATION</strong>
</p>
<p>The sole jurisdiction and venue for any Claims that are not handled by arbitration will be the state and U.S.
federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.
BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FIGMA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.</p>
<p>This Section 11.17 only applies to Claims between us and individuals, and is governed by The Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>11.18.<strong> Dispute Resolution for Entities.
</strong>If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, any claim, cause of action, or dispute between the company or other legal entity and Figma arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved exclusively accordingly to the process set forth in Section 11.17, except that, to the extent legally permitted, (1) each party will be responsible for their own filing, administrative, arbitrative and similar fees, (2) the losing party will pay the prevailing party for all costs and attorney’s fees and (3) the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply to any arbitration between us.</p>
<p>11.19.<strong> Interpretation.</strong> Whenever the words “including,” “include,” or “includes” are used herein, they will be deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation.”</p>
<p>11.20.<strong> Beta Features.</strong> Product features clearly identified as Alpha or Beta features (collectively “<strong>Early Access Features</strong>”) made available by Figma are provided to you for testing purposes only, and Figma does not make any commitment to provide Early Access Features in any future versions of the Services.
You are not obligated to use Early Access Features.
Figma may immediately and without notice remove Early Access Features for any reason without liability to you.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, all Early Access Features are provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind and without any performance obligations.</p>
<p>11.21.<strong> Entire Terms</strong>.
These Terms supersedes all other agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter.
The parties expressly agree that any different or additional terms set forth in any purchase order, vendor portal, code of conduct, or other similar documentation provided by you will not apply between the parties even if signed, acknowledged or accepted by Figma, unless Figma specifically references this clause and waives its rights.</p>Exhibit A – Service Terms<p>
