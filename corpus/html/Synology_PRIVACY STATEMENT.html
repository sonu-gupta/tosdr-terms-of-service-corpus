Some of these safeguards include the use of pseudonymization, data encryption, data hashing, and other technologies and permission control methods.
When our employees directly handle or access your personal information, we do so on secured networks and through fine-grained permission control to limit who can access your information.
Data you provide to us is encrypted and stored on both third-party storage and on Synology-managed devices, depending on the service.</p>
<p>Synology logs and stores IP addresses of both users to our web services solely for security purposes.
This log is archived and then removed at irregular intervals depending on ongoing or existing security threats or investigations.

<p>Synology removes data that is no longer required to provide services based on each service.</p> Changes to Statement <p>Synology may make amendments to this document when needed to reflect statement updates, customer feedback, as well as new products or services.
We will provide a brief overview of the changes, and if the terms modify the way we process or handle your data or affect your rights, we will notify you through direct message or by posting notices if we are unable to directly reach you.
