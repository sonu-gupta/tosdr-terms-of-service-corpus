         Privacy Q&amp;A <p> This Privacy Statement explains what information Privacy Guides and its related entities collect about its users, what we do with that information, and how we handle the content you place in our products and services.

We make that information available to everyone who can access the website or service in question.
This information is not required to use any of our services, and can be erased at any time.</p>
<p>We will store your account data as long as your account remains open.
