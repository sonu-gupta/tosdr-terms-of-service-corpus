Your California Privacy Rights
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
<p>For business purposes in the last twelve months, Cisco may have collected, used, and shared personal information about you as described in this privacy statement.
Each category of data that may be used by Cisco or shared with third parties is outlined in this statement.</p>
<p>All individuals have the right to request access to and deletion of the information Cisco holds about them either online or by mail to Cisco Systems, Inc., Privacy Legal Department, 170 West Tasman Dr., San Jose, CA 95134, USA.
In addition, California residents may submit a request by calling direct 408-906-2726 or toll free 833-774-2726 (833-PRI-CSCO).
Cisco does not sell personal information without consent.</p>
<p>Cisco will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under CCPA.
Specifically, we will not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deny access to our Solutions;</li>
<li>Charge a different rate for the use of our Solutions.
or</li>
<li>Provide a different quality of service.</li>
</ul>
California Shine the Light
<p>Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.
Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
<p>Cisco qualifies for the alternative option.
We have a comprehensive privacy statement, and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.
Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third-party disclosure choices or CCPA rights, please click here.</p>
