/members/ID/notifications/discussions Data dumps <p>You can download CSV and JSON files of data from The Session on Github (.zip).
These are updated about once a week.</p>
<p>That Githup repo also has the same data bundled up into a SQLite database.
You can run queries against that database at thesession.vercel.app.
The result of any query you run has its own URL and is also available as JSONâ€”that means you can use them as an API.</p>
<p>If you prefer to work with GraphQL, you can use thesession.vercel.app/graphql to try out GraphQL queries.</p> menu Log in
