<li> Description of the service <p>The iubenda Privacy Controls and Cookie Solution provided by iubenda allows websites and apps to request and manage consent for the use of cookies and similar technologies.<br>
<br>Upon the final user’s first visit, the solution displays a banner through which the notice is served and the consent options are made available.
In particular, the final user can accept or refuse the installation of cookies and personalize the consent’s preferences.<br>
<br>If the Cookie Preference Log (“CPL”) is enabled, the consent preferences for the installation of cookies expressed by final users are stored in the CPL and can be retrieved at any time.<br>
<br>When the final user navigates on a website/application where our Cookie Solution is installed, a technical cookie is injected which contains the following information:<br>
<br>* Cookie Policy id number;<br>* consent date and time;<br>* consent content (accept/reject);<br>* how the consent has been given (banner dismissal, button click etc.).<br>
<br>Depending on the configuration chosen, such technical cookie can be stored either on the iubenda.com domain (if the option enableRemoteConsent is active), or on the client’s domain (default setting).<br>
<br>From the above information, iubenda retrieves aggregate counters per day which indicate the number of consents given vs.
the totality of the consents requested, including the indication of how the consent is given.<br>
<br>Furthermore, iubenda as data controller, processes the following access data which is strictly necessary for the technical provision of the service:<br>
<br>* IP address;<br>* Web browser info (User Agent/type of device);<br>* Referrer (page viewed by the User) and all the information possibly available on the http header.<br>
<br>The information outlined above, is sent to Bunny CDN which, in turn, forwards it to Akamai CDN.
This forwarding is done, in the case of users in the European Union, without transmitting their IP address.<br>
<br>Further information about Akamai CDN and Bunny CDN can be found in the section "Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data" in the present document.<br>
<br>The Cookie Solution is also designed to apply the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) standards, if the CCPA option is activated.
When accessing a website or app, the solution displays via the banner a notice at collection of personal information which may include a DNSMPI link (“Do Not Sell My Personal Information”).<br>
<br>Pursuant to the CCPA, the category of personal information collected by iubenda through the Cookie Solution is: internet information.<br>
<br>The personal information collected are processed by iubenda as “service provider” for the purpose of ensuring a correct execution of the Cookie Solution and its functionalities (“business purpose”).<br>
<br>
<b>Personal Data retention time</b>
<br>
<br>The information collected through the Cookie Solution are not normally retained by iubenda.<br>However, if necessary to monitor the service, and the proper functioning thereof, the following access data will be stored for a maximum period of time of 15 days: IP address, Web browser information, Referrer.<br>
<br>
<b>Appointment of iubenda as Data Processor</b>
<br>
<br>The clients acknowledge and accept that by using the Cookie Solution they are engaging iubenda to process Personal Data as “processor” pursuant to the European personal data protection legislation.
The conditions of engagement are determined by the Data Processing Agreement.<br>
<br>Such an agreement, the conclusion of which is required by law, therefore forms an integral and binding part of the contractual relationship between iubenda and its clients.<br>

<p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>

<ul>
<li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
<li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>
<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.</p>
<p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>

Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need.
In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period.
Only with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.</p>
<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request.

You can freely give, deny, or withdraw such consent at any time using the contact details provided in this document.</p> How we use the data we collect: sharing of your personal data with third parties <p> We share your personal data with the third parties <b>listed in detail in the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document</b>.
These third parties are grouped and categorized in accordance with the different purposes of processing.<br>
For our purposes, the word "third party" means "a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or body other than the consumer, controller, processor, or an affiliate of the processor or the controller" as defined by the VCDPA.</p> Sale of your personal data <p>For our purposes, the word “sale” means any “exchange of personal data for monetary consideration by us to a third party“ as defined by the VCDPA.
<br>
Please note that according to the VCDPA, the disclosure of personal data to a processor that processes personal data on behalf of a controller does not constitute a sale.
<br>
As specified in the “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” section of this document, our use of your personal information may be considered a sale under VCDPA.</p> Your right to opt out of the sale of your personal data and how you can exercise it <p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal data.

<p>We use any personal data collected from you in connection with the submission of your opt-out request solely for the purpose of complying with the request.</p> Processing of your personal data for targeted advertising <p>We do not process your personal data for targeted advertising.
If we decide to do so, we will inform you beforehand and will grant your right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising.</p> Your privacy rights under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and how to exercise them <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your data processed by us.
In particular, you have the right to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>access personal data: the right to know.</b> You have the right to request that we confirm whether or not we are processing your personal data.
You also have the right to access such personal data.</li>
<li>
<b>correct inaccurate personal data.</b> You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal data we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the personal data.</li>
<li>
<b>request the deletion of your personal data.</b> You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal data.</li>
<li>
<b>obtain a copy of your personal data.</b> We will provide your personal data in a portable and usable format that allows you to transfer data easily to another entity – provided that this is technically feasible.</li>

<b>opt out of the processing of your personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising</b>, the <b>sale of personal data</b>, or <b>profiling</b> in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.</li>
<li>
<b>non-discrimination.</b> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the VCDPA.
This means that we will not, among other things, deny goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your consumer privacy rights.
However, if you refuse to provide your personal data to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal data, and that personal data or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.
To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to you, including offering goods or services for no fee, if you have exercised your right to opt out, or our offer is related to your voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program.</li>
</ul> How to exercise your rights
<p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your request to us by contacting us via the contact details provided in this document.</p>
<p>For us to respond to your request, we need to know who you are.</p>
<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity using commercially reasonable efforts and therefore confirm that the personal data in our possession actually relates to you.
In such cases, we may request that you provide additional information which is reasonably necessary to authenticate you and your request.</p>
<p>Making a consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
However, we may require you to use your existing account.
We will use any personal data collected from you in connection with your request solely for the purposes of authentication, without further disclosing the personal data, retaining it longer than necessary for purposes of authentication, or using it for unrelated purposes.</p>
<p>If you are an adult, you can make a request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.</p> How and when we are expected to handle your request

In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>
