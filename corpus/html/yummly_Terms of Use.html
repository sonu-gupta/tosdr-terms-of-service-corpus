and these Terms (including any claims relating to the validity, scope, interpretation, breach or enforceability of these Terms) (all of which are collectively referred to herein as <strong>Claims</strong>).</p>
<p>You agree that you will assert any Claim against Yummly and/or the Affiliated Entities by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>AAA</strong>) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (<strong>AAA Rules</strong>), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Unless Yummly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing(s) will take place in the province or jurisdiction in which you reside.</p>
<p>In the event that any provision of this Arbitration provision or the Class Action Waiver provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable in a particular case or jurisdiction, that provision will be severable in that case or jurisdiction, as the case may be, without affecting the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement, and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the Agreement in other cases and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In the event that you intend to commence an arbitration or a court proceeding, you must first notify Yummly by contacting us at the following address, with a copy also sent to support@yummly.com: ATTN: Legal Counsel.

<p>We agree to pay your filing, administration, service, case management, arbitrator and reasonable hearing fees.
You may be ordered to reimburse us in whole or in part for any of the amount that we pay if the arbitrator or the court, as the case may be, finds that any of your Claims were filed for purposes of harassment or are frivolous.</p>
CLASS ACTION WAIVER
<p>

<strong>EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND YUMMLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER, WHETHER BEFORE AN ARBITRATOR OR IN COURT, ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.</strong> You expressly waive any right you may have to bring or participate in a Claim as a class, collective or representative proceeding in court or before an arbitrator against Whirlpool and/or the Affiliated Entities.
