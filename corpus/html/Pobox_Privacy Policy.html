<p>We process mail sent and received from your account to block spam and
fraud.
We receive information from third party services to assist us in
identifying spam.
If you report a message to us, either through the service or
via customer support, as spam or not spam, we may share that message with
the third party service that flagged it to improve the accuracy of future
filtering.
See further below on your rights when we disclose your

email address you're sending to.
If you take action on mail in your mailbox,
we also log the activities taken.
This is necessary for providing proof of
delivery and fraud analysis.
For example, we need this information for detecting deliverability issues if there are failures sending email that we either detect through monitoring or when you ask if email you are sending/receiving is working properly.

</ul>
<p>We may share your personal information in the manner and for the purposes described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>with third parties who help manage our business and deliver services</strong>.
These include service providers who help manage our systems.
Some of these providers use "cloud based" IT applications or systems, which means that your Personal Information will be hosted on their servers, but under our control and direction.

<li>
<strong>with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product which you have requested or authorised</strong> â€” for example when sending emails to a friend, sharing photos or documents on shared drives, or linking accounts with another service from fastmail.
Or where you direct us to share your personal information with a third-party service provider in order to integrate our services with a service that they may provide, for example with a third-party calendar provider, mail provider or cloud file storage provider.
Again, we require all our service providers and third parties to respect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information and our contracts with them generally include obligations for them to comply with applicable privacy laws and to use any personal information we share with them solely for the purpose of providing services to us.
Any personal information which is provided directly by you and received by a third party directly may be stored and will be used by them according to their privacy policy;</li>
<li>
<strong>with account administrators</strong> â€” if you work for or are part of an organisation that uses Fastmail services, your account administrators and/or resellers who manage your account will have access to your Fastmail account.

<ul>
<li>access and retain information and your email stored in your account;</li>
<li>view statistics regarding your account;</li>
<li>change your account password</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>with government organisations and agencies, law enforcement, regulators</strong> to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules, and requests of law enforcement, regulatory and other governmental agencies;</li>
<li>
<strong>with banks and payment providers to authorise and complete payments</strong>, though we only maintain a record of your email address (for PayPal), or the last four digits of your credit card and expiry date (for credit card);</li>
<li>
<strong>if, in the future, we sell or transfer some or all of our business or assets</strong> to a third party, we may disclose information to a potential or actual third party purchaser of our business or assets.
and</li>
<li>
<strong>we may share in aggregate, statistical form, nonpersonal information regarding the visitors</strong> to our website, traffic patterns, and website usage with our partners and affiliates.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p> Explaining more about your marketing preferences <p>In this section you can find out more about:</p>
<ul>
<li>how we use personal information to keep you up to date with our products and services;</li>
<li>how you can manage your marketing preferences.
and</li>
<li>when and how we undertake profiling and analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p> How we use personal information to keep you up to date with our products and services <p>We may use your name and email address to send direct marketing communications to
you and let you know more about our services or related services that we believe
will be of interest to you.
We may contact you by email, or through other
communication channels that we think you may find helpful.
In all cases, we will
respect your preferences for how you would like us to manage marketing activity
with you.</p>
<p>
</p> How you can manage your marketing preferences <p>To protect your privacy rights and to ensure you have control over how we manage marketing with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>users of the Fastmail, Listbox and Pobox services can opt out of any non-essential communication by de-selecting the relevant checkbox in the settings page in the web interface;</li>
<li>even after opting in, you can ask us to stop sending email marketing by following the "unsubscribe" or opt-out links in electronic communications.
Alternatively you can contact us.
and</li>
<li>we will take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level and only send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p> When and how we undertake data analytics and profiling <p>We use Matomo, a web analysis service of InnoCraft Inc.
("Matomo").
Matomo uses cookies to monitor traffic to, and use of our marketing websites only.
There is no Matomo tracking once you are logged in.
Information about the use of our website generated by these cookies is generally transferred to a Matomo server in the USA and stored there.
Matomo uses this information on our behalf to evaluate usage of our website, and to compile reports on activities.
All personal information, including IP addresses, are anonymised by them.
Matomo respects Do Not Track browser flags.
you may opt out of tracking by setting your browser to Do Not Track.</p>
<p>We may use profiling or other forms of automated processing to assess if
your account may be fraudulent, a spam account or suspect in any way.
We may also use profiling to lock fraudulent or suspect accounts, including
any "stolen accounts".
Our monitoring systems detect high levels of outgoing
spam, or unusual login patterns which a staff member then reviews to
determine appropriate action.</p>
<p>We do not profile you to customise services for you, provide personalised
content or show you personalised advertisements based on your individual
interests, preferences, or related activities.</p>
<p>
</p> Transferring personal information globally <p>In this section you can find out more about:</p>
<ul>
<li>how we operate as a global business and transfer data internationally.
and</li>
<li>the arrangements we have in place to protect your personal information if we transfer it overseas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your personal information may be disclosed, transferred to or processed
outside of your country of residence.
This includes to Australia, the
United States of America, India, and the Netherlands, where it will be subject
to the laws of the country to which it is transferred.
These jurisdictions
may not have an equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your
country.</p>
<p>For EU/UK individuals â€” if you are an individual based in or a resident
of the European Union or the United Kingdom, your personal information
may be processed outside of the European Union, in countries such as the
United States of America, Australia, India, that are subject to
different standards of data protection.</p>
<p>We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information
are in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your
privacy rights and interests and transfers are limited to countries which
are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where
we can be satisfied that alternative arrangement are in place to protect
your privacy rights.
To this end:</p>
<ul>
<li>where we transfer your personal information outside of Fastmail or to third parties who help provide our services, we obtain contractual commitments from those third parties to protect your personal information.
Some of these assurances are well-recognised certification schemes like the EU US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal information transferred from within the EU to the United States and/or the use of EU approached Standard Contractual Clauses (<strong>"EU Model Clauses"</strong>) for controller to controller and /or controller to processor transfers from the EU/UK to jurisdictions, such as Australia who do not have an adequacy finding from the EU Commission.
or</li>
<li>where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information is disclosed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p> How we protect and store your information Security <p>We store most of your personal information electronically.
We implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, misuse or interference or the unauthorised disclosure, access or modification to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned.</p>
<p>The security of your information is paramount and a critical consideration for Fastmail in the provision of its services to you.
Please see further information on the security measures we engage on our websites and platform and when you use any of our services.</p>
<p>We work hard to protect you and Fastmail from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold.
Measures we take include:</p>
<ul>
<li>placing confidentiality requirements and restricted access protocols on our staff members and service providers who need access to your information in order to process it to provide our services to you;</li>
<li>destroying your personal information if it is no longer needed to provide you with our service;</li>
<li>destroying logging or other transactional information that may incidentally contain personal information in accordance with our schedules to clear such information;</li>
<li>following strict security procedures in the access, storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it.
and</li>
<li>using secure communication transmission software (known as "secure sockets layer" or "SSL") that encrypts all information you input on our website before it is sent to us.
SSL is an industry standard encryption protocol and this ensure that the information is reasonably protected against unauthorised interception.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer and/or device you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your user IDs and passwords, please take appropriate measures to protect this information.</p> How long do we store/retain your personal information <p>We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary
for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this privacy
policy.
Where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it is
disposed of in a secure manner.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods
of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting requirements.
Where we log information related to
your IP address, we retain this information for approximately 90 days.
This is for the purposes of fraud watch, as often users don't check in with us in a timely fashion over whether their account is compromised.
Being able to look at some amount of recent history and know what activity was taken by a legitimate user vs a malicious one is useful.</p>
<p>We proscribe your primary email address, if it's at one of our domains, for up
to 6 six months after your account is closed, to reduce the risk of
impersonation, should someone try to use the same email address as you in order
to impersonate you.</p>
<p>Where you request that we delete your account from our system, we will
immediately lock the account and archive the information, then delete it from
our severs within approximately 7 days from the date of your request.
This
archive window allows you to recover your information in the event of an
accident or malicious deletion request.</p>
<p>However, in specific limited circumstances we may store your personal
information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of
your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we
reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal
information or dealings.</p> Children's data <p>When a Fastmail product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction under which parental consent or authorisation is required to use the product, the product will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide consent or authorisation from a parent or guardian before they can use it.
We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is necessary to provide the product.</p>
