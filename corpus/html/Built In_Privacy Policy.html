<strong>Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information</strong>
</u>
</p>
<p>If you are a resident of California, you have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sale” is broadly defined to mean the sharing of personal information with third parties who are not acting as our service providers.
This may include our sharing of your information with prospective employers via our applicant database or other features that we offer to prospective employers.
If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of information sharing for purposes that may be a “sale” under California law, you may do so here.</p>
