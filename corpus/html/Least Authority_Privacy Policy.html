Statistical and Analytical Data</strong>
</p>
<p>The Least Authority website is currently hosted on WP Engine servers which are based in the European Union.
Unfortunately, WP Engine collects logs which include full IP addresses with no option to anonymize this data.
We are currently searching for an alternative and aim to move the Least Authority website by Q2 of 2020.&nbsp.

<p>Least Authority uses an open-source analytics program with a strong privacy focus, called Matomo.
It informs us about how visitors use our website.
Least Authority collects anonymous statistical data about the use of its website to optimise its online presence and for marketing and sales purposes.

<strong>3.
Delivering the Simple Secure Storage Service (“S4”) to customers.</strong>
</p>
<p>When you sign up for the S4 service, we only collect the bare minimum amount of information required to take payment, supply you with a service account and provide you with customer support.
The data collected includes your email address, payment and transaction details, and country of residence (for VAT reasons).</p>
<p>When you sign up, a connection is made to our payment processor,&nbsp;Stripe, which holds your card information and email address on Least Authority’s behalf.
LeastAuthority.com does not hold any credit card information on our servers.
Additionally, your email address and location (for tax purposes) are sent to&nbsp;Chargebee&nbsp;which holds this information on Least Authority’s behalf to support ongoing subscription payments.
Because of the nature of subscription billing, this also results in this service maintaining ongoing information about your subscription transactions.
This information is necessary to process your payments and fulfil the obligations of our subscription service.</p>
<p>Stripe is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1, the most stringent certification level.
The connections to both leastauthority.com and the Stripe API are made over TLS (with&nbsp;forward secrecy&nbsp;in modern browsers), so the security of your card information is at least as good as for other e-commerce sites.
Stripe is certified under&nbsp;Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>Chargebee is&nbsp;PCI-DSS Level 1 Service Provider.&nbsp;The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard&nbsp;encompasses a set of practices and procedures required to be followed by companies (the ones that process, store, or transmit card details) to establish protection of their customers’ card data.
Chargebee is also ISO certified.&nbsp;ISO 27001&nbsp;is an information security management standard that specifies the requirements for information security management best practices within an organization.
Chargebee has set up a&nbsp;GDPR Compliance Roadmap.</p>
<p>When you sign up, a connection is also made to our webservers.
In order to ensure the integrity and safety of our systems, we store webserver-log files containing the following details about your signup web request:<br>
date and time of the request, location of the request, access status, amount of data transferred, website from which the request originated, browser, operating system and its interface and the language and version of the browser software.<br>
We store such data for no longer than 14 days, the legal base for processing this information is our legitimate interest (Art.
6(1)(f) GDPR) of keeping our systems and servers secure and optimising our web content.</p>
<p>S4 uses an&nbsp;Amazon S3-based backend for&nbsp;Tahoe-LAFS, and provides what is called the ‘provider-independent security’.
The data you store on S4 is encrypted on your device before being stored on Amazon’s AWS servers, whether you are using Gridsync or the CLI (Command Line Interface).
Amazon AWS is EU-US Privacy Shield certified.</p>
<p>We use&nbsp;ZenDesk&nbsp;to manage customer support requests.
If you email&nbsp;support@leastauthority.com&nbsp;the email you send and any information you provide is transferred to ZenDesk.
ZenDesk is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, along with Binding Corporate Rules.</p>
<p>We store this data for the duration of providing the service to you plus a time period of 6 months, the legal base for this is the performance of a contract (Art.
6(1)(b)).</p>
<p>In addition we process your payment details and transactions for a period of 10 years.
The legal base for this processing is the legal requirement of complying to financial regulations (Art.
6(1)(c)).</p>

<strong>4.
Informing the general public about privacy advocacy updates through a mailing list.</strong>
</p>

<br>
We process contact name and contact information in the process of communicating about desired services, and in order to be able to send proposals and contracts for signing.
We delete this data within 6 months if no contract is concluded, or for the duration of the contract (until our services have been paid in full) plus 12 months in case a contract is concluded.
The legal base for this processing is the performance of a contract (Art.
6(1)(b) GDPR).</p>
<p>We use DocuSign for the signing of our consulting contracts.
DocuSign has approval for Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) – both as a data processor and as a data controller – from the EU Data Protection Authorities (DPA).
DocuSign is also committed to delivering world-class security that meets or exceeds US and international requirements, including the US ESIGN act, European Union Directive 1999/93/EC, and European Regulation 910/2014 (also known as eIDAS).

<p>In addition we process the company name and sometimes the contact name mentioned on the invoice for a period of 10 years.
The legal base for this processing is the legal requirement of complying to financial regulations (Art.
6(1)(c)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
Ensuring compliance</strong>
<br>
Least Authority will have to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to those of the European Union, Germany and the state of Berlin.
For this reason we may have to collect, process and retain your details for an extended period of time as a legal obligation (Art 6c, GDPR).
For example, one of the legal requirements in Germany is that trade invoices, which may include your name or email address, are kept for 10 years.</p>
<p>You also acknowledge that information required to track your choices and consent regarding the processing or use of your Personal Data or receipt of marketing materials may be stored to ensure compliance with the GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
