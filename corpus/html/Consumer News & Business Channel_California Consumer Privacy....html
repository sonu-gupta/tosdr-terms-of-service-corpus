<ul>
<li>Related Companies.

<li>Advertisers, Advertising Networks, and Other Third Parties.

When you do this some information about you will be passed to the platform.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Service Providers.
For example, we may user a vendor to collect data about a user’s ‘journey’—what webpage they start on, what pages they view and for how long--to optimize our website.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Search Engines.
For example, if you post a picture of a drawing you made on one of our websites, that drawing may then be available via search engines since the website is publicly available.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Law Enforcement.
For example, we may work with law enforcement if we detect potential fraud on one of our digital platforms.&nbsp;</li>
