<p>You can choose to opt out of this type of advertising permanently by going to http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</p>

</ul>What is online behavioural advertising/ interest based advertising?<p>Online behavioural advertising (also known as interest-based advertising) is a way of serving advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>Shared interests are grouped together based upon previous web browsing activity and web users are then served advertising which matches their shared interests.
In this way, advertising can be made as relevant and useful as possible.
Relevant ads can also be delivered based upon the website content you have just been viewing.
This is known as ‘retargeting’.</p>
<p>For more information refer to http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/</p>How do I opt out of online behavioural advertising?<p>There are a number of sites which can help you opt out of online behavioural advertising from the third party advertising agencies that operate online behavioural advertising for website publishers.</p>
<p>These include http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ and http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please note that opting out of online behavioural advertising using those services:</p>
<ul>
<li>does not mean that the advertising of British Airways’ products and services on our own websites will stop being personalised to your interests</li>
<li>may not stop all online behavioural advertising because it only applies to those third party advertising agencies that have signed up to those services</li>
<li>does not mean that there will no more advertising on this website or other websites you access.
However, the advertising that you do see is likely to be less relevant to your interests </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, deleting browser cookies can remove your opt out preferences, so you may need to opt out again.</p>More information about cookies used on ba.com
