It is a leading platform for entertainment content with millions of daily visitors.
As used in this EULA, “<strong>User</strong>” means any user of the Service.</p>

Furthermore, by using the Service, you affirm that either you are at least 18 years of age or have been authorized to use the Service by your parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age and entered into this EULA on your behalf.&nbsp.

Changes.&nbsp.
As the Service may undergo changes over time, we need the right to modify this EULA to match the changing functionalities of the Service.&nbsp.
You therefore agree that 9GAG may change this EULA at any time without prior notice other than posting an updated EULA to the 9GAG website or within our App.
9GAG will endeavor to provide you with prior notice when there are any material changes, and may require that you subsequently take an affirmative action acknowledging agreement to the revised EULA before continuing to access the Service.&nbsp.
You may read a current, effective copy of this EULA at any time at https://about.9gag.com/tos/&nbsp;.&nbsp.

If any change to this EULA is not acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop using the Service.&nbsp.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section 1.3, no revisions to this EULA will apply to any dispute between you and 9GAG that arose prior to the effective date of those revisions.</p>
<p>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.

MERCHANDISE</strong>
<p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Merchandise.&nbsp.
We may offer merchandise, physical or digital goods or services (collectively, “<strong>Merchandise</strong>”) for sale on the Website.
&nbsp;The price for Merchandise shall be displayed at the point of purchase.&nbsp.
You shall be responsible for the payment of any Merchandise purchased by you, as well as any shipping costs, taxes or other fees associated with Merchandise.&nbsp.
We reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue any Merchandise sold or offered for sale.</p>
<p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Currency.&nbsp.
All charges and payments for Merchandise will be made in U.S.
Dollars unless otherwise specified.&nbsp.
Currency exchange settlements and foreign transaction fees are based on your agreement with your credit card, debit card or other payment method provider.</p>
<p>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Orders.&nbsp.
All purchases of Merchandise made through the Service will be confirmed by an e-mail sent to the e-mail address affiliated with your User account or the e-mail address provided at the time of purchase.&nbsp.
If you have any questions regarding any purchase confirmation you receive, please direct your questions to support@9gag.com.&nbsp.
The purchase of Merchandise from any External Services shall be governed by the terms of such External Services and you are responsible for ensuring that you read, understand and agree to the terms of any External Services used by you to purchase any Merchandise.</p>
<p>7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Shipment.&nbsp.
We will arrange for shipment of Merchandise sold by us to you at the address set forth in any order information you provide to us.&nbsp.
Please check the individual order pages for specific delivery options.&nbsp.
We cannot currently ship Merchandise to Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Syria and North Korea.&nbsp.
Promotion code discounts do not apply to any shipping fees.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Title and Risk of Loss.
&nbsp;Title and risk of loss to Merchandise that you buy will pass to you upon delivery of the Merchandise, but the purchase of Merchandise shall not transfer any intellectual property rights in any Merchandise unless specifically noted.</p>
<p>7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Methods of Payment.&nbsp.
Merchandise purchases made through 9GAG can only be made using an approved payment mechanism (e.g., debit and credit cards).&nbsp.
We use one or more third parties to process payments for orders, such as, by way of example and not limitation, Apple Pay, PayPal, Stripe, and Shopify Payments.
(“<strong>Payment Processors</strong>”).&nbsp.
Payment Processors may require you to agree to their own terms and conditions.&nbsp.
We are not liable for any problems or disputes that you may have with such Payment Processors.
You authorize 9GAG and our Payment Processors to charge all sums for the purchases that you make on the Website.&nbsp.
Any processing or other transaction fees, whether imposed by an issuing bank of a credit card or Payment Processor involved in the processing of a payment transaction, are the sole responsibility of the User, as established by the Payment Processor.&nbsp.
You must be authorized to use the payment method used to make purchases through the Service.&nbsp.
9GAG may seek pre-authorization of your credit card prior to a purchase or charge to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.&nbsp.
These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge.&nbsp.
Charges for Merchandise occur within a reasonable time of the transaction or shortly thereafter, and 9GAG reserves the right to aggregate multiple charges together into one transaction where such multiple charges occur in close proximity to one another.&nbsp.
This aggregation will help reduce 9GAG’s credit card transaction fees and enable us to continue to offer the Service for free.&nbsp.
</p>
<p>7.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Taxes.&nbsp.
When you are a buyer of Merchandise, you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and fees arising out of such transaction.&nbsp.
You agree to indemnify and hold 9GAG harmless from any claims by any taxing authority arising out of your purchase of Merchandise on or through the Service.</p>
<p>7.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Refunds and Exchanges.&nbsp.
ALL SALES OF MERCHANDISE FROM THE SERVICE (BUT NOT NECESSARILY FROM EXTERNAL SERVICES) ARE FINAL, and 9GAG does not offer refunds for any purchased Merchandise.&nbsp.
If the Merchandise you purchased is misprinted, damaged, or defective, then in order to be eligible to exchange the Merchandise, you must submit a claim to us by sending an email to shop@9gag.com within four weeks from the date of receipt of the Merchandise.&nbsp.
If you do not receive your purchased Merchandise and believe it was lost in transit, then in order to be eligible to receive replacement Merchandise, you must submit a claim to us by sending an email to shop@9gag.com within four weeks of the estimated delivery date.
9GAG is not obligated to provide you with any exchanges or replacement merchandise if you fail to comply with the timing requirements set forth in this Section 7.8.</p>
<p>7.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Cancellation of Payments and Purchases.&nbsp.
Payments and purchases may not be cancelled by the User, except as required by law.&nbsp.
However, 9GAG reserves the right to refuse or terminate any purchase or attempted purchase at any time in its sole discretion.&nbsp.
You understand and agree that if you authorize a payment transaction with your credit card, debit card or other payment method, but your charge is rejected for any reason, there may be a hold on your use of that transaction amount for several days.</p>
<p>7.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS EULA, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTES REGARDING ANY CHARGE TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR CREDIT CARDS FOR PURCHASES THROUGH THE SERVICE (BUT NOT ANY EXTERNAL SERVICES) IN WRITING TO 9GAG WITHIN 60 DAYS OF SUCH CHARGE, OTHERWISE SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE WAIVED AND SUCH CHARGE WILL BE FINAL AND NOT SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE.</p>
