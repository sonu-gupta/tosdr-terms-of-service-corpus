</ul> Order submission <p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
<li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>

</ul>
<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p> Prices <p>Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.</p>

<ul>
<li>either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.</li>
</ul> Offers and discounts <p>The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase of Products.
Any such offer or discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the corresponding section of Snopes.</p>
<p>Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.</p>

If an offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as indicated in the Owner’s location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.</p> Coupons <p>Offers or discounts can be based on Coupons.</p>

<li>A Coupon may only be applied, in its entirety, at the actual time of purchase – partial use is not permitted;</li>

<li>A Coupon cannot be applied cumulatively;</li>
<li>The Coupon must be redeemed exclusively within the time specified in the offer.
After this period, the Coupon will automatically expire, precluding any possibility for the User to claim the relevant rights, including cash-out;</li>

Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p> Who the right of withdrawal applies to <p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>
<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p> Exercising the right of withdrawal <p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document.
Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.
In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>
<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of goods</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day on which the User or a third party – other than the carrier and designated by the User – takes physical possession of the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of several goods ordered together</strong> but delivered separately or in case of purchase of a single good consisting of multiple lots or pieces delivered separately, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day on which the User or a third party – other than the carrier and designated by the User – acquires physical possession of the last good, lot or piece.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of a service</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>In case of purchase of a digital content not supplied in a tangible medium</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>
</ul> Effects of withdrawal <p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract.
Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.
In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p> …on the purchase of physical goods <p>Unless the Owner has offered to collect the goods, Users shall send back the goods or hand them over to the Owner, or to a person authorized by the latter to receive the goods, without undue delay and in any event within 14 days from the day on which they communicated their decision to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>The deadline is met if the goods are handed to the carrier, or otherwise returned as indicated above, before the expiration of the 14-days-period for returning the goods.
The reimbursement may be withheld until reception of the goods, or until Users have supplied evidence of having returned the goods, whichever is the earliest.</p>
<p>Users shall only be liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling of the goods outside of that which is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and functioning.</p>
<p>
<strong>The costs of returning the goods are borne by the User</strong>.</p> …on the purchase of services <p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>
<p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p> Legal guarantee of conformity for goods <p>Under EU law, for a minimum period of 2 years after delivery, traders guarantee the conformity of the goods they sell.
This means that traders must ensure that the goods purchased have the promised quality, or the quality that can be reasonably expected, functionality or characteristics for at least two years after they’ve been delivered to the purchaser.</p>
<p>Where Users qualify as European Consumers, the legal guarantee of conformity for goods applies to the items available on Snopes in accordance with the laws of the country of their habitual residence.</p>
<p>National laws of such country may grant such Users broader rights.</p>
<p>Consumers who do not qualify as European may benefit from legal guarantee of conformity rights in accordance with the legislation of the country of their habitual residence.</p> Liability and indemnificationAustralian UsersLimitation of liability <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right).
