Introduction</p>
<p>Wealthfront Advisers LLC ("Wealthfront," an SEC-registered adviser) is an automated investment adviser available online and through mobile applications.</p>
<p>1.1 Purpose</p>
<p>We offer an automated investment service.
Should you choose to become our Client, we will manage a diversified, continually rebalanced portfolio of index funds on your behalf in a very low cost and tax-efficient manner.
Our unique service is made possible by combining a team of world-class financial experts, led by Dr.
Burton Malkiel, renowned economist and author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, with some of Silicon Valley’s best technology talent.</p>
<p>When you use our website and mobile applications you enter into a series of legally binding agreements.</p>
<p>You also agree to our Privacy Policy which covers how we collect, use, share and store your personal information.</p>
<p>1.2 Agreement</p>

Please therefore take the time to read the following binding Terms of Use below.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this agreement a User is an individual who uses our website or mobile application to evaluate our service, or for educational purposes and a Client is an individual who signs our Client Agreement that entitles the Client to have her or his investment portfolio managed by Wealthfront.
This Agreement, as well as the Privacy Policy applies to both Users and Clients.</p>
