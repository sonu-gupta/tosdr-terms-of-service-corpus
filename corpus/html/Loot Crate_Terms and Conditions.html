<p>
<strong>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</strong>
</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>This Arbitration Agreement facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Loot Crate.
Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.</p>
<p>Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.
It provides that all disputes between you and Loot Crate shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration replaces the right to go to court.
In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).
Except as otherwise provided, entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney's fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).</p>
<p>For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, "Loot Crate" means The Loot Company LLC and Loot Crate, Inc.
and their respective parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.
The term ‚ÄúDispute‚Äù means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Loot Crate regarding any aspect of your relationship with Loot Crate, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).
"Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.</p>
<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution:</p>
<p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Loot Crate an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.
You must commence this process by mailing written notification to The Loot Company LLC.
That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of the Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.
If Loot Crate does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.
You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
<p>You must initiate any Dispute within one (1) year after such the basis for your Dispute arose, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary.
In the event that you do not initiate your Dispute within such one (1) year period, such Dispute shall be time-barred.</p>
<p>Arbitration Procedures:</p>
<p>If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (‚ÄúPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution‚Äù) either you or Loot Crate may initiate arbitration proceedings.
The American Arbitration Association (‚ÄúAAA‚Äù),&nbsp;www.adr.org, or JAMS,&nbsp;www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.
The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration.
All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p>For arbitration before the AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.
In either instance, the AAA‚Äôs Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.
The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.
The JAMS rules are available atwww.jamsadr.com&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-352-5267.
This Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.
Under no circumstances will class action or representative action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
<p>Because your contract with Loot Crate, the Terms of Service, and this this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (‚ÄúFAA‚Äù) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.
However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>
<p>Arbitration Award:</p>
<p>The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.
The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p>Governing Law:</p>
<p>Your use of this Site constitutes your consent and submission to service of process under applicable United States law and your submission to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the State of California in New York county, for the purposes of any legal action or claim pertaining to these Terms of Service, or arising from the use of this Site, your user account and/or any website content and you hereby waive any defenses such as lack of personal jurisdiction or&nbsp;forum non conveniens.
These Terms of Service shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the law of the State of California, and without regard to the choice of law principles thereof</p>
<p>Location of Arbitration:</p>
<p>You may initiate arbitration in either Los Angeles, CA, or in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.
In the event that Loot Crate initiates an arbitration, it may only do so in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.</p>
<p>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs:</p>
<p>Loot Crate will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator‚Äôs costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.
You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.
Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.
In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Loot Crate as provided in the section above titled ‚ÄúPre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution‚Äù and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover from Loot Crate your actual and reasonable attorney‚Äôs fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>Disputes with other Users:</p>
<p>If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release Loot Crate‚Ñ¢ and from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown including without limitation attorney‚Äôs fees, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code ¬ß1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
<p>
<strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong>
</p>
<p>The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person‚Äôs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Loot Crate specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.
Neither you, nor any other Member of Loot Crate and/or user of Loot Crate services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding.</p>
<p>Limitation of Procedural Rights:</p>
<p>You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and Loot Crate are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court.
In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Loot Crate might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).
Except as otherwise provided below, you give up those rights.
Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration.
The right to appellate review of an arbitrator‚Äôs decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator‚Äôs decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.</p>
<p>Small Claims Court:</p>
<p>As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring a claim against Loot Crate in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction.
Such a claim may be brought in your name only, and not as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action.
No small claims court or other court shall have the right to consolidate multiple parties‚Äô claims or award relief to any person who is not a direct party to such small claims court proceeding.</p>
<p>Continuation:</p>
<p>This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with Loot Crate and your use of Loot Crate services.</p>
