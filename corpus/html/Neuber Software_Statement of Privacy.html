Contact Statement of Privacy <blockquote>
<p>
<strong>We respect your privacy! Ever since our website www.neuber.com came on line in 1997, we have been taking the utmost care with your data and treating it with the highest standards of confidentiality.
This begins with keeping data to a minimum or not gathering it at all.
Thus we do not use any behavior tracking or sharing tools, and we avoid using cookies wherever possible.
Your IP addresses are either anonymized or blocked within the CDN.
This keeps our websites thin and fast.
Whenever Analytics, Adwords, Adsense, Custom Search Engine or the like come into play, we always use settings with the highest degree of data-protection friendlinessâ€”meaning no remarketing, no profiling, no interest- or behavior-based advertising, no cross device tracking, no user id, only anonymous transmission of IP, minimal caching, and so on.
This is our way of ensuring that even third parties can obtain only minimal information about your surfing behavior, or none at all.
Even when buying our software, you can remain anonymous and you do not have to provide a complete address.
All this is intended to safeguard your personal data.</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.</p>
