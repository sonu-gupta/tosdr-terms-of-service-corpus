ARBITRATION AGREEMENT<p>Please Read This Section Carefully – It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court.
</p>
<p>The following sections below apply to legal disputes between Waste Management and a customer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Legal Disputes with businesses or commercial/industrial services:</b>
</p>
<p>For legal disputes between Waste Management and a business and/or for commercial services, please read https://www.wm.com/us/en/disputes for information on Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</p>
<p>
<b>Legal Disputes with individual consumers:</b>
</p>
<p>For legal disputes between Waste Management and an individual consumer, please see the following provisions on Dispute Resolution and Arbitration:</p>
<p>A.
<b> Initial Dispute Resolution</b>.
We are available by email at ntoacs@wm.com, or go to www.wm.com/support to find the appropriate customer service for your area to help address any concerns you may have regarding the Sites or any services you have ordered from us.
Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.
We and you agree to use best efforts to settle any disputes disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
</p>
<p>B.<b> Agreement to Binding Arbitration.</b> If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to paragraph A above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.
All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or our provision of any services shall be finally settled by binding individual arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class arbitration.
Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense.
The parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms and Conditions shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.
</p>
<p>The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures.
If you are a consumer and you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S.
Dollars ($250.00), we will pay the additional cost.
If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, the consumer submitting the claim also should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with Customer’s form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.
Waste Management will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with any consumer-initiated arbitration and, in such cases, the consumer filing the claim will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by WM if Customer does not prevail in arbitration.
The foregoing fee-related provisions will not apply in the case of disputes with commercial parties, which instead will be governed by the JAMS standard rules on fees.
</p>
<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
</p>
<p>C.<b> Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver.
</b> You and we each further agree that any arbitration – and any suit that, for any reason whatsoever, is deemed not covered by or subject to the above arbitration agreement— shall be conducted in our respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and we each expressly waive their rights to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph within the context of disputes subject to arbitration is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in paragraph B above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
</p>
<p>D.<b> Exception - Small Claims Court Claims, Intellectual Property Rights, and California Private Attorney General Act Claims</b>.
Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, (i) either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction, (ii) Waste Management may seek relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights relating to the Sites, and (iii) either party may seek relief in a court of law for a claim arising under California’s Private Attorney General Act.
</p>
