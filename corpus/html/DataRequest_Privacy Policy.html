         <p>Our privacy policy was last changed on September 20, 2021.</p> General remarks
# <p>Thank you for your interest in our privacy policy.
We are glad that you are interested in how we process your data.</p>
<p>We are committed to privacy, so we have designed our services from the ground up to collect as little data as possible.
We also try our best to keep data processing at a minimum.<br>
Most features on our websites will be executed entirely on your own computer, so the data you enter will never even reach our servers.
Furthermore, our websites can only be accessed via a TLS-encrypted connection to ensure that your connection to our server cannot be compromised by third parties.<br>
To exercise your privacy rights, we of course recommend using our generator which will help you generate the appropriate requests for free.</p>
<p>In this privacy policy, we would like to explain to you what data we collect and what rights you have.</p> Scope
# <p>This privacy policy applies to all activities of Datenanfragen.de e.&nbsp;V.
(“the association”).</p>
<p>This includes the data we collect and process from our member but also the data that is incurred from donations and the like.</p>
<p>In addition, this includes our websites Datenanfragen.de, datarequests.org, demandetesdonnees.fr, solicituddedatos.es, osobnipodaci.org, gegevensaanvragen.nl and pedidodedados.org.</p>
<p>The association’s purpose is to support the general public in exercising their right to privacy (“right to informational self-determination”) by informing and advising them with all questions regarding personal data protection.
We are bound by our constitution in all our activities.</p>
<p>With our website datarequests.org (as well as their translations), we want to help you exercise your right to privacy.
In order to do so, we offer a generator that helps you automatically generate requests, a company database with contact data for privacy-related requests to many companies and educational material on subjects related to privacy and data protection.
Finally, it has information on the association and allows you to join or donate among other things.</p> Controller and contact information
