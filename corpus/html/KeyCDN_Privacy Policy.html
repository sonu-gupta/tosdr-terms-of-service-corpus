We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.</p>Removal of Data<p>In the event that a customer wants to remove any personal data that was previously collected, KeyCDN will permanently delete such data.
Please contact our support team directly to do so.</p>
<p>There are certain third party services where all customer information will be delete instantly upon customer request while there are other third party services where the customer information might not be deleted instantly.
For example, if a customer wants to have their contact information removed from our email delivery service provider, this can be done immediately.
However, in terms of billing related data, this is required by law to keep for 10 years.
Credit card details are not stored with us anyway.</p>
<p>When personal data gets removed from our systems, the data is still present in backups.
This is to better serve our customers in the event that someone accidentally deleted their account or for disaster recovery purposes.
Backups are securely stored and isolated from any further processing.
They will get fully deleted when the retention period ends.</p>Data Portability<p>KeyCDN customers can ask to receive their personal data in a commonly used format.
Contact KeyCDN support to request this information and provide your PGP public key in order to receive the data encrypted by email.</p>Managing your Information<p>We communicate with users who subscribe to our services via email.
We use your email address to confirm your opening of an account, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services or to provide those products or services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law.
Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.</p>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us.
This includes things such as updates from us regarding new features or general web development and/or performance topics.</p>
<p>We're committed to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so.
If your data changes (for example, if you have a new email address), then you are responsible for updating that information in the KeyCDN dashboard.</p>
<p>Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information.
The retention period shall not exceed the duration of our business relationship with you unless we have a legitimate business interest need to retain the information for a longer period.
We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse or to enforce our agreements.</p>Third Party Service GDPR and Privacy Shield Compliance<p>At times, we use third party services to help better serve our customers.
Our email delivery service provider is an example of this.
In this case, customer information such as an email address is shared with the third party service, provided the customer has given consent to receive emails from us.</p>
<p>We've audited the third party services used at KeyCDN and as far as we know, they are GDPR compliant and Privacy Shield certified.</p>Your Acceptance of These Terms<p>By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this policy.
