<p>The privacy of your personal data and transparency<br>
in its processing is a priority objective of our corporate policies and a regulatory requirement.</p> Introduction
<p>This Privacy Policy is an integral part of Voicemod’s general terms and conditions and shall apply to the processing of personal data of users of our websites, products, services and applications, including both data provided by them directly and data that may be collected automatically or provided by third parties during the supply of any product, service or application requested and/or in the development of a contractual relationship with us.
Additional terms and conditions may also apply in your interaction with us, depending on the products and services you request and use at any given time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The access, use and maintenance of our sites, services and applications involves the processing of personal information of its users according to the purposes informed in this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The navigation or use of our websites, products, services and applications, as well as their options and functionalities, implies your agreement with their terms and conditions and our Privacy Policy.
The supply of any information required implies the acceptance of its processing in a manner consistent with the purpose for which it was supplied and your compliance with these conditions and policies.
Similarly, the acceptance of our conditions and policies through any of the options enabled, both on our websites and in our applications, implies full and unreserved acceptance of all its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should read our policy carefully to ensure that you fully understand it.
We have tried to include all the legally required aspects from a global and protectionist approach, although, given its length, if you have any questions, you can contact us directly at the address we have provided for this purpose: privacy@voicemod.net .
If you do not agree with our policies and conditions, we ask you to leave this website and not to use it or our applications and services.</p>
Who is responsible for processing your data?
<p>Voicemod, Limited Company (hereinafter, Voicemod), with NIF/VAT number B98657844 and with registered office at Obispo Don Jerónimo 10 street, CP 46003, Valencia (Spain), is the controller of your personal data while browsing and using its websites, products, services and applications.
Voicemod is the owner of the domain “voicemod.net” as well as of this website made available to its clients and users for the purpose of informing about its corporate identity, activities, products, services and applications, policies and conditions.
If you wish to contact us, you can do so at the following address: privacy@voicemod.net.</p>
What are the details about the processing of your data?
<p>We may process data about users of the websites, products, services and applications that we operate through our interactions with them and through those sites, products, services and applications.
This data will vary depending on the context of those interactions, features you use and, where appropriate, the choices you make, including managing preferences and settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information we collect and may process may include, but is not limited to, identifying information (such as username, email address, date of birth, and phone number if you chose to provide it), business information (such as purchase records and business communications), economic and financial information (payment information), technical information and location (such as IP address, device identifier, operating system, browser, microphones and headsets, device memory, advertising identifiers, application identifiers, language, battery level or time zone), usage and activity information when using the functionalities and utilities of our different services and applications, which may include image and voice without identifying purposes, values and technical parameters for quality of services, as well as other information that may be inferred from a user in an inherent or associated manner or that identifies or may reasonably be associated with a user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we request personal data from a user, the user can refuse to do so, although most of our products, services, utilities and applications require some personal data for their provision, access and use, so in these cases, if you choose not to provide the data required to provide a product, service, utility or application, you will not be able to use it.
Likewise, when we need to collect personal data by legal imperative to conclude a contract, fulfil or maintain it, if not provided, we cannot conclude or maintain it, and we may be forced to suspend or cancel it if it has been concluded, which we will inform you when appropriate.
If the provision of personal data is optional and a user chooses not to provide it, the services, functions and utilities related to such data, for example, personalization, may not work for the user.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
MINORS
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The contents, services, tools and utilities of our websites, as well as, in general, our products, services and applications have been directed and oriented to platforms and users that have the legal age of majority required by the legislation of their country of residence to authorize the processing of their data and to use the applications, products and services that they intend to have.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The request for any product, service or application must be made by persons with the legal capacity to do so according to their country of residence.
In the case of minors under 16 years of age, in compliance with the regulatory requirements applicable to you according to your country of residence, in order to process your data, it may be necessary for any application, activation or registration to be made by your parents or guardians or, where applicable, with their consent.
In such cases, it is they who must contact us to provide their identification data and, where appropriate, their prior consent to access and use of our products, services and applications.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The application and contracting of our products, applications and services by parents or guardians in their own name for their subsequent use by minors, implies knowledge and acceptance of their responsibility for all uses made by the minors in their charge, whether or not they are authorised by them.
If they allow the minor in their care to use our products, services and applications, they will do so under their exclusive supervision and responsibility, with full and unreserved acceptance of their respective conditions and of this policy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We do not knowingly process data on children under 16 years of age.
If we become aware that personal data has been provided or collected from a user under this age in or through our services or applications, we will take appropriate measures to delete them as soon as possible, reserving the right to suspend or terminate the services and use of applications that may be using.
We are not responsible for acts carried out by persons without the necessary legal capacity or by altering or hiding their conditions that make them unable to carry out such acts.
The parents or guardian of a child under 16 years of age who is a user of any of our services or applications, may contact us at privacy@voicemod.net to interrupt the services and applications they are using and to erase their data.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Voicemod operates and supports its products, services and applications from Europe (Spain) and worldwide, without prejudice to the use of platforms and suppliers located in other countries within the framework of its provision, subject to the provisions of the data protection regulations in force at any given time.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
User data may be stored or processed on our servers in Europe, without prejudice to the fact that it may be stored or processed in other countries where our suppliers related to our services and applications have their presence, operate or maintain their facilities.
Suppliers that may participate in our services and applications located outside the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) must have an adequate level of protection, under the conditions and guarantees required by law and contract.
Any international transfer will be carried out in compliance with the current legal framework.
Initially, we do not carry out international transfers of data processed on our servers in Europe and, if they could be carried out in the future or processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA), they will be carried out in accordance with the European legal framework in force and by means of transfer mechanisms authorized by the same.
The data transfers that may be carried out will be those necessary to operate and supply the applications, products and services described for the indicated purposes.
By using our applications, products and services, you acknowledge and agree that your data will be processed outside your country of residence and in accordance with the European data protection framework by us.
If your country of residence grants any other right that may not be covered by this policy, please inform us as soon as possible.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
SECURITY MEASURES
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Voicemod is committed to complying with its obligation of confidentiality and secrecy regarding the personal data it processes and adopts the administrative, technical and physical security measures required by the legislation on privacy in order to reasonably ensure their protection and avoid their alteration, loss, treatment or unauthorized access, taking into account at all times the state of technology.
However, we cannot fully guarantee the absolute invulnerability of our security systems or those of third parties, since no security measure currently in place is absolutely unbreakable, and Voicemod will therefore not be liable under any circumstances for any incidents that may arise in relation to personal data when they are derived from an attack or unauthorized access to its systems in such a way that it is impossible to detect them by the security systems in place, without prejudice to the possible obligation to report the event to the competent authorities and users concerned.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Voicemod is specifically subject to the European data protection legal framework and, in particular, to the GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), as well as to other applicable national and international regulations.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
