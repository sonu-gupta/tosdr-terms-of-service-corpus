<b>Uses of Information&nbsp;</b>
<br>
<br>
SurveyWriter is a web-based service for conducting surveys.
Any information shared with SurveyWriter&nbsp;<br>
during the creation of a survey is owned solely by the administrator of that survey.
By the nature or how&nbsp;<br>
our service works, surveys need to be shared via a URL on the Internet.
We provide the option to&nbsp;<br>
password protect your surveys if they contain sensitive content.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Email addresses uploaded to the system for the purpose of sending survey invitations and email&nbsp;<br>
communication are owned solely by the survey administrator.
We will never share any information&nbsp;<br>
uploaded to the system with any 3rd parties.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Data collected through surveys is owned solely by the survey administrator.
By default, the data is only&nbsp;<br>
accessible by providing a username and password and logging into the site.
There is the option to&nbsp;<br>
share online reports via a URL from the administrative account.
The survey administrator controls this&nbsp;<br>
option.
We will never use any of the data collected.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Communications from the Site</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Ongoing Communication and Product Updates&nbsp;</b>
<br>
<br>
We will occasionally send you information on product enhancements, new services, and additional&nbsp;<br>

These communications are designed to educate our users on the&nbsp;<br>
services offered.
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of&nbsp;<br>
communications.
Please see the 'Opt-out'.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Service-related Announcements&nbsp;</b>
<br>
<br>
We will send you strictly service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so.
For instance, if&nbsp;<br>
our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
Service-related&nbsp;<br>
emails are also sent confirming billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.
If you do&nbsp;<br>
not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel your account.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure&nbsp;</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Personally Identifiable Information Sharing with Partners&nbsp;</b>
<br>
<br>
If a user specifically requests a service from one of our partnering companies, their personally&nbsp;<br>
identifying information will be shared.
The partnering company may contact them directly regarding&nbsp;<br>
their inquiry.
Any requests of partnering companies are initiated solely by the user and it will be clearly&nbsp;<br>
indicated that a partnering company offers the requested service.
We reserve the right to disclose your&nbsp;<br>
personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary&nbsp;<br>
to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<b>Clear Gifs</b>&nbsp;<br>

of our marketing campaigns.

<b>Security&nbsp;</b>
<br>
<br>

No method of transmission over the Internet, or&nbsp;<br>
