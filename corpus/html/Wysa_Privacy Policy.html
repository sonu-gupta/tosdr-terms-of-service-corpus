<p>
</p>
<p> What Data do We collect and how do We Use it?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>How do We handle Your Personal Data?</strong>
</p>
<p>No identifiable information is solicited or stored in the Wysa app.
As data is not
related to an identifier or identifiable natural person, it will no longer be
Personal
data or Special Category of Personal data.
There is no user registration nor are You
asked to share Personal data when You install and use the Wysa App and Services.We
collect, transfer and securely store the unique vendor specific ID provided by the
Apple App Store or Android Play store when You install Wysa App on Your device.
This
is done for the purpose of generating a random pseudonymised user identifier.
This
pseudonymised identifier generated becomes the userId that is referred to for all
subsequent data transfers and linking Your data within the Wysa databases.
This
processing is based on Our Legitimate Interest.
Refer here to understand how
we protect Your data.
</p>
<p>
If Wysa App is integrated with Your Institution system, Your Institution may
securely share a unique random user identifier with Us.
This random identifier is
processed by Us on behalf of Your Institution for the purpose of accurately linking
You with Your provided data when You repeatedly access the Institution System and
the Wysa App and to provide the agreed analytics with Your Institution.
This processing will be based on Your Institutions contract
with Us.
</p>
<p>If You inadvertently share any personal identifier such as full name, dates,
locations,
phone numbers, email identifiers or medical terms during Your conversation with the
Wysa
App and Services, it is Our responsibility to redact such personal identifiers to
make
the data non-personal.
To ensure that no personal identifiers get stored in Our
systems,
We have developed a high recall AI-NLP algorithm that detects and irreversibly
redacts
identifiers, which include all numbers more than 2 digits, urls, emails, dates,
locations, names and medicalized terms, from Our storage systems.
Within 24 hours of
starting Your session, Our algorithms will process Your data, detect any personal
identifiers and irreversibly redact them.
None of Your conversation messages will be
lost, and only the specific personal identifier will be irreversibly redacted in Our
systems.
You can view
such
obfuscation in the Journey tab within the Wysa App.
This obfuscation processing is
based
on Our Legitimate Interest.
This is to ensure that no personal identifier and hence
no
Personal data inadvertently creeps into Our system and Wysa App is able to maintain
complete anonymity.
</p>
<p>You can always write to Us at the contact provided here.
if You want to
clarify, rectify or delete specific personal data that You shared with Us.
You can
also
read Your data protection rights here.<br>
</p>
<p>You have the Right to be Forgotten.
You can also, at any point of time, clear all
Your provided data by using the “reset my data” feature available in the Wysa App
settings.
Refer here in our Policy for more details.
DO NOTE THAT “RESET
MY DATA” DELETES ALL YOUR SUBMITTED DATA INCLUDING YOUR IDENTIFIERS, PAST
CONVERSATIONS, REMINDERS, ASSESSMENT RESPONSES AND ENABLED SETTINGS.
POST RESET, YOU
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER YOUR PAST DATA AND YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED AS A NEW USER
OF THE APP.
HENCE, THIS FEATURE IS TO BE USED BY YOU AT YOUR DISCRETION.

<p>
<strong>How do We handle Your conversation messages?</strong>
</p>
<p>When You Use the Wysa Bot Service, You provide Your messages by selecting
pre-formatted
options or by way of free-text using keypad or by speech to text.
We collect,
transmit and securely store Your messages in
Our servers.
We process Your messages in real-time using safe AI/NLP algorithms that
detect
the context and direct You appropriately to subsequent conversation based on a
proprietary rule-based content engine.
At no point during Your conversation with the
Wysa Bot does another natural person have access to or get to monitor or respond to,
Your messages.
The Wysa App’s proprietary and closed rule-based algorithms process
all
Your messages for positive and negative sentiments.
This is done to enable the Wysa
App
to empathetically converse with You, and personalize Your conversation.
There is no
solely automated processing done by the Wysa App to determine what You should do.
You
are always asked to verify whether the Wysa App has understood Your conversation or
sentiment or emotions correctly, before proceeding down the conversational path.
</p>
<p>When You use the Wysa Well-being Coach or Wysa Therapist Service, You get to exchange
text-based messages with a mental health and well-being professional.
We collect,
transmit and securely store these messages in Our servers.
If
You inadvertently send any Personal identifiers in Your messages, such
identifiers are irreversibly hashed by Your Well-being Coach or Wysa Therapist
during conversation.
</p>
<p>Processing of Your conversation messages is based on Our Agreement that You agree at
the
time of installing and using the Wysa App.<br>
</p>
<p>Your data, messages or usage is not used for direct marketing nor is it sold to
advertisers.
We do not use the messages or the data You submit to Us as a way to generate revenue
for
Wysa.
We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from You.
At the
same
time, We do use anonymised and only the minimal data that is required to answer the
research question for research and statistical purposes based on Our Legitimate
Interest
to improve Our Product and Services and contribute to the development of
user-centered
mental wellbeing best practices globally.
The messages You send are strongly
encrypted
during transmission and storage.
You can read more about the security provided here of this Privacy Policy.<br>
</p>
<p>
We also use anonymized and minimal conversation messages to tag, train and continually improve the performance of our rule-based AI/NLP algorithms.
This processing is based on Our Legitimate Interest to provide the Bot Service and to keep improving and/or optimizing quality, safety and performance of Our Service.
</p>
<p>You have the Right to be Forgotten.
You can also, at any point of time, clear all
Your
provided data by using the “reset my data” feature available in the Wysa App
settings.
Refer here in our Policy for more details.<br>
</p>

Touchkin has access to Your Data except to process based on Our Legitimate Interest as
identified here and based on principles of privacy by design and default.<br>

submitted by You as per Our Legitimate Interest.<br>

at any point of time during the conversation.

one time on-boarding process.

Processing of Your nickname is based on Our Agreement to help personalize Our
conversation with You.
We set character limits to prevent You from inadvertently
submitting Your full name.</p>

</p>
<p>When You Use the Service, You will be asked to respond to validated assessments.

is voluntary and You can opt to not report any of the assessments.
Wysa App currently
Uses four validated assessment scales for understanding Your emotional Well-being namely
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9)- <i>to self-report any symptoms of depression</i>,
the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD7) - <i>to self-report any symptoms of
anxiety</i>, and the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS)- <i>to self-report
the intensity of distress currently experienced</i>.</p>

If Wysa App is integrated with Your Institution system, Your Institution may additionally
share Your PHQ9 and GAD7 score, that Your Institution may collect, with Us.

data is processed by Us on behalf of Your Institution for the purpose of understanding Your
emotional Well-being, providing You the necessary Well-being tools and techniques and to
provide the agreed analytics with Your Institution.

be based on Your Institutions contract with Us.

assessments.

self-reported symptoms.

and used for the purpose of determining if escalation is required and to provide You
access to scientific-evidence based tools and techniques to manage emotions and
encourage mental well-being in a self-help context.</p>

OPINION NOR PROCESSED FOR ANY MEDICAL PURPOSES OR FOR GIVING CLINICAL ADVICE.
