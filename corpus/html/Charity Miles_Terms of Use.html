<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Welcome! You have arrived at Charity Miles (the “<strong>Application</strong>”), an application owned and operated by Charity Miles, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“<strong>Company</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”).</p>
<p>We know you are excited to walk, run and ride for charity, but it is important that you carefully read these Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”), as they govern your use of the Application and affect your legal rights and obligations.
Please also read our&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>, which describes how we may use certain information that we collect when you use the Application.</p>
<p>By accessing and using the Application, you agree to these Terms and consent to the Privacy Policy.
We think these Terms are better than fair.
And, as you can read in our Privacy Policy, we surely respect your privacy.
However, if you do not agree to be bound by all of these terms, or if you do not consent to the Privacy Policy, then please do not use the Application.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>How It Works</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Overview.&nbsp;</strong>This Application allows you to earn sponsorships on behalf of certain charities (each, a “<strong>Charity</strong>”) while walking, running, biking and participating in other activities (each, an “<strong>Activity</strong>”).
You are accessing this Application from an iPhone, Android phone or, possibly, some other device (each, a “<strong>Device</strong>”).
When you use the Application, we use your Device’s GPS and pedometer functionality to measure the distance of your Activity.
For every mile (or portion thereof) that you travel using the Application, you can earn money for a Charity.
Here’s how…</p>
<p>
<strong>Earning Sponsorships.
</strong>Subject to the terms herein, you can use the Application to earn money for the Charities featured in the Application.&nbsp.
To do so, you must record an Activity in the app by: (i) starting an Activity, (ii) moving at least one tenth of a mile, and then (iii) finishing and saving that activity.&nbsp.
So that we don't stream data (or drain your battery), we receive your miles only once you finish and save them, thereby sending them to our server.&nbsp.
If you do not finish and save your miles, then we cannot count them.</p>
<p>We are also working on features to enable you to record Activities in the Application by syncing the Application to certain fitness trackers.&nbsp.
When we have developed those features, we may update these terms accordingly.</p>
<p>The current Challenge Term (the “<strong>Challenge Term</strong>“) shall run from June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022.&nbsp.
For each calendar month during the Challenge Term (each, a “<strong>Challenge Month</strong>“), there shall be a monthly sponsorship pool <strong>(“Monthly Sponsorship</strong>
<strong>Pool</strong>“)&nbsp;equal to:</p>
<ul>
<li>10% of the first $100,000 of sponsorship revenue earned by the Company in that Challenge Month, plus</li>
<li>20% of the sponsorship revenue between $100,000 and $200,000 earned by the Company in that Challenge Month, plus</li>
<li>30% of the sponsorship revenue between $200,000 and $300,000 earned by the Company in that Challenge Month, plus</li>
<li>40% of the sponsorship revenue between $300,000 and $400,000 earned by the Company in that Challenge Month, plus</li>
<li>50% of the sponsorship revenue over $400,000 earned by the Company in that Challenge Month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note this sliding-scale Cap structure enables us to run our company sustainably while covering our low overhead and enabling our sponsorship to grow in proportion with our revenue.
It also enables us to pay out funds to the charities faster than we could under our old annual sponsorship pool, and better aligns our interests with those of our Charities and Members: the more revenue we earn, the more we can pay out.</p>
<p>For each Challenge Month, each Charity shall earn its&nbsp;<em>pro rata</em> share of the Monthly Sponsorship Pool, calculated as the product of: (i) the total Charity Miles (defined below) recorded by Members for the Charity in the applicable Challenge Month multiplied by (ii) the Monthly Sponsorship Pool.</p>
<p>For purposes of this calculation, a Charity's “<strong>Charity Miles</strong>” shall be equal to: (i) the total number of non-fraudulent miles walked for the Charity in the app, plus (ii) the total number of non-fraudulent miles run for the Charity in the app, plus (iii) 25% of the total number of non-fraudulent miles biked for the Charity in the app.</p>
<p>
<em>Important<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>The above calculations apply only to the funds raised for our Charities via our Monthly Sponsorship Pool.&nbsp.
It does not apply to any funds raised for our Charities via Peer-to-Peer fundraising, or via special challenges that we may feature in the app from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Peer-to-Peer Fundraising</strong>:&nbsp.
This Challenge Term we will also be introducing a new feature, in partnership with Blackbaud, Inc.
to enable our members, at their election, to earn sponsorships from their friends and family.&nbsp.
If a Member elects to participate in such peer-to-peer fundraising, they shall be able to create their own personal fundraising pages through which their friends and family can sponsor them.&nbsp.
Any donations made through those personal fundraising pages shall be processed by Blackbaud and sent directly to the applicable Charities.&nbsp.
These funds are not subject to our Monthly Sponsorship Pool, or any pro rata calculations described above.&nbsp.
To compensate for its services, Blackbaud takes an industry-standard fee of 5% of the funds donated through its fundraising pages.</p>
<p>
<strong>Special Challenges:</strong> This Challenge Term, we are also introducing a new feature that will enable us, from time to time, to promote special challenges (“<strong>Special Challenges</strong>“) in support of charities that are not subject to our Monthly Sponsorship Pools.&nbsp.
In these cases, the respective charity will have their own sponsor that is offering a unique sponsorship just for that charity.&nbsp.
The terms of each Special Challenge will be posted in the app on the card promoting it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cheating.&nbsp;</strong>The Application has fairly sophisticated algorithms to detect cheating.
So, if you cheat, it will probably be obvious to us and we reserve the right to disqualify any session that appears suspicious, with or without notice to you.
Of course, if you’re really determined to cheat, then we probably can’t stop you.
But if that’s the case, then you’ll just have to live with yourself as a cheater.
You’re on the honor system here.
So, please don’t cheat.</p>
