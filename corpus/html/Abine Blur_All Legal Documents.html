<em>Last revised 10/19/2020</em>
</p>
<p> This Privacy Policy describes how we deal with your personal information if you visit abine.com or use Blur.
This Privacy Policy does not address DeleteMe, joindeleteme.com, or other Abine products, services, or websites.
You can learn more about how we use and protect DeleteMe, joindeleteme.com, or other Abine products, services, or websites in the joindeleteme.com Privacy Policy or by contacting us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We never sell your data.
Period.</strong> If we share your data, it's only with companies we've hired to do work for us to carry out the services you want.
They'll never own it or be able to share it with anyone else.
Your data is yours.
We do sometimes place online advertisements or pay affiliate partners for subscription sales they generate.
These systems may use IP address or order numbers to identity and record these sales.
We do not share information beyond what is needed for these transactions, but some of these companies may already be tracking you outside of our control (for instance by clicking on a google search result).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Philosophy.</strong> We're dedicated to consumer privacy rights and support privacy policies that are understandable.
We're committed to responsibly handling any information we collect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data use.</strong> Many companies profit off their users by selling their information, but we'll never do that.
We only use the data we collect about the way people use our products and our website to build better products.
We'll never share any personal data about your online activity or use it to target you individually.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data sharing.</strong> A few things that you do may require us to share data.
For instance, when you buy one of our products with your credit card, we have to share that info to process the payment.
We try to do things ourselves but sometimes need to rely on external companies.
We make hard decisions about when to do so, always balancing the privacy risks against the benefits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Law enforcement.</strong> We won't provide your information unless we're compelled by law through a valid court order, which is a much higher standard than the usual "permitted by law" standard.
Companies don't have to tell you when someone requests your data, but we will try and inform you, if we are legally allowed to do so, so you can be aware and take legal action if you choose.
</p>
<p> As of today, Abine has <strong>not</strong> received a national security order and we have not been required by a FISA court to keep any secrets.
</p>
<p> Except as required by law, Abine, Inc.
<strong>will not share your data with third parties;</strong>
</p>
<p> Abine Inc.
will only retain user information for a maximum of <strong>6 months after a user has canceled a paid subscription</strong> (except for basic information that the transaction occurred), <b>and is no longer using our free service</b>, except for any payment-related information that we have to retain for fraud purposes.
</p> Abine.com Website Privacy Policy <p> Abine Inc.'s goal is to help you regain control of your personal information online, and as such, we do not use tracking to collect any personal information on our abine.com website.
Our privacy policy reflects this goal.
</p>
<p> We do not use persistent cookies generally on this site.
<em>The only time we use a persistent (i.e., non-session) cookie is when we deliver your download to you</em>.
<strong>We delete the cookie right after installation.</strong>
</p>
<p> We log aggregate information about our site visitors, but it does not contain your name, Email, or other personally-identifiable information.
These logs are automatically generated for all websites and are not powered by online trackers.
</p>
<p> We may use session cookies from time to time.
Session cookies expire when you close your browser.
You can set your browser to refuse cookies by following the instructions provided by your web browser.
</p>
<p> We won't share your data unless you are using specific services through us that require it or if we are ever compelled by legal orders, in which cases, we will share the minimum data required.
</p>
<p> We do not collect any personal information through the abine.com website.
Even so, abine.com is not directed at individuals under 13 years of age in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
</p>
<p> If you choose to sign up for our newsletters or to receive emailed updates of our privacy blog, we'll occasionally send you emails with coupons, announcements, and Abine news.
</p>
<p> We will sometimes link to other websites.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites before using them.
Our privacy policy does not apply to these other websites, and we cannot control their activities.
</p> Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.
Blur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) Privacy Policy <p> Abine Inc.
built Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.
Blur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) around the principle of letting users protect their privacy, so <strong>Blur &amp.
Blur Mobile do not try and track your personal data</strong>.
They have a limited ability to collect data about what sites you visit and web behavior such as what forms you interact with (or we autofill), but we only use this anonymized data to improve our form detection and filling capabilities.
</p>
<p> By default, Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.
Blur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) do not communicate with our servers except: 1) when getting new tracker-blocking rules or software versions, 2) obtaining updates to our form detection, 3) sending back form telemetry, such as form metadata, autofilled metrics, and any user-created crowdsourced form mappings.
The information sent to our servers is explicitly not tied to your account or other personal information.
<strong>You can also opt-out of this kind of data collection in the application's settings</strong>.
</p>
<p> There are a few limited pieces of information we need to know to make sound decisions about the business from Blur &amp.
Blur Mobile: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Information about your install of Blur &amp.
Blur Mobile</strong>, such as where you downloaded it, the original version you installed, the current version you have, and the month of your original install.
</li>
<li> Because there is a different version of Blur for each browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, IE), <strong>we know how many installs there have been for each browser</strong>.
</li>
<li> On a daily basis, <strong>we know how many users we have of Blur &amp.
Blur Mobile and whether those users are based in or outside the US</strong>.
</li>
<li> In order to improve our form detection capabilities, when you interact with forms <strong>we capture pieces of form meta-data and metrics</strong> such as if what we auto-filled into a form was then corrected by you.
This data collection is anonymized and explicitly not tied to your account information, and not received in real-time, only once a day.
</li>
<li> Lastly, <strong>we know how many visits to abine.com come from the Blur tool</strong>, but we do not know if any given add-on user clicked anything or other personal details.
</li>
<li> If you choose to interact with Blur &amp.
Blur Mobile to send us feedback, we may receive the following additional information that doesn't identify you: <strong>The description of the problem that you submit to us</strong> and <strong>the website URL and any trackers found on it</strong>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p> All of your personal Masked Email, Masked Phone, and Masked Card data is encrypted using industry standard 256-bit AES encryption.
The information is accessed by the client in real time when the information is needed.
</p>
<p> If you're using Blur &amp.
Blur Mobile Premium, we use specialty companies to process payments and phone calls and texts.
These service providers will have access to some of your data only to process it, but they'll never own it or share it with anyone else.
</p> MaskMe &amp.
MaskMe Mobile Privacy Policy <p> All of your accounts, passwords, and other browsing activity is stored locally in an encrypted database that we do not have the ability to decrypt.
It's encrypted using industry standard <strong>256-bit AES encryption</strong>.
If you choose to use the Sync feature to access your MaskMe data from any device, that means we're storing that data in an encrypted form on our servers - we can't read your passwords or see your accounts.
</p>
<p> If you're using MaskMe Premium, we use specialty companies to process payments and phone calls and texts.
These service providers will have access to some of your data only to process it, but they'll never own or share it with anyone else.

<strong>Here are the ground rules if you're using our stuff.</strong> The following Terms of Service (“Terms,” “Agreement”) govern your use of Abine, Inc.'s websites, products, applications, tools, and services (collectively referred to as our “Site and Services”).
</p>
<p>
<strong>We help protect your privacy.</strong> Our Site and Services allows a user ("user" or "you") to manage your online privacy and your personal information by controlling how other websites and businesses display or collect such personal information.
These Terms of Service describe the terms and conditions on which Abine provides our Site and Services to you.
For more information about how our products and services work, please visit our support page.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal policies can be tedious, but please read up.</strong> We'll strive to make our policies understandable.
READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
IF YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT OR USE OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITH ABINE.
THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT.
If you don't agree to these terms and conditions, you aren't permitted to use Abine's Site or Services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Things could change.</strong> We may amend or terminate any terms of this Agreement at any time and such amendment or termination will be effective at the time we post the revised terms on the site.
We'll strive to make these terms understandable.
You can tell when we last revised this agreement by looking at the “last revised” date at the top of this Agreement.
Your continued use of the site or services after we've posted revised terms signifies your acceptance of the revised terms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tell the truth (when we need you to).</strong> Some of Abine's products don't collect any of your personal information whatsoever, like Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe).
For others, like DeleteMe, we need some of your personal information to remove it from websites that display and sell it, and we need to know that it's actually yours.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We'll try hard.</strong> Abine's Services allow users and subscribers like you to seek greater control over your personal information online, including but not limited to by blocking software tracking.
requesting that third party websites, such as data brokers and information aggregators, remove or suppress your personal information from their websites.
forwarding safer, masked emails to your personal email account.
and encrypting and storing your logins and passwords.
You recognize that Abine will use good faith, reasonable efforts to help you accomplish these privacy goals, but that we cannot guarantee that third parties will honor the requests, remove your data, or devise new tracking technologies that we are not aware of, among other things.
We can't guarantee that this service will eliminate or control the collection, use, or sharing of your online data.
We don't provide legal advice, so please don't rely on our service for legal matters.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It's unlikely, but bad things could happen.</strong> You acknowledge that your use of the Abine Site and Services may have unintended consequences, possibly including direct, special, indirect, consequential and other damages, and you agree that you won't hold Abine liable for these consequences.
(Let's say you use MaskMe to securely store your logins and passwords, but you forget your master password and can't log in: you agree that you won't sue us because you can't retrieve that account information.) </p>
<p>
<strong>Don't sue us because of our products.</strong> You will indemnify and hold harmless Abine Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, customers, vendors, officers, and employees from any liability, damage or cost from any claim or demand associated with your use of our Site or Services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If something crazy happens, it's not our fault.</strong> You acknowledge that Abine will not be liable for any failure to comply with these Terms to the extent that such failure arises from factors outside Abine's reasonable control, like natural disasters.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy is key.</strong> Abine is dedicated to consumer privacy rights and operates our Site and Services under our privacy policy.
We urge you to read that policy now and revisit occasionally because we may update it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Please don't steal our stuff.</strong> All the text, images, marks, logos, compilations (meaning the collection, arrangement, and assembly of information) and other content on Abine's website ("Site Content"), and all software embodied in Abine's website, applications, or otherwise (“Software”) used by us to deliver the Services is proprietary to us.
Except as otherwise expressly permitted by these Terms, any use, redistribution, sale, decompilation, reverse engineering, disassembly, translation, or other reduction of such software to human-readable form is prohibited.

Any use of such marks will apply to the benefit of their respective owners.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Use our tools and services for good, not evil, or we'll kick you out.</strong> We don't allow our Site or Services to be used for illegal activities or activities that we find improper for any reason whatsoever.
We reserve the right to take preventative or corrective actions to protect ourselves and our users from anyone's unacceptable use.
Your failure to comply with our Terms may result in us terminating your access to and use of our site and services.
You are not to: </p>
<ul>
<li> Impersonate anyone, falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity, or knowingly provide any fraudulent, misleading, or inaccurate information.
</li>
<li> Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten, or otherwise violate others' rights, including without limitation others' privacy rights or rights of publicity.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Data collectors and trackers change, so our services will change too.</strong> You acknowledge that our privacy services often include our blocking or interacting with third parties like advertisers, and that therefore our services will evolve when these third parties' methods and processes change.
For example, the online trackers our software blocks change as advertisers develop new tracking techniques and form new companies.
for DeleteMe, our removal list depends on the listed websites' opt-out procedures and business practices and thus is subject to change.
DeleteMe will not remove all of your information from the Internet and Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) will not block every single attempt to track your personal information.
As such, the DeleteMe service, content and site are provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
Consistent with what we stated above regarding damages, you agree that in any event, Abine's liability is limited to fees you actually paid to Abine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We'll charge you for your paid subscriptions.</strong> If you're using one of our paid products, you acknowledge that you're registering for a recurring subscription and will be automatically billed at the end of the subscription billing cycle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You can cancel your paid subscriptions at any time.</strong> You have the right to cancel your premium subscriptions at any time, for any reason, and can do so by emailing us or calling us at 800-928-1987.
If you choose to cancel your Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe)/Blur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) or MaskMe/MaskMe Mobile premium subscription, you will not be charged for any billing period beyond the one in which you canceled.
This refund policy does not apply if we've terminated your account for misuse outlined in this Agreement.
Any termination of your use of our services, whether initiated by you or by Abine, won't affect any of your or Abine's rights and obligations under these Terms that have arisen before the effective date of such termination.
</p>
<p>
<strong> Try us out for 14 days.
</strong> We offer a 14 day calendar grace period for Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.
Blur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile).
If within the 14 day period you decide that Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) or Blur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) are not the product for you, you can cancel for a full refund.
After the expiration of the 14 calendar day grace period all sales are final.
We do not offer a refund after the expiration of the 14 calendar grace period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We're from Massachusetts, so that's where we'll go to court if we ever get on each other's nerves.</strong> You and Abine Inc.
agree that all matters arising from or relating to the use and operation of our site or services will be governed by the substantive laws of Massachusetts.
You agree that all claims you may have arising from or relating to the operation, use, or other exploitation of Abine's Site or Services will be heard and resolved in the federal and state courts located in Massachusetts.

For more information about how our products and services work, please visit www.abine.com/support.</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal policies can be tedious, but please read up</strong>.
We'll strive to make our policies understandable.
READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
IF YOU USE MASKED CARDS, YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITH ABINE.
THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT.
If you don't agree to these terms and conditions, you aren't permitted to use Masked Cards.</p>
<p>
<strong>Things could change</strong>.
We may amend or terminate any terms of this Agreement at any time, and that amendment or termination will be effective at the time we post the revised terms on the site.
You can tell when we last revised this agreement was by looking at the “last revised” date at the top of this Agreement.
Your continued use of Masked Cards after we've posted revised terms signifies your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>How Masked Cards work</strong>.
.
Masked Card Solutions let you shop online more safely by letting you ("user" or "you") access and facilitate a payment using Masked Cards exclusively with the MCS software: a browser add-on and a web/mobile application.
You obtain access to the Masked Cards features by registering to use one of our “Masked Card Solutions” and, typically, fees are charged to the personal credit card you provide upon signup (your “Personal Credit Card”) or other Funding Sources you may have added.
When you're shopping online at a retailer (“retailer,” “merchant”), you can choose to pay for products or services with a Masked Card during checkout by specifying the monetary amount of your purchase.
The Funding Source associated with your account will be charged the amount you specify.
The retailer will see only the Masked Credit Card number.</p>
<p>You can view transaction details for all your Masked Cards from within MCS products such as Blur &amp.
MaskMe by clicking on the Masked Cards icon, then clicking “view details” next to the Masked Card you wish to examine.</p>
<p>
<strong>Key characteristics of Masked Cards</strong>.
You're buying the right to access Abine's credit line in the amount you specify for the Masked Cards you create.
As such, you'll see “Abine, Inc.” listed on your Personal Credit Card statement as the merchant, even though you'll spend the Masked Cards at other retailers.</p>
<p>
<strong>Masked Cards need to be at least $10 in value, but no more than $500.</strong> They are assigned an expiration date when you create them.
Masked Cards you create are issued by our bank partner as MasterCard numbers.
Masked Cards are usable until their balance reaches zero, they expire, or you deactivate them.
Abine reserves the right to change limits globally or for specific uses at any time and for any reason including suspicious activity.</p>
<p>
<strong>Who gets your Personal Credit Card</strong>.
When you use a Masked Card to purchase something from a merchant, that merchant will not see or have access to your Personal Credit Card.
Abine uses a payments processor to process payments.
When you sign up for one of our Masked Card Services or add money to a Masked Card, you're billed through our payment processor.
Our payments processor stores or has access to your Personal Credit Card, but Abine, our bank partner, and MasterCard do not.</p>
<p>For more details about the privacy of your personal information when you use Abine products, services, or websites, please visit our privacy policy at www.abine.com/legal.html.</p>
<p>
<strong>Credit card authorizations</strong>.
As soon as the merchant where you use a Masked Card runs an authorization, that money is held on your Masked Card and can't be used (it will show up as "pending" to you when you view transaction details on a Masked Card).
For some authorizations, merchants might add an additional percentage hold on top of the purchase value (for example, 20% for a restaurant).</p>
<p>
<strong>ACH Authorization</strong>.
When you use your bank account as your Payment Method for any transaction or to fund Masked Cards, you are requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.
For these transactions, Abine will make electronic transfers via ACH from your bank account in the amount specified by your or Abine (in the case of subscription payments).
You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to Abine.
to make the transfers.
Once you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer.</p>
<p>
<strong>Chargebacks and disputes with merchants</strong>.
You understand and agree that Abine is not responsible for the goods or services that you pay for using a Masked Card.
Each seller that you purchase from is responsible for providing the goods and services that you purchase and for providing all customer service related to those goods and services.
We recommend that you review a seller's policies before completing your purchase.
You are responsible for resolving any disputes that you may have with a seller.
If you have exhausted all options for resolving a dispute with a seller, you may choose to file a dispute through Abine (see “How to file a Dispute” below).</p>
<p>Disputing a charge from Abine on your bank statement that is related to a Masked Card purchase is filing a dispute against Abine, Inc.
and will not only damage your relationship with Abine, but will not resolve any dispute with the seller of the item purchased with a Masked Card.
Abine is the “issuing bank” for purchases completed with a Masked Card.
If you file a Chargeback against Abine that Abine contests and wins (i.e.
you lose the Chargeback) you will be charged a $25 chargeback processing fee.
There is no chargeback processing fee if you win a contested Chargeback.</p>
<p>
<strong>Release of Abine, Inc.</strong> By filing a Dispute, you understand and agree that: </p>
<ul>
<li>You are asking Abine to assist in resolving the dispute in its sole discretion and that such assistance or Abine's decision may not be satisfactory to you.
</li>
<li>Abine's assistance in resolving the dispute does not guarantee any particular outcome nor any action on Abine's part.
and </li>
<li>You release Abine and our officers, directors, agents, employees, and suppliers from all claims, demands, and damages of any kind arising out of your dispute with a seller and Abine's review of your Dispute.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>How to file a Dispute</strong>.
To file a Dispute, follow these steps: </p>
<ul>
<li>Within 60 days of the original transaction, email blur-support@abine.com with the following information: </li>
<li>The last 4 digits of the Masked Card used for the related purchase.</li>
<li>The name of the merchant/seller involved.</li>
<li>A description of the goods or services purchased.</li>
<li>The amount of the transaction.
and</li>
<li>The details of your disagreement with the recipient, including any steps already taken to resolve the issue and copies of supporting documentation (such as email correspondence, receipts, shipping confirmations, etc.) </li>
<li>Provide any additional information or documentation that we may request.

You are required to comply with the decision and complete any actions required by such decision.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<strong>It's your responsibility to ensure there's sufficient balance on your Masked Cards</strong>.
Be careful if you use a Masked Card for recurring charges, like a subscription.
For recurring charges, it's your responsibility to ensure that there is enough value and time expiration on the Masked Card you're using.
We are not liable if the Masked Card gets declined and you lose access to a recurring service.
We aren't responsible for any late fees, service terminations, or other problems that arise because of declined transactions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Authorization to recover amounts due</strong>.
If a Masked Card is overdrawn (i.e.
the total amount of any transactions posted to a Masked Card is greater than the original Masked Card value), or the charge to fund a successfully used Masked Card fails to process, you authorize Abine and our Financial Institution Partners to take any of the following actions to recover the remaining amounts from you: </p>
<ul>
<li>Debit the credit/debit card or bank account linked to your paid subscription.</li>
<li>Debit any of your other Masked Cards with a remaining balance</li>
<li>Suspend your paid subscription and require your immediate payment.
or</li>
<li>Engage in collection efforts.</li>

Users can pay via another ACH transfer, or place a credit card on file to pay off the balance more quickly.</p>
<p>
<strong>You cannot sell or transfer a Masked Card to anyone else</strong>.
A Masked Card can only be used by you or someone you authorize.
If you authorize anyone else to use a Masked Card you create, you are responsible for all transactions made by that person.</p>

Masked Cards typically require a subscription to a Masked Card Service operated by Abine.
(Currently this is a $39 annual/$59 biennial/$79 triennial fee for Blur plus the cost of any purchases you make using a Masked Card.) Any time you make a purchase with a Masked Card by inputting the monetary value of that purchase, you're authorizing Abine to charge your Funding Method in that amount.</p>
<p>
<strong>There may be a charge to create a Masked Card.</strong> If you are using a Credit Card as the Funding Source for your Masked Card then you may incur a service fee beyond that of the Masked Card amount.
Service Fees per the Schedule of Fees will be charged to the same Funding Source as was used to create the Masked Card or to any other Funding Source you might have.
Fees can be changed at any time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Open Masked Cards will incur a Monthly Fee.</strong> After 30 days from the date the Masked Card was created, Masked Card you have that is open with a remaining balance will be charged a service fee (see below for current fees).
This will not be charged to your Funding Source, but will instead be withdrawn from remaining balance of the related Masked Card.
If there is an insufficient amount on the Masked Card to cover the monthly fee, it will be charged the remaining balance and the Masked Card will be closed.
If a Masked Card is used for a successful transaction within the 30 day period, it will not incur this monthly fee.</p>
<strong>Schedule of Fees</strong> Fee Using a Personal Credit Card as a Funding Source $2 per card for cards under $100.
An additional 1.5% of the Masked Card Amount for cards made for $100 or more Using ACH as a Funding Source for Masked Cards $1 per card Masked Card service fee (every 30 days after card creation).
Not applicable to residents of Connecticut and New Jersey.
$5.95 Refund fee (refunding balance on a Masked Card to Funding Source such as a Personal Credit Card) Free Chargeback loss processing fee.

$25 <br>
<p>
<strong>Refunding Masked Cards</strong>.
Masked Cards have an expiration date.
If the Masked Card expires or if you deactivate it, any funds you've placed on it less any purchases or other fees will be automatically refunded to your Funding Method on or around the Masked Card's expiration date or the date of deactivation.
If your billing or contact information is incorrect or out of date, we may not be able to issue an automatic refund and will try to contact you to refund you.
If we're unsuccessful, applicable law may require us to report the balance on the Masked Card as unclaimed property, and we may be required to deliver any value remaining on it to the state as unclaimed property.</p>
<p>
