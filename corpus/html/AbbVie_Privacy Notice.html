How we may use Personal Data through online interactions <p>In addition to the uses described separately in this Privacy Notice, we may use your Personal Data collected online for the additional purposes as described in this section.</p> &nbsp.
Customized user experiences <p>We may use your IP address and the Personal Data that we obtain automatically through the use of cookies or similar tracking technologies to make our websites and mobile applications easier for you to use and navigate, to assist in your registrations and login, to personalize the content by anticipating the information and services that may be of interest to you, and to personalize and improve our interactions with you by making the information we provide more relevant to you.
We may also add your website usage data to the general profile we maintain about you so that our AbbVie Relationships with you are a more personalized experience.
When we send email communications, we may place a web beacon or similar tracking technology in the email to know whether your device is capable of receiving HTML emails, or to collect data on whether the email or an attachment or link in the email has been opened.&nbsp;&nbsp.
We use this data to help us determine and document if a particular part of our communication was more relevant to you.</p>
<p>In some cases, we collect this Personal Data with your consent.
In other cases, we collect this information for our legitimate business interest to optimize and customize your user experience.</p> &nbsp.
Digital analytics and improvement <p>We may use the Personal Data that you provide to us and the online information we collect automatically through cookies and similar tracking technologies to monitor user traffic patterns and preferences.&nbsp.
We may also track email communications through web beacons or similar tracking technology in emails to create aggregated statistics and reports to analyze the effectiveness of and improve our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>We collect this information for our legitimate business interests of security, improvement, analytics and optimization of AbbVie Relationships</p> &nbsp.
Social Media Analysis <p>We may also analyze public sources, such as websites and social media channels, to monitor, analyze and improve our understanding of interactions with and views of our products, services, and events.
AbbVie and its service providers will respect the privacy notices and terms of use applicable to such sources in performing such activities.</p> &nbsp.
Tell-A-Friend Functions <p>We may offer “tell-a-friend” functionality on our sites.&nbsp.
If you choose to use this function, we will collect your friend’s contact information.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email with the information you specified or inviting your friend to visit the site.
We use this Personal Data you provide us as part of the “tell-a-friend” functionality for the sole purposes of sending this one-time email.</p> &nbsp.
How your Personal Data may be shared through online interactions <p>In addition to the types of disclosures of Personal Data described separately in this Privacy Notice, we may share Personal Data online for the additional purposes as described in this section.</p> &nbsp.
Third-party advertising and online behavioral advertising <p>We may provide you with online advertisements for AbbVie products and services on third-party websites and mobile services that are tailored to you, which may be based on the Personal Data that you provide to us or to a third-party website that you are visiting, or on your browsing activity, purchases, or interests.
We may share some of your device information with our advertising service providers that we have obtained from cookies and other data-collection and tracking technologies based on your AbbVie Relationships.<br>
</p>
<p>Some AbbVie Relationships participate in online behavioral advertising (this is also sometimes called targeted advertising or interest-based advertising).
You can identify these sites by the “Advertising Choices” link in the advertisement.&nbsp.
Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on our websites and on other third-party sites to collect Personal Data about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests.
When an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an “Ad Choices” icon.
Clicking on the icon or link will take you to a website where you can manage or opt-out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements.
If you opt-out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior clickstream activity).
In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior.
You can also opt-out now by clicking&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>You may also opt out of certain online behavioral advertising on the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance's consumer choice tool, and the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative’s tool.</p>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to web services with which your browser communicates.
As of the effective date of this Privacy Notice, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals.
therefore, AbbVie does not currently respond to these signals.
However, you can opt-out from advertisers that use your browsing history to deliver online behavioral advertisements via the mechanisms listed above.</p> &nbsp.
Links to third-party sites and social media plug-ins <p>This Privacy Notice only applies to AbbVie Relationships linked to this Privacy Notice and does not apply to third-party websites to which AbbVie Relationships may link, including links to outside websites or advertisements from third parties.
We encourage you to review the privacy statements provided by all third parties prior to providing them with Personal Data.</p>
<p>AbbVie Relationships may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button and the “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others.&nbsp;When you visit our sites as part of an AbbVie Relationship, the operator of the social plug-in and integrated social media platforms can place a cookie on your device that enables that operator to receive your Personal Data that allow the operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our sites.&nbsp.
If you are logged into the social media site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our site, the social media plug-in allows that social media site to receive information that you have visited our site.
The social media plug-in also allows the social media site to share information about your activities on our site with other users of that social media site.
These sharing&nbsp;settings are managed by the social media site, and you should refer to those sites’ privacy policies for information about their privacy and data-sharing practices.</p>

</p> &nbsp.
Additional information for California residents <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights with respect to AbbVie’s use and disclosure of your Personal Data.
Those California-specific privacy requirements not addressed in other Privacy Notice sections are described here.</p>
<p>Consistent with the collection practices described in this Privacy Notice, we may collect certain categories and specific pieces of Personal Data either from your or from other third parties.
We collect, use, and disclose Personal Data for our business and commercial purposes described in this Privacy Notice.&nbsp.
AbbVie does not sell Personal Data.&nbsp.
Furthermore, AbbVie receives, and may further share with its collaborators and partners, deidentified health data from health care providers and health plans, subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).
The health data received by AbbVie was deidentified based on either HIPAA’s “safe harbor” method, which means that certain direct identifiers were removed from the health data, or HIPAA’s expert determination method, which means that a qualified statistician reviewed the health data shared with AbbVie and confirmed that there is a very small risk that an individual could be identified from the remaining health data.</p>
<p>As a California resident, you have the right to request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about the Personal Data that AbbVie has collected, used, and disclosed about you over the previous 12 months.
This includes:<ul>
<li>the categories of Personal Data collected</li>
<li>the categories of sources from which your Personal Data was collected</li>
<li>the business or commercial purposes for which AbbVie collected your Personal Data</li>
<li>the categories of your Personal Data that was disclosed for a business or commercial purpose</li>
<li>the categories of third parties with whom AbbVie shared your Personal Data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The specific Personal Data that AbbVie has collected about you over the previous 12 month.</li>
<li>To have your Personal Data deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you exercise any of your privacy rights as a California resident, AbbVie will not discriminate against you by offering you different pricing or products, or by providing you with a different level or quality of products, based solely upon this request.
However, certain AbbVie Relationships may require your consent to have your Personal Data shared with AbbVie to provide the service or to allow us to use and disclose your Personal Data to provide the AbbVie Relationships.
When you exercise your deletion right, you may lose access to certain aspects of AbbVie Relationships that require your Personal Data to perform the service.</p>
<p>Please see the&nbsp;Your privacy rights and choices&nbsp.
section if you or your authorized representative have questions or would like to make a request to exercise any of your rights described in this section.
After you make your request, we will use the information we have to verify your identify (and if applicable, your authorized agent’s identify), and to match the Personal Data we have collected about you, if any, to your verified identify.&nbsp.
Our verification process may include a request for additional information to confirm your identify or your authorized agent’s identify, or to obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf.
If our verification process is successful, we will respond to your request within the time and in the manner required by applicable law.
If we cannot validate the identify of you and/or your authorized agent or obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf, we will attempt to contact you to inform you.</p>
