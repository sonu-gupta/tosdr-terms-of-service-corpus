<strong>FANDANGO MOBILE TICKETS</strong>
</p>
<p>Rather than bringing a Print-at-Home Bar-Coded Ticket or confirmation number to the theater, some of Fandango's exhibitor partners give you the option of having your ticket delivered to your mobile device as a picture message (a "Mobile Ticket").
The Mobile Ticket contains a unique barcode and some accompanying text with details of the movie you are going to see.
If you have questions about the purchase or use of the Mobile Ticket, please see the Fandango Mobile Ticket Delivery FAQ.
Please note that Mobile Tickets are not available for MovieTickets.com mobile applications.</p>
<p>Your purchase of a Mobile Ticket will be deemed your agreement to the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Message and data rates may apply and, if so, are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider.</li>
<li>The Mobile Ticket is in the form of a unique barcode sent as a text message to your mobile device or delivered on the confirmation page from the Fandango Movies - Times &amp.
Tickets Mobile App.
The barcode and any accompanying text sent to you by Fandango is the entire ticket, and not the barcode in isolation from the accompanying text.
Accompanying text includes any text stating the originating source of the barcode.
Any barcode with non-original text is invalid.</li>
<li>The Mobile Ticket barcode cannot be forwarded to anyone else.
Doing so invalidates your Mobile Ticket without the right to a refund.</li>
<li>If you purchase multiple tickets in a single order, your Mobile Ticket holds all of those tickets, and all of your guests must arrive at the same time to gain entry using your Mobile Ticket.</li>
<li>Fandango is not responsible for lost or stolen Mobile Tickets, except as required by law.
Anyone attempting to gain entry with a Mobile Ticket reported lost or stolen, or cancelled for any other reason, may be reported to the authorities and may have their mobile device withheld as evidence.</li>

Fandango, pursuant to the Act, reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate your license to use the Services if it determines in its sole and absolute discretion that you are involved in infringing activity, including alleged acts of first-time or repeat infringement, regardless of whether the material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.
Therefore, in compliance with the Act, if you believe that any such third party materials infringe your intellectual property rights, please send a notice to the agent identified below to request a review of the alleged infringement.
The notice must include the following information (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

ARBITRATION <p>
<strong>BINDING ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us.
Therefore, pursuant to these Terms, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding or relating to (i) your use of or interaction with the Services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with Fandango, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to Fandango or that Fandango may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction(collectively, "Fandango Transactions or Relationships"), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration.
By using or interacting with the Services, or engaging in any other Fandango Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.
Our rights and obligations under this arbitration provision shall inure to the benefit of each of Fandango's Owners (as defined in the Privacy Policy regardless of whether any of them are named as aco-defendant with us or named individually in a claim that would otherwise be subject to this arbitration provision if brought against us.</strong>
</p>
<p>We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us.
If those efforts fail, by using our Services, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against Fandango, and any claim that Fandango may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with our Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, our Terms andPolicies, or any Fandango Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration ("Arbitration") administered by JAMS or its successor ("JAMS") and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the "Applicable Rules").
The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com.
If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the "AAA") instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the "Applicable Rules" in such circumstances).
If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, Fandango agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth herein, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below.
Furthermore, nothing herein shall prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
You further agree that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and Fandango (the "Arbitrator");</li>
<li>the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and/or these arbitration provisions hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable;</li>
<li>the Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business).
or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and Fandango.
or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.</li>
<li>the Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the United States, irrespective of any conflict of law principles.
(ii)shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable.
(iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.
and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;</li>
<li>the Arbitration can resolve only your and/or Fandango's individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;</li>
<li>the Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator's complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an "Award").
Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;</li>
<li>in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Fandango will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;</li>
<li>in the event you recover an Award greater than Fandango's last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award Fandango's reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees associated with the Arbitration, but Fandango shall in all events bear its own attorneys' fees.
and</li>
<li>with the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, subpart (e)is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Fandango shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Fandango may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty(30) days after Fandango has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from Fandango Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against Fandango in your local small claims court within the United States, if your claim is within such court's jurisdictional limit.
provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.</li>
