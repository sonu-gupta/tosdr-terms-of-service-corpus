</ul> About this Privacy Policy <p>At Wakelet, the privacy of you and your students is very important to us.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell any personal information to advertisers or third parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We only share data with third parties when necessary to provide and improve the service - never for advertising or to monetize that data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated in our terms and conditions, Wakelet does use your personal information for certain stated purposes, such as providing and improving the service and communicating with Registered Users (but not anonymous users).
</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy below describes what information we collect from you, how we use that information, and the legal basis we have to process your information.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs how Wakelet Limited (“we” or “us”) a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with company number 07483296 and with its registered office and main trading address at Wakelet, Bright Building, Manchester Science Park, Pencroft Way, Manchester M15 6GZ, United Kingdom uses and shares personal information collected by our website at Wakelet.com, the Wakelet mobile app, and any associated services and content (the “Service”).
We are the data controller in respect of any information we collect about you on or through Wakelet.</p>
<p>This policy only applies to us and to our Agents and how we will use your personal information.
Please be aware that once personal information has been posted on Wakelet this will be visible to the public (unless you tell us that you do not want it to be publicly available) and we cannot control what other Wakelet users do with any information you share on or through Wakelet.
Be careful with your own information and what you are willing to share.
</p>
<p>The Definitions at the end of this Policy set out the meaning of any capitalised words used in this Policy.
</p> 1.
Wakelet is a Public Platform.
<p>Wakelet is for both public and private use.
Whenever you add Content through Wakelet that is not created as a private display it will be public, and when you provide us with User Content or make User Comments on a non-private collection it is published so that anyone can view it.</p>
<p>Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that Content.
In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through features native to Wakelet Services, such as commenting and embedding.
If you are a teacher or parent who is using Wakelet with or for children under the age of 13, then you should ensure that you have selected the privacy controls available to you.
If we become aware that children are posting content on Wakelet that is publicly accessible, then we can require verifiable parent or teacher consent as a condition to continue public access or, in the absence of such consent, convert the postings to private use.</p> 2.
Information Wakelet Collects and how it is used <p>Wakelet may collect personal information from Registered Users as described below.
</p> 2.1 Registered User Account Information <p>When a Registered User creates an account on the Service, we ask you to provide your email address and password, or to authenticate yourself through a third-party service, like Facebook.
When you authenticate through another site, that account is linked to your Wakelet account.
Once linked, we may collect and store personally identifying information that you have provided to that third-party service, and consented to having shared with services like us (please see section 4.2).
Information gathered includes your name, email address, avatar, and public data.</p>
<p>We will store the email address and password that you provided to create your Wakelet Account and any information you or we add to your Wakelet account, including your name, handle, bio, profile image and any links you choose to add to your Wakelet account.
Where you use a third-party site to authenticate your Wakelet account, we do not receive or store passwords for your linked accounts.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we might need to use your email address to send you important information about our Services.
We might need to send you some administrative information, tell you something important about your account or changes to our Services, or update you on new policies or terms.
These administrative communications are considered part of our Services and your Wakelet account.</p> 2.2 Third Party Site Information <p>When you link your Wakelet account to a third-party service account, we may receive your biographical information (birthday, education and similar information particular to you) or your geographic location from that third-party service (if you have provided that information to the service and made it available for Wakelet to access).</p>
<p>We may store and use this information to improve and personalise Wakelet and make suggestions to you about Content and Users that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>You should take care when linking with a third-party service account that you have checked (using that service’s settings) that you are comfortable with the information that they will share with us.
As a general practice, we strongly urge you to make careful judgements about any personal information you disclose to Internet services, including Wakelet and any third-party services you link to us.
</p> 2.3 Communications with Us <p>If you contact us, or we contact you, with any query or comment about Wakelet or your use of Wakelet, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
</p> 2.4 Surveys and Market Research <p>We may ask you to complete surveys in connection with your Wakelet Account where we may receive your name, email address, account use information and opinions.

We use your IP address only for the purpose of displaying the relevant collection to you.
</p> 2.6 Information relating to User Content <p>In some cases, we may collect information by analysing your User Content.
We may do this where you upload a link to Wakelet, by analysing the content of any such link and determining its broad subject matter (for example, sports, music, technology, science etc.) This allows us to improve our Services by enhancing your ability to organise content, search topics of interest, and generally provide additional features and functionality.
</p> 2.7 Information Relating to Your Use of Wakelet <p>We collect information about how you use Wakelet, whether you are a Registered User or User.

</p>
<p>We will use this information to help improve the Service.
We will also use this information to identify Content that you are likely to be interested in or to suggest Content and Users that we think may be of interest to you (both on Wakelet and by email).
</p> 2.8 Location Information <p>In some cases, we collect and store information about where you are located by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation.
We may use location information to improve and personalise the Service for you by finding and presenting Content to you that we think will be of interest to you based on your location, for example news stories or topics of interest similar to those you post.
</p> 2.9 Information Collected through Email Tracking <p>To measure the deliverability and interest of our emails for Registered Users, we may embed information, such as a web beacon or tag, in them.
This allows us to see which of our emails you have read and clicked-through from so that we can analyse the effectiveness of our communications and seek to make them more relevant for you in the future.</p> 2.10 Cookies and Similar Technologies <p>Wakelet uses cookies (small text files placed on your device’s hard disk) and similar technologies to provide the Service, to better understand how you interact with Wakelet, to monitor aggregate usage by our Users and Registered Users and web traffic routing on Wakelet, and to customise and improve Wakelet.
Our cookies, both session cookies and persistent cookies, do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you.
</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.
You can instruct your browser – by changing its settings – to stop accepting cookies, or to prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you visit.
However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of Wakelet.

Information Security <p>All information provided to us is stored on our secure servers.
Where we have given you (or you have chosen) a password to access certain parts of Wakelet, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and not sharing it with anyone.
It’s important for you to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by choosing and protecting a strong third-party service password and by limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished using Wakelet.
We will never email you to ask for your password or other Account Information.
if you receive such an email, send it to us so that we can investigate and take any appropriate action.
</p>
<p>We have put appropriate security measures in place to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your personal data to only those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
They will only process your personal information under our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data breach and will notify you, and any applicable regulator, of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
</p>
<p>If Wakelet becomes aware of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party or that any user data was used for an unauthorized purpose, we will comply with relevant state and other data breach laws.
We will notify users of any breach resulting in unauthorized release of data electronically within 72 hours, at minimum, and without unreasonable delay so that you can take appropriate steps.
The notification will include: date of the breach, the types of information that were subject to the breach, general description of what occurred, and steps Wakelet is taking to address the breach.</p> 5.1 Where We Store Your Personal Data <p>Some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
</p>
<p>Where we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is given to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission that give personal information the same protection it has in Europe </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer information to them if they have agreed to the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US</p>
</li>
</ul> 6.
Data Retention <p>We store the information we collect only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
</p>
<p>We store the information we collect from Registered Users for as long as you have an Account and for 14 days thereafter.
After this time, it will be purged from our data store and caches.

</p> 8.
Marketing <p>We will only send you marketing emails about collections, Users and Content we think may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Wakelet does not send you marketing communications about third-party products or services.
Users may display any content, including advertising, so long as it does not conflict with our Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>You can ask us to stop sending you these emails at any time by using the “Unsubscribe” link in each email.</p>
<p> If you do unsubscribe, we will still use your information to present Content on Wakelet, which we think will be of interest to you, but will not send you messages about these.</p> 9.

You can log in to Wakelet and visit your account settings page or email us at admin@wakelet.com to exercise your rights at any time.
</p>
<p>We cannot delete your personal information without deleting your user account.
We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
</p>
<p>If you delete your User Content from Wakelet or request we do so, please note that User Content might have been copied or stored by other users.
</p>
<p>If you want to delete your user account, you can do this in your account settings page.
Given the sharing, commenting, and dialogue that takes place on Wakelet, some of the public activity on your account prior to deletion may have been copied to third-party servers outside of our control and so may remain accessible to the public indefinitely.
</p> 10.
COPPA and Students <p>You must be over the age of 13 to be a Registered User of Wakelet.
</p>
<p>Children under 13 years of age may only use Wakelet under the supervision of a responsible adult (over the age of 18) who has agreed to our Terms and the provisions in respect of their responsibilities as a ‘Group Registered User’.
We do not send any marketing messages or advertising targeting children under the age of 13.
In order to create an account in Wakelet we require every user to verify that they are not under 13 years of age, and we do not permit children under the age of 13 to create an account.</p>
<p>Teachers can invite students under the age of 13 to contribute to their collections through our ‘Collaboration’ feature.
These students can identify themselves by their first or given name or a nickname only visible to their teacher and other contributors to the collection.
The use of a surname or family name is not required for registration.
We do not require contributors using ‘Collaboration’ to provide their name, address or other contact information.
We hold no personal information on these Users other than what is necessary to provide the service.
If we have verifiable parental consent a family name will be permitted.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
If you are a student under the age of 13 you may use the interactive or public comment features of Wakelet, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address or username only if we have verifiable parental or teacher consent.
We do not monitor or review content created by any user and we do not control the actions of third parties with whom a child may share information.
A parent or teacher may request us to delete a child’s PII of which he or she becomes aware.
</p>
<p>We expect that use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials.
Further, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Service if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in our Rules, Terms and this Privacy Policy.
We encourage parents to educate their children about safety online and to carefully monitor their children's use of social features to ensure they do not disclose their personal information through them.
</p>
<p>In the United States, if you are a Group Registered User, including a School that is using Wakelet, that includes children under the age of 13, you (or your school) assumes the responsibility for complying with the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”).
This means that the Group Registered User must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before using the Service with students.
Schools may, under appropriate circumstances, provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians.
For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy.coppafaqs.shtm</p>
<p>If you are outside of the United States, please ensure that you are complying with any laws applicable to you before using Wakelet with students.
</p>
<p>If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@wakelet.com If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.
To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to take certain steps or provide additional information to verify your identity before we provide any information or make corrections.</p> Spaces <p>Spaces is an additional built-in feature of Wakelet which provides a streamlined way to organize a collection, Learning Project, Research Project or create any Spaces for the purpose of formulating rich content in an online environment.</p>
<p>A teacher may create Spaces for a Classroom and would invite Students to participate in the Wakelet Spaces feature.
Students would be able to create their own collections for the classroom with the supervision of the Teacher.</p>
<p>Students may be invited to join as a member of a Spaces Classroom by the teacher in one of the two methods described below:</p>
<p> 1) The Teacher can provide a link to join by sharing this with the Student through a Student/Parent email account.
</p>
<p>2) The Teacher can provide a Spaces (Classroom) Code to the Student/Parent by an in-Class Slip or an Email Account of the Student/Parent.</p>
<p>Once the Student has joined and become a member of the Spaces Classroom, the Teacher will be involved in the creation of the Classroom Collections prepared by individual students.
Students submissions to the Spaces Classroom will be supervised and approved by the teacher.
The Spaces Classroom will be marked as Private by the teacher in the Profile Visibility Setting.
Only the Teacher will have the ability to control this setting in Spaces Classroom.</p> 11.
Rights of California Residents <p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents have the right to request a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed personal information during the previous year for direct marketing purposes.
Wakelet does not share users’ personal information with third-party marketers.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you can request a list of personal information about you we have disclosed to third parties in the preceding calendar year, as well as the names and address of those third parties.
You may make such a request only once per year, and you don’t have to pay for it.
