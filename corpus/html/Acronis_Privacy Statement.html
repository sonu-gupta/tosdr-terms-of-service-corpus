If a particular product, website or service posts its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Statement -- applies when they are inconsistent.</p>
<p>Our right to process personal data also is described in our agreements ("<strong>Customer Agreements</strong>") with our business customers ("<strong>Customers</strong>").
In our Customer Agreements, Acronis is typically contractually prohibited from accessing the personal data that Customers store and otherwise process through Acronis’s Services.
If a provision of a Customer Agreement conflicts or otherwise is inconsistent with a provision of this Privacy Statement, then the term of the Customer Agreement will prevail to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement does not apply to information that is collected by any third-party website or service that you access through the Services.</p>2.
DATA CONTROLLER<p>The data controller (i.e., the person who or entity that determines the purpose and means of processing) for the personal data collected pursuant to this Privacy Statement is Acronis International GmbH, Rheinweg 9, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Please note that when we collect personal data pursuant to a Customer Agreement, we typically act as a data processor on behalf of our Customer.</p>3.
CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS<p>Use of the Services sometimes involves cross-border transfers of personal data.</p>
<p>For cross-border transfers of personal data, Acronis uses appropriate safeguards to require that your personal data be protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable data protection laws.
These safeguards include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (Art.
46 GDPR) and other valid mechanisms for transfers of personal data among our affiliates and data processors.</p>
<p>Acronis complies with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT<p>The Effective Date of this Privacy Statement is set forth at the top of this webpage.

<p>
<strong>Information we receive from others</strong>
</p>
<p>We receive information about you from others, including our vendors, service providers, resellers and other business partners.
We also receive information about you from the third parties that help us operate the Services, such as for fraud detection, digital forensics, marketing services (such as when we acquire information on potential leads) and similar functions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information collected when you use the Services</strong>
</p>
<p>When you use the Services, we collect information about which features you use and how you use them and information about the computer, tablet or mobile telephone ("<strong>Device</strong>") that you use to access the Services (collectively, "<strong>Usage Data</strong>").
Usage Data is personal data under certain privacy laws.</p>
<p>Acronis collects the following Usage Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Services usage information</em>: We collect information about which features you use and how you use them, including: date/time stamps associated with purchase, installation, updates and your usage.
integrations.

information about disabled features.
and information about errors and crashes and activities which led to them.</li>
<li>
<em>Service operation information</em>: Depending on the Services you use, we collect information that is necessary to provide such Services and that forms an integral part of such Services.
For example, we collect the list of software installed on your machine, together with version and manufacturer information as part of providing you vulnerability assessment and patch management functionality of certain Services.
As another example, we collect information about names of potentially malicious files together with their hashes and full paths to such files or blocked website URLs as part of providing you antivirus and URL filtering functionality of certain Services.</li>
<li>
<em>Device information</em>: We collect information from and about the Device that you use to access the Services, including: hardware and software information Device or component ID, type and architecture, Device-specific and operating system settings, characteristics and configuration, device location, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your Device or browser.

Acronis’s servers automatically collect and store in logs your search queries, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, time zones, date and time of your request and referral URLs and certain cookies that identify your browser or Acronis account.
Some logs include metadata which may contain your personal data like names of files and folders if you give them such names.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may link personal data and Usage Data or different types of Usage Data.
We also may link personal data that we collect with publicly-available personal data, such as personal data available in public databases.
If the linked information directly or indirectly identifies an individual natural person, we will treat it as personal data.</p>
<p>
<strong>Voice data</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not keep and process your voice data.
However, some of our products have voice control options available.
If you decide to use them, with your permission, we activate the built-in extension of your Google Chrome browser, which captures your voice via your microphone and transfers it to Google for recognition.
As a result, we receive only a text version of your voice commands, which we do not keep and use only for current command execution.
Since your voice data is processed by Google, the purposes and the ways that Google processes your data may vary depending on your Google account settings (if any) and preferences.
To understand how Google processes your data, including voice data, please carefully read the Google privacy policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).</p>
<p>
<strong>Acronis Customer Experience Program</strong>
</p>
<p>Acronis collects certain information through the Acronis Customer Experience Program ("<strong>CEP</strong>").</p>
<p>Unless you consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP, Acronis will only collect pseudonymized Usage Data as part of CEP.
Acronis gathers such pseudonymized Usage Data to improve Acronis products and services.
Acronis achieves the pseudonymization by associating such data with a randomly generated number (pseudonym) instead of the personal ID associated with your Acronis account.
Acronis cannot identify you by the pseudonym without you providing additional information to Acronis for identification purposes.</p>
<p>If you consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP, Acronis will connect your personal data to your CEP Usage Data.
The personal data Acronis connects to your CEP Usage Data is limited to your Acronis account ID and account information.
As in this case Acronis links personal data and Usage Data, Acronis treats the CEP Usage Data linked to your personal data as personal data.
Your consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP allows Acronis to provide you more specific feedback and guidance about Acronis products, services, and features operation.
You can consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP by checking the corresponding box in the product settings.</p>

<p>The Services use the following cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Strictly necessary cookies</em>, which are required for the operation of the Services, such as to enable you to register or log in to the Services.</li>
<li>
<em>Functionality cookies</em>, which are used to recognize you when you return to the Services.</li>
<li>
<em>Analytical/performance cookies</em>, which allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors to our website, to learn how users navigate the Services and to help us to improve how the Services function.</li>

Google Analytics does not directly identify individual users.</li>
<li>
<em>Advertising and targeting</em> cookies, which are used to deliver tailored information about our products and services that may be of interest or value to you and marketing and promotional emails (with your consent where required by applicable law).</li>

Most browsers allow viewing, managing, deleting or blocking cookies.
Please be aware that if you delete or block cookies directly in your browser then some of your preferences can be lost, as well as some functionality may no longer be available, including the ability to opt-out and mange cookies via the Privacy Preference center as this function itself uses cookie for keeping your preferences.</p>
<p>You may find the guidelines on how to control cookies for common browsers at the links below:</p>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>Our Statement On Do Not Track Signals</strong>
</p>
<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("<strong>DNT</strong>") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.
If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain personal data about the browser’s user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
For this reason, many website operators, including Acronis, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>7.

</strong>
</p>
<p>This California Privacy Rights Notice ("<strong>California Privacy Notice</strong>") explains privacy rights available to residents of the State of California as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("<strong>CCPA</strong>").</p>
<p>If this California Privacy Notice and any provision in the rest of our Privacy Statement conflict, then this California Privacy Notice controls for the processing of Personal Information of residents of the State of California.

(In CCPA, "<strong>sale</strong>" means transferring or making available Personal Information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.)

</strong>
<strong>
<em>Acronis does not sell (within the meaning of CCPA) your Personal Information to third parties and accordingly, we do not provide you with information about how to opt-out of sale of your Personal Information.
